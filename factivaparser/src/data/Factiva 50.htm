<div id="hd"><b>Obese appear to be at greater risk to H1N1; Group considered for priority antiviral distribution list</b>
</div><div>Lee Greenberg   </div>
<div>385 words</div><div>3 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ontario is looking at the possibility that morbidly obese people who contract the H1N1 swine-flu virus are more likely to suffer serious complications or death, says the province's top public-health official.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King says scientists studying the patterns of transmission of the H1N1 flu virus have identified morbidly obese citizens as a group that might be put atop a priority distribution list for antiviral medication.</p>
<p>Ontario plans to begin a dedicated vaccination program targeting H1N1 this fall.</p>
<p>Initial data put obese people on par with pregnant women, people living in remote northern communities, infants and people with pre-existing chronic conditions as groups particularly susceptible to the new strain of influenza.</p>
<p>King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said officials are treating the new link between obesity and H1N1 as "an emerging hypothesis" based on data coming out of Ontario's intensive-care units.</p>
<p>"I would say we would call this emerging information that needs to be better studied at this time," she said, adding morbid obesity "isn't classically listed as a risk factor for complications from the flu."</p>
<p>Nineteen people in Ontario have died and 396 have been hospitalized with H1N1, which first appeared in Ontario in late spring. The virus resulted in mild symptoms for the vast majority of Canadians who contracted it, but can cause severe acute respiratory distress.</p>
<p>King did not offer Ontario-specific data to support the theory, but in July U.S. researchers gave the first glimpse into the possible link.</p>
<p>A study looked at 10 severely ill flu patients at a Michigan hospital who had to be put on ventilators. Nine of the 10 were obese, including seven considered severely obese. Three of the patients died.</p>
<p>"What this study suggests is there can be complications associated with this virus infection, especially in severely obese patients," said Dr. Tim Uyeki, a virus expert with the Center for Disease Control.</p>
<p>The province's order for the vaccine was due Friday but King wouldn't reveal how many doses Ontario is seeking from the drug's Canadian manufacturer, though the expectation is that something less than 100 per cent of the population will be covered.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>10 reasons to celebrate this rainy, sniffly, smelly season; There's a silver lining in the cloud hanging over our summer and here's how it adds up</b>
</div><div>Trish Crawford   </div>

</p>
<p>What the heck's going on with this summer, eh?</p>
<p>Even people who weren't socked in the pocket by the recession didn't feel like vacationing much with all this cloudy, cold, rainy weather.</p>
<p>The outbreak of swine flu and the Toronto civic workers' strike just put the icing on the cake of what is turning out to be a summer to remember - and not in a good way.</p>
<p>But, just as every cloud has a silver lining, there's an upside to this bummer of a summer. In the spirit of the "glass half full," here are 10 good things to celebrate this unsummery summer:</p>
<p>1. Gorgeous Gardens. The grass looks great, the flowers are blooming and lasting for weeks. The city is as green as can be. This cool weather has been kind to lettuce, peas, herbs, carrots, turnips, beets, leafy greens and radishes, says community gardening advocate Susan Berman. She recommends placing a half-filled beer bottle on its side to catch the slugs proliferating in the cool temperatures. "They slither in and they can't get out," so you get to enjoy your crops.</p>
<p>2. No Smog. We've been able to breathe easier this summer as the air quality index hovers in the "very good," "good" and "moderate" range most days. Christine Hampson, president of the Canadian Asthma Society, points out that people whose asthma is triggered by pollution are having a good summer. Fewer particulates in the air, asthma educator Meridene Haynes adds, means less "coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest and shortness of breath," which are the symptoms of an asthma attack.</p>
<p>3. Last-Minute Plans. If you're a procrastinator, you are in luck this summer: it's okay to do things at the last minute. Reservations at Ontario's provincial parks are down this year, as is daily attendance at facilities such as Wasaga Beach Provincial Park. While the 5 per cent drop is nowhere near the nightmare of the summer of '92, when attendance fell 22 per cent (it rained every weekend of the summer), parks official Bruce van Staalduinen says there's lots of availability. Check the website ontarioparks.com.</p>
<p>4. Power Saver. Who needs air conditioning when all you have to do is open the window to cool down? Toronto Hydro says the average homeowner has saved $22 this year, over last year, in reduced electricity demands. While malls and offices may have kept the air conditioning going full blast, other commercial establishments have reduced their power demands as a cost-savings measure in this recession, says Terry Young, spokesman for Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator. No fear of brownouts this summer.</p>
<p>5. Good Deals. Want a golf game with that hotel room? How about a free breakfast or an activity program for the kids? The hard-hit tourist industry is trying to tantalize visitors with tempting deals. Collingwood's Blue Mountain Resort, for example, is offering a graduated discount that kicks in the longer you stay. You get 25 per cent off the second night and 40 per cent off the third night. Spokesperson Kelly O'Neil says this is the first time the resort has given the discount, which "has proven very popular."</p>
<p>6. Swimsuit Reprieve. We've been cuddled in our fleeces this summer and therefore saved the ignominy of exposing our pale flesh in public. Who wants to go swimming when the air and the water are so cold? So, we haven't had to squeeze ourselves into fashionable bikinis or shorts, which has the added benefit of relaxing our hair-removal regimens. If you do go to the beach, there are lots of spaces and picnic tables available. No squabbling over where to put your blanket.</p>
<p>7. Low UV. Although we can still be exposed to cancer-causing ultraviolet rays on cloudy days, this gloomy summer has given us some added protection. Organ transplant recipients or people with a history of melanoma or lupus-related photosensitivity can avoid the sun better when it is overcast. However, dermatologist Cheryl Rosen says she doesn't "go around wishing for rainy, cloudy days." She likes the sun and outdoor activities and recommends sunscreen, hats and shade as methods of avoiding UV radiation.</p>
<p>8. Fewer Traffic Tragedies. Whether all those "staycations" reduced traffic on our highways or not, there have been fewer fatalities. The OPP reports that 153 people have died on the highways this year, down from 170 at this time last year. Most notable was a 50 per cent reduction in alcohol-related deaths. OPP Insp. David Ross says he doesn't think the cooler weather has kept drinking and driving down; he credits heightened police presence on the highways.</p>
<p>9. Stink-Free. Although those living near the large temporary garbage drop-offs certainly got a nose full of smelly garbage, the rest of us really didn't find it too bad during the recent Toronto civic workers strike. Had there been a heat wave, who would not have been offended by that green bin odour wafting from the basement or back shed? Even without a garbage strike, the city usually stinks at this time of year due to pollution, inversions, smog and wind flow from the sewage treatment plants. So far, Toronto has been smelling like a rose.</p>
<p>10. Bragging Rights. Did your child get sent home from a camp decimated by swine flu? Did your mother-in-law move in for a month to take care of the kids while your daycare was on strike? Did it rain every day of your holiday? Were you so broke your vacation was a trip to <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>? Have you not gone swimming once yet? Did you wear a ski jacket to a picnic? Bring it in, people: we've got the best conversation starter of all time - how I spent the summer of 2009.</p>

</p>
<p>3 p.m.: Chali 2Na may have laid down the best set of Rock the Bells, but it was so early on that a lot of people didn't catch it. That said, compared to last weekend's Virgin Festival, it is packed. And the audience is primed to party. The two biggest lineups are the ones for beer and Jamaican food. Alcohol, spice, all nice, yo.</p>
<p>4 p.m.: Honestly, I don't know Tech N9NE's music that well, but the duo was working it. Right up to the extended "show us your [breasts]" stage patter that went on far too long. Not sure which is worse: grown men announcing that they want to get some B.C. women or that so many of the front-row audience members were willing to give the guys what they wanted. Guess you'll have to check it on YouTube. Given the proliferation of cameras on site, I'm sure a number of ladies in the house will be able to remember that dumb thing they did for a long time.</p>
<p>4:15 p.m.: So this Australian girl just walks over, grabs my water out of my hand and starts drinking it. After a few swigs, she gives it back.</p>
<p>I ask, "So, you don't have swine flu or anything?"</p>
<p>"No, just herpes, but I don't have any right now," she replies.</p>
<p>Um, alrighty then.</p>
<p>4:45 p.m.: Mike Louis of New Westminster is hanging by the lemonade tent with gal and kid. Is he a big hip-hop fan?</p>
<p>"Not at all. I'm just here for the beer garden, the good donair and a chick showing her a--. So far, that's what I liked."</p>
<p>5:15 p.m.: Host Supernatural does a freestyle during which he mimics Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes and others. And he does it really well. So what does he sound like on his own? Not as good as the people he's copying. Might want to rethink that concept.</p>
<p>5:30 p.m.: A whole lot of people smoked an awful lot of pot to Cypress Hill. B Real may be a host, but he lays down some gems from the Hill's catalogue and gets the crowd fully pimped up. Musically speaking, it's one of the day's highlights. Well, that and reading all the really bad thug tattoos. Who gets "Live now, die later" across their chest without realizing that it's stupid? As in, "duh."</p>
<p>6:10 p.m.: I can't believe that it's almost six hours in before a DJ finally gets down to some mix-mastery. But it happens. And it's so . . . mediocre. What up with that? We've got club turntablists who could clean up against this guy. Weird.</p>
<p>6:30 p.m.: OK, after some thought, I just have to stick to my initial impression of Common's set. It sucked. One fest-goer suggested that perhaps he's been doing band tours too much to actually remember how to do the solo man with a mic thing. Maybe, but with the exception of a freestyle that referenced Granville, Mt. Seymour and B.C. bud, he didn't do a thing. Kind of a drag given how much I love the guy's work. Guess everyone's entitled to a bad day.</p>
<p>6:45 p.m.: Chat with local hip-hop promoter Sean Lalla about why it took so long to get Rock the Bells to come here.</p>
<p>"This city is still an unproven market for hip hop and we don't get that many tours for that reason," he says. "Today is a bit of a test case to see if we are good or not. We'll see at the end of the day, but this looks really good."</p>
<p>Word is Vancouver outsold Toronto. But they are kinda spoiled for urban music there.</p>
<p>7 p.m.: All is good in the universe now that Rza is just killing it. He's got the crowd rapping along -- many of whom might not have been born when the Wu-Tang released its awesome debut. He has people chatting "O.D.B." as he introduces the late Old Dirty Bastard's son, Boy Jones.</p>
<p>The party is on as the sun starts to set. Booty-shaking bathing suit beauties and b-boys are getting into a groove.</p>
<p>This is the sort of event I want more of. Please. Less rock, more rap.</p>

</div><div>Chuck Chiang </div>

</p>
<p>Johnny Tschetter is used to arriving at the Cluny Hutterite Colony's hog barn to a flurry of noise and activity from the facility's herd of 15,000 pigs. On Saturday, however, there was only silence.</p>
<p>"I woke up today, and this is a whole different place," said Tschetter, who has worked at the barn for 10 years. "It used to be full of life. Now, it's full of death."</p>
<p>The barn, a 118,000-square-foot facility that provides the colony with 75 per cent of its income, lay in ruins Saturday after a massive blaze swept through and demolished the building--taking all the livestock with it.</p>
<p>No one was injured.</p>
<p>The fire is the latest -- and the most devastating--blow to the colony's livelihood, following years of low hog prices, this spring's drought and the panic brought on by the H1N1 outbreak. Fire officials say the fire struck at about 6:30 p. m. Friday, and it was likely sparked by mechanical parts in the feed mill inside the barn.</p>
<p>The barn would cost $10 million to rebuild, Tschetter estimates.</p>
<p>Ironically, the steel-and-concrete building was labelled "fireproof" by colony members. It is one of the reasons why the colony didn't have insurance on the barn.</p>
<p>"The last three years hammered us to our knees," Tschetter said, adding low hog prices have already pushed the operation into the red. "We try to cut corners to keep things going."</p>
<p>The building contained seven tonnes of feed, which likely caught fire, said Frank Tschetter, Johnny's father and the colony's financial secretary.</p>
<p>"(The cause) could have been a mechanical belt that slipped too much," Frank Tschetter said at the scene of the fire Saturday, still visibly shaken. "The electrical (system) wasn't the problem."</p>
<p>According to the younger Tschetter--the first person to arrive on the scene--the blaze went from its first visible signs to an inferno in less than 20 minutes. The fire drew crews from Cluny, Gleichen, Strathmore, Dalum and the Siksika First Nation, but it was still not enough to save the building from burning to a total loss.</p>
<p>"By the time (Johnny) got here, he couldn't walk in anymore," Frank Tschetter said. "Chances are, even with the fire department right here, it would have been hard to save it."</p>
<p>The loss of the barn was a shock to the entire colony of 79 members, as well as the nearby town of Cluny, some 100 kilometres east of Calgary.</p>
<p>About 20 Hutterite members from Cluny and elsewhere could be seen gathered at the barn's parking lot Saturday, silently watching the building's smouldering remains.</p>
<p>In Cluny, residents were equally in disbelief. Peter Huyzer, owner of Pete's Bakery and P. J.'s Liquor Store, helped build the barn between 1996 and 1997.He recalled seeing the smoke emerge from the horizon Friday.</p>
<p>"I thought it was just a house. But it was too big a cloud of smoke."</p>
<p>Crews on Friday described the blaze's smoke as looking more like a massive rain cloud than a fire plume. Fire officials say they will be back at the site Monday to determine the exact cause. As for the colony, Tschetter said they will take the future of the group's finances one step at a time.</p>
<p>"We're going to sit back for two weeks and think about it," he said. "But we know we're not going to rebuild it. It wouldn't make sense with the financial crisis...the hog industry's done."</p>
<p>Johnny Tschetter said the colony has other forms of income -- some dairy and beef cattle, farmland and other agricultural-related items--but with the dry spring this year already cutting into the harvest volume, the financial future of the colony is murky.</p>
<p>The barn employed roughly 10 per cent of the colony's residents, and Johnny Tschetter added the loss of the animals is especially hard to take.</p>
<p>"You can be pretty attached," he said. "Imagine having your dog and times that by 15,000. Then imagine how you'd feel. You see them every day. You feed them, you play with them. You shouldn't become attached to them, but you do."</p>
<p>The elder Tschetter, meanwhile, said there is a bright side to the tale. "I'm just glad our people didn't die in it," he said. "We had some people we had to restrain from jumping (into the burning barn). That's our life there."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Batting Disorder; No one knows why more ballplayers than ever are battling anxiety and depression. But is the disabled list the place to send them for help?</b>
</div><div>John Jeansonne   </div>
<div>Newsday</div>
<div>842 words</div><div>2 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>In 18 years as the New York Mets' team psychiatrist, Dr. Allan Lans regularly witnessed player insecurity, depression and grief.</p>
<p>But the recent wave of major-leaguers becoming so stressed that they have been assigned to the disabled list has moved Lans, now a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, to call social anxiety disorder "the swine flu of baseball -- it's flat-out crazy."</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the All-Star break, three players -- one of them on two different occasions -- were formally placed on the DL by anxiety diagnoses.</p>
<p>Just as Kansas City pitcher Zack Greinke was sidelined three years ago, Detroit pitcher Dontrelle Willis, St. Louis shortstop Khalil Greene and, most famously, Cincinnati first baseman Joey Votto have missed playing time this season for non-physical issues.</p>
<p>Greene made a second trip to the DL on June 30 after falling into another unsettling batting slump.</p>
<p>Experts remind that debilitating strains of performing in the world of elite competitive sports hardly are new.</p>
<p>Baseball historians recall some paralyzing doubts, after their first taste of the big leagues, expressed by no less than Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle a half-century ago. But it hardly is clear whether anxiety disorder is spreading, is more widely reported, or is possibly overdiagnosed lately.</p>
<p>"Many, many athletes I see are suffering from anxiety and it's always been there," says Tom Ferraro, a respected New York sports psychologist who has worked with athletes and celebrities for more than 20 years. "The pressure, being on stage and under scrutiny, this is not easy.</p>
<p>"To get a baseball player or a general manager to put a high-level athlete on the disabled list, rest assured, it's not a mild tension."</p>
<p>Lans agreed that "anxiety disorders are very real," and cautions -- as does Ferraro -- that cases must be judged individually and with thorough knowledge of the player's personal history.</p>
<p>There are multiple sources for feeling sad and low -- Votto cited his father's death last August while Greene admitted he was "internalizing" poor performance -- but Lans noted that "feeling depressed is not depression" and that, in many situations involving young ballplayers, "they're suffering from adolescence, and that's not an illness."</p>
<p>Anxiety, after all, "is normally part of any performance," Lans said. Think of the oft-mentioned "butterflies" experienced by athletes and performers in the arts world, even people giving speeches or talking around an office board table.</p>
<p>"It's a regulatory thing, like getting up in front of the class and giving a talk," he says. "You need a certain edge to perform at your highest level, the thing you see with pitchers -- like bullfighters -- going though a ritual. You learn to control it and, once you start performing, it goes away."</p>
<p>Furthermore, baseball players build up a sort of immunity.</p>
<p>As they advance from school teams to minor leagues to the big time -- to the growing crowds and media and competition -- they develop a resistance or sorts.</p>
<p>"But to suddenly develop anxiety disorders (in the majors)," says Lans, "that's an unlikely setting for these to evolve."</p>
<p>Ferraro argues there "are many issues related to depression in athletes. Physical injuries create major depression, or personal loss. Baseball is an abnormal environment. Players are traded, they're benched, or, like Chuck Knoblauch or Steve Sax, they suddenly can't throw. It's a recipe for anxiety and depression."</p>
<p>Lans and Ferraro agree that a relationship of trust with a trained psychiatrist or psychologist is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. And that anti-anxiety drugs are, at best, a last resort.</p>
<p>"A professional psychologist does one thing and one thing only," Ferraro says, "and that is give them time to talk. Listen. On a regular basis. Let them ventilate."</p>
<p>To Lans, putting a player on the disabled list "makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>"In the general public, when you see a very depressed person, you don't put him in the hospital. That makes it worse, because then he'll think he's crazy. At all costs, the guy should be kept at work.</p>
<p>"Baseball is a wonderful thing because, when the game starts, the only thing in the world is the game itself. It's a treatment. Why do any of us go to games? Turn off the cellphone and everything else goes away."</p>
<p>When Mays, one-for-his-first-26 major league at-bats in the early 1950s, despondently asked manager Leo Durocher, "Mr. Leo, send me back (to the minors)," Durocher told Mays not to worry, that he would be the New York Giants' centrefielder as long as Durocher was manager, and the healing began.</p>
<p>In a game in which dealing with failure is paramount, Lans says, there must be that understanding that "kids need something more than at-bats."</p>

<p>A hog barn lay in ruins yesterday after a massive blaze swept through and demolished the building -- taking all the livestock with it.</p>
<p>The Cluny Hutterite Colony's hog barn, located about 100 kilometres east of Calgary, was a 118,000-square-foot facility that provided the colony with 75 per cent of its income.</p>
<p>The facility had a herd of about 15,000 pigs.</p>
<p>No one was injured.</p>
<p>The fire is the latest -- and the most devastating -- blow to the colony's livelihood, following years of low hog prices, this spring's drought and the panic brought on by the H1N1 outbreak. Fire officials say the fire struck at about 6:30 p.m. Friday, and it was likely sparked by mechanical parts in the feed mill inside the barn.</p>
<p>The building contained seven tonnes of feed, which likely caught fire, said Frank Tschetter, the colony's financial secretary.</p>
<p>According to the Johnny Tschetter -- Franks's son and the first person to arrive on the scene -- the blaze went from its first visible signs to an inferno in less than 20 minutes. The fire drew several crews, but the building burned to a total loss.</p>
<p>The barn would cost $10 million to rebuild, Tschetter estimates. Ironically, the steel-and-concrete building was labelled "fireproof" by colony members -- one of the reasons why the colony didn't have insurance on it.</p>

<p>The influenza A (H1N1) pandemic is now unstoppable. The world missed its chance, and containment is no longer a possibility. Efforts to contain the outbreak were impeded by the consistent downplaying of the extent and immediacy of the threat. Those influential "voices of reason" that restrained the World Health Organization from issuing stronger, earlier warnings also lulled governments into complacency.</p>
<p>Yet even as the virus spreads to every corner of the world and the realization of its seriousness sinks in, those same voices are dampening the sense of urgency necessary to mount an effective response.</p>
<p>Most of all, the threat is being obscured by the misleading statement that only a few will develop serious symptoms and die. It is true that only a small fraction of those infected are likely to die; the global fatality rate is currently 0.45 per cent or four or five in a thousand. But what happens once the number of those infected rises into the millions? The fatality rate may remain low, but the number of fatalities will no longer be few.</p>
<p>Just how severe is the threat? Recently, Britain's chief medical officer reported that modelling studies indicated that up to 65,000 people in that country could die. Projected globally, this worst-case estimate suggests the potential for 6.5 million deaths. Except that Britain's current fatality rate, as well as the higher rate that yielded the 65,000 figure, are both lower than the average global rate right now.</p>
<p>To calculate the potential fatalities worldwide, one must estimate the number of people likely to become infected (the clinical attack rate) and the percentage among them likely to die (the fatality rate). So far, the observed attack rate has been 30 per cent, meaning one in three who are exposed to the virus becomes infected. This suggests that more than two billion people are likely to be infected through successive waves of the pandemic over the next few months. Based on the observed global fatality rate of 0.45 to 0.5 per cent, between nine million and 10 million could die.</p>
<p>This global fatality rate, however, reflects current conditions. Some favourable factors may have kept the numbers down to date.</p>
<p>First, the virus initially appeared in mostly developed, northern hemisphere countries experiencing summer conditions. As the pandemic has spread to the southern hemisphere, we are seeing cases such as Argentina, where the fatality rate is five times higher, around 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Second, at this stage, health systems have had to cope with relatively low numbers of patients, though in many cases they have still been overwhelmed. As the trickle turns into a flood, the capacity of these systems to identify those most at risk and to provide the best treatments may diminish. Again, the experience in the countries most affected so far shows that not only the number of fatalities but also the fatality rate increases with the number of cases.</p>
<p>Efforts to play down the threat are predicated on the idea that one must avoid creating panic. That reveals a condescending view of the public as a mindless mob prone to irrational behaviour. A well-explained, sober and objective assessment does not generate panic, especially if it lays the groundwork for preparedness and is accompanied by clear guidelines for the public, medical authorities, front-line responders, health personnel and employers.</p>
<p>What creates panic is watching unexpected developments -- like the sudden appearance and rapid spread of the virus in a community, accompanied by a spike in fatalities -- when all the public had experienced previously were attempts to lull it into complacency.</p>
<p>As WHO director general Margaret Chan said in a speech on July 2 in Mexico: "Between the extremes of panic and complacency lies the solid ground of vigilance." Too many in government insist on lingering on the ground of complacency until they are pushed into panic by their lack of preparedness. How many deaths will it take to shake them into timely, thoughtful, targeted and</p>
<p>co-ordinated action?</p>

<p>All magazines and toys should be removed from emergency department waiting rooms and acute-care clinics to reduce exposure to human swine flu, federal health officials are recommending.</p>
<p>Updated guidelines to help slow H1N1's spread also call for separate triage areas for suspected cases or, barring that, designating an area in a waiting room where patients with flu-like illnesses can be segregated -- "ideally by two metres" -- from others.</p>
<p>Evidence so far suggests that the incubation period for H1N1 is up to seven days, and that people may remain infectious for up to seven days, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, which has released updated guidelines for health-care workers and first responders, including paramedics, ambulance attendants, firefighters and police.</p>
<p>THE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND:</p>
<p>- Putting surgical masks on all patients with respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat and fever. The guidelines note that fever hasn't been a consistent symptom with H1N1, especially in children under five and adults 65 and older, but that gastrointestinal symptoms may be present in kids under five.</p>
<p>- Treating suspect cases in single rooms. If a single room isn't available, "patients with infection due to the same micro-organism may be cohorted," meaning clustered together.</p>
<p>- Gloves and gowns should be worn by hospital workers when entering the room of a suspect case; special close-fitting respirators and eye protection should be worn during "aerosol-generating" medical procedures.</p>
<p>- Dispatchers should question callers to determine whether anyone at the "incident location" may have H1N1, and first responders should wear masks when within two metres of a suspect case.</p>
<p>- Suspected cases should be transported separately and paramedics should call ahead to the hospital to alert emergency staff.</p>
<p>- Patients should be kept in the ambulance until the hospital is ready.</p>
<p>"This is essentially what we did in SARS, we figured out what worked, and what didn't," said Kumanan Wilson, a scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute.</p>
<p>H1N1 has so far been mild, with most patients making a full recovery. Scientists said the virus appears to be more or less stable, from a genetic standpoint, and that it would take a significant genetic change to increase virulence.</p>
<p>But the clinical picture could change.</p>
<p>The government said its prevention and control guidelines may change as the virus evolves and spreads throughout the world.</p>
<p>For now, the guidelines recommend removing magazines and toys from waiting rooms "to reduce potential contact exposure."</p>
<p>As of Thursday, 59 swine-flu related deaths had been reported across Canada.</p>

<p>While he doesn't say it in so many words, you get the feeling that Premier Brad Wall has advanced well past the stage of being happy simply to be here.</p>
<p>As he prepares to host the Council of the Federation meeting at Government House in Regina, Wall's personal expectations seem to be significantly higher for this year's event. Whether he meets those expectations we'll know in a week, but one thing is certain: We will witness a very different Saskatchewan leader than we saw a year ago.</p>
<p>Oh sure, he's dealing with many of the same old economic and political problems, but ones that have grown significantly more severe since then. Last year's Quebec City gathering of provincial and territorial leaders came well before the October stock market crash that ravaged the manufacturing economies of Central Canada in particular.</p>
<p>What can be done to translate infrastructure dollars into a recovery will be the dominant story from this meeting, because the economy remain the biggest issue for all the premiers -- even for Wall, whose province faces an economic decline of 2.7 per cent if the forecast by the Conference Board of Canada comes to fruition.</p>
<p>You may recall that the big issue to emerge from the Quebec City summit in 2008 was provincial heavyweights -- Ontario's Dalton McGuinty, Quebec's Jean Charest, Manitoba's Gary Doer and B.C.'s Gordon Campbell -- signing on to the Western Climate Initiative that promoted the "cap and trade" approach. The plan was to "cap" greenhouse gas emissions and trade credits with "green" companies.</p>
<p>Wall then found himself on the opposite side of the issue, aligned with Alberta's Ed Stelmach in advocating investments in carbon capture and storage. This stance saw him either play second banana to Stelmach on the issue, be portrayed as a stooge for Prime Minister Stephen Harper or simply get ignored. At the televised press conference that wrapped up the Quebec City meeting, the national TV networks either cut away when Wall spoke or misidentified him as the premier of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Let's fast-forward a year. Saskatchewan not only is exploring nuclear power, but its record on emission reductions is something less than stellar. Wall's Saskatchewan Party acknowledged this spring it would be breaking its election promise to reduce emissions by 32 per cent by 2020.</p>
<p>Several environmental groups, which include Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and the David Suzuki Foundation, are converging on the premiers' conference. They promote it as the "Showdown in Regina," although it appears Stelmach and his oilsands will be the environmentalists' biggest targets.</p>
<p>But lest one thinks Wall will be satisfied to remain in the background while other premiers or interest groups advance their agenda, think again. In an interview to run in Tuesday's newspaper, the premier left the distinct impression that he is taking his role as this year's chair of the Council of the Federation very seriously and that he's eager to advance talks on making the transition to the new innovation-and knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>Of course, that's easier said than done. Besides the usual problem of having one's agenda sidetracked by outside interest groups, there are several other pressing issues on the table. Employment Insurance, a strategy to deal with H1N1, pensions (particularly important to Quebec), and First Nations relations will vie with economic and environmental issues for public attention. And as the premier of a small province, Wall isn't a magnet for the attention of the national media automatically.</p>
<p>However, he's got another year under this belt and built a solid national profile, lauded by the media and even touted as possible successor to Harper. Plus he has solid relations with many of the other premiers. He and Campbell appear to be tight, and Wall seems to have a solid enough relationship with McGuinty and Charest. It will be interesting to hear what they have to say, particularly if they are in sync with Wall's innovation and development agenda.</p>
<p>You might also notice that Wall has developed a capacity for both charm and diplomacy. He might be seen as the honest broker between the premiers and Harper.</p>
<p>What you are pretty much guaranteed to see is a very different Wall from the one we saw a year ago.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Gay Pride Week a boon for local businesses; Costume and other retail stores, restaurants, hotels and night clubs cash in on the celebrations in the West End</b>
</div><div>Gerry Bellett </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>701 words</div><div>1 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>

<p>Lots of feathers, lots of sequins, lots of uniforms and all kinds of cross-dressing -- throw in a slight surge for Michael Jackson accoutrements -- and that's what's going out the door this week from Carol's Costume Corner in North Vancouver.</p>
<p>Gay Pride Week is one of the busiest of the year in terms of sales, says owner Laurie Sluchinski, as it is for many other businesses catering to the gay community.</p>
<p>For costume rentals, it can be compared with Halloween "but with a lot less layering."</p>
<p>Sluchinski's store is some distance from Vancouver's West End where much of the economic action associated with Gay Pride Week takes place, but over the years it has become a place to find a fancy dress.</p>
<p>She is also outfitting some of the floats for Sunday's Gay Pride Parade, but how they and the people aboard will be decked out is a secret.</p>
<p>"Can't give away any ideas on the floats," she said.</p>
<p>"But this year, if there's any fad, I'd have to say people are dancing around the idea of Michael Jackson, although I expect that will be big this year at Halloween.</p>
<p>"But the classic stuff is still strong: cowboys, sailors, showgirls and the circus. And lots of cross-dressing," Sluchinski said.</p>
<p>There is no way to put a dollar figure on what the Gay Pride celebrations put into the tills of local businesses, says Lyn Hellyar of the West End Business Improvement Association, except that it must have a huge effect.</p>
<p>"We don't have any figures showing the economic impact, but we know that it brings in a huge influx of tourists not just for Pride Week but in the weeks before and after the event. People build their holidays around it," Hellyar said.</p>
<p>"For many businesses in the West End it's like another Christmas. Obviously, the people coming here are spending money in hotels, restaurants, and will be shopping in stores throughout the city. If you just walk through the West End you can see it," she said.</p>
<p>The Odyssey Nightclub on Howe Street, like many other gay bars and clubs, will experience its biggest week of the year in terms of revenue, said spokesman Kip Tastic.</p>
<p>The club has already sold out admittance tickets for tonight, when it will hold its Fallen Angel Party, as well as many of the tickets for Sunday's Feather Boa Pride Ball featuring drag queen Joan-e.</p>
<p>At the Best Western Chateau Granville, hotel sales director John Chao said Gay Pride celebrations have helped what is a troubled year for hotels battling the effects of a poor economy and swine flu scares, which are keeping people at home.</p>
<p>"We are almost full, just about sold out this weekend," Chao said of the 150-suite hotel. "It's a definite benefit for business."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sluchinski was expecting the rush for costumes to peak today as people get dolled up for the weekend parties.</p>
<p>"They'll be in for costumes and makeup. They'll be putting on their makeup with friends over cocktails.</p>
<p>"Sometimes those lashes can take quite a while."</p>

<p>B.C. A POPULAR PLACE FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGES</p>
<p>Gays and lesbians have travelled from around the world to get married in British Columbia. Here are the number of same-sex marriages since it became legal nationwide in July 2003:</p>
<p>2003, July through Dec.: 733</p>
<p>2004: 1,064</p>
<p>2005: 1,023</p>
<p>2006: 1,063</p>
<p>2007: 862</p>
<p>2008: 732</p>
<p>Last year, 848 of the 1,464 brides and grooms were Canadians, nearly all of whom lived in B.C. But 482 Americans from 38 states tied the knot in B.C. Countries from Australia to United Arab Emirates accounted for 134 other brides and grooms.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu scare a boon to body-bag sales; Pandemic fears creating customers far and wide for Toronto company's sombre product line</b>
</div><div>Dave Feschuk </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1000 words</div><div>1 August 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>As concerns grow of a possible flu pandemic onslaught this autumn, alert authorities worldwide have been stockpiling emergency supplies. Masks, gloves and anti-viral medications are on the list. And body bags.</p>
<p>Demand for the latter is prompting a surge of interest in the wares of a small Toronto custom bag manufacturer named Trevor Owen Ltd. Inquiries about its pandemic body bags are pouring in from as far away as the Sultanate of Oman on the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Trevor Owen recently shipped several thousand of the thick plastic bags - sewn in its Scarborough factory and touted for their ability to "prevent leakage and seepage of bodily fluids" - to Alberta. It is bidding on a contract to supply Ohio with 12,500 of the white woven polyethylene pandemic bags.</p>
<p>"Some seniors' residences are starting to buy five, 10 or 15 at a time," said Trevor Owen president Pierre Barcik.</p>
<p>"There are state and provincial governments that are starting to stockpile pandemic body bags ... It's a bad pun, but (the business) is growing."</p>
<p>The general fear is that the traditional fall flu season will this time bring a surge in H1N1 swine flu cases - and deaths.</p>
<p>Microbiologist Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control for Mount Sinai Hospital, recently warned there would be more deaths and infections in the city as a result of the labour disruption at Toronto Public Health.</p>
<p>Trevor Owen is not the only supplier thriving because of the fears. Richard Miller, owner of the U.S.-based web portal ToDieFor.Biz that sells a line of body bags, said demand has doubled this year.</p>
<p>Although the competition is considerable, Barcik's company appears to have found a niche with its pandemic body bag, which differs from the bag typically used to transport and temporarily store the dead.</p>
<p>While morgues and hospitals mostly use bags made of light-duty plastic - glorified garbage bags with a zipper down the middle - the pandemic body bag's material is thicker and stronger, comparable to a light tarp.</p>
<p>It is coated on both sides with polyurethane for imperviousness and can be outfitted with six carry handles, an option that allows for the possibility of inexperienced personnel hastily hauling bodies at a time of crisis.</p>
<p>"It basically lets you handle bigger bodies with less care," said Barcik.</p>
<p>"I don't suggest we should handle the dead with anything but the utmost care, but if you've got a couple of volunteers moving people around in a pandemic centre, it's a lot different than a morgue situation."</p>
<p>Hauling death isn't Trevor Owen's stock and trade. Barcik's company makes a variety of bags for everyday functions, from the giant padded envelopes that keep your pizza warm on its delivery route to the heavy-duty duffles in which hockey players like the Ontario Hockey League's Soo Greyhounds tote their gear.</p>
<p>Still, Trevor Owen carries a substantial array of body bags; it's a sector that appears to require a diversified product line.</p>
<p>Cindy Maguire, the controller of Centennial Products, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based distributor of body bags whose customers include public health centres in Nova Scotia, said that among coroners and other tenders to the departed, body bags "are like a fashion statement, almost.</p>
<p>"People are very particular about colour, style, the seal of the bag, the zipper."</p>
<p>Some coroners are partial to blue bags, which are known to provide a photo-friendly background for making a visual record of autopsies. Fluorescent orange bags are often the choice of urban police personnel who frequently work in darkness.</p>
<p>And manufacturers say there is growing demand for extra-large bags, such as the widely used Chinese-made bag known as the "Big Girtha" in the Trevor Owen catalogue.</p>
<p>Where a standard body bag runs about three feet wide and seven feet long, the Big Girtha is close to five feet by nine feet.</p>
<p>Said Miller at ToDieFor.Biz: "It's for the 600-pounders. Our population is getting bigger. It's made of very, very heavy-duty material."</p>
<p>If death, by fat or by flu, is a heavy subject, some in the body-bag trade - the death-care industry, in its gentile parlance - see its lighter side. Maguire's company designs and sells novelty T-shirts that have become popular among customers. One is emblazoned with the company's slogan, "You tag it, we bag it."</p>
<p>Another cribs a coroner's theoretical lament during an obesity epidemic: "I think I need a bigger bag."</p>
<p>Said Maguire: "The coroners do have a little bit of a morbid sense of humour. But I guess they use that to get through what they do."</p>
<p>Barcik, whose company employs about 25 workers in an industrial mall near Eglinton and McCowan, said he expects body bags to remain a small part of his operation - currently about 10 per cent.</p>
<p>He takes visible pride in showing a visitor a custom tote manufactured in Scarborough for paramedics with Toronto Emergency Medical Services.</p>
<p>It's a bag, he notes, that could help save a life rather than simply contain the remnants of a lost one.</p>
<p>Not that body bags don't have various uses.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the spectre of the flu pandemic that got his phone ringing, Barcik said he has fielded calls from private citizens shopping for a single body bag for unstated purposes.</p>
<p>"There's a bunch of nutty folks out there," he said with a chuckle, recalling a summer hire at the plant "who was a little bit too goth - he wanted to get in a bag, take one home.</p>
<p>"It's your party, man. Have a good time."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Council approves contracts 21-17 as services resume; Miller estimates changes in sick-day plan will save $140-million over five years</b>
</div><div>JENNIFER LEWINGTON AND BRODIE FENLON </div>
<div>940 words</div><div>1 August 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>A 39-day strike by Toronto civic workers is officially over after city council approved a three-year contract, but bitter, politically charged recriminations may linger for some time.</p>
<p>Even before council's vote of 21-17 – a narrower margin of victory for Mayor David Miller than usual – many city services resumed early yesterday, with a cleanup of temporary garbage dumps held up until the green light from city hall.</p>
<p>Five new collective agreements with Locals 79 and 416 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees include annual wage increases of 1.75 per cent in 2009, 2 per cent in 2010 and 2.25 per cent in 2011, costing $75.6-million over the next three years.</p>
<p>The most controversial feature of the deal is a provision to phase out, but not immediately scrap, a long-standing benefit that allows current employees to cash out unused sick days, to a maximum of six months pay at retirement. The perk will not be extended to new employees, who will enroll in a new short-term disability plan.</p>
<p>“We met all of our bargaining goals,” said Mr. Miller, defending a deal that drew intense criticism from right-leaning councillors and some members of the public as capitulation to union demands.</p>
<p>Asked how he will sell a skeptical public on the fact the perk was grandfathered for existing employees, not scrapped, Mr. Miller said “the facts speak for themselves.”</p>
<p>He pointed to estimated savings of $140-million over the next five years as some employees retire and others opt to cash in the accumulated sick days now and switch to the new short-term disability plan.</p>
<p>After the vote, Local 416 president Mark Ferguson said he anticipated “a mood of elation” among members, as it ended any risk of a resumption of the strike had council rejected the tentative settlement reached earlier this week.</p>
<p>Relief at the strike's end was a widely shared emotion, with behind-the-scenes evidence that neither the city nor its unions could endure the dispute much longer.</p>
<p>For the city, any declaration of public health concerns could have triggered provincial back-to-work legislation and arbitration that, in Mr. Miller's view, would have wiped out any chance of addressing the sick leave benefit.</p>
<p>And the clock was ticking.</p>
<p>Toronto medical officer of health David McKeown said “as we approached the end of July, and were moving into the sixth week of suspension of service, I began to become quite concerned.”</p>
<p>He cited the “cumulative impact” of a loss of services to high-risk infants and pregnant teens, no regular health inspections of restaurants and the need to intensify preparations for a possible fall outbreak of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>“Had the labour disruption gone on, we would not have been able to do everything we needed to do to prepare for the fall,” said Dr. McKeown, who gave regular updates to the provincial chief medical officer of health, top city officials and Mr. Miller's office. He said he had not made a recommendation about the strike's impact, but was getting close to doing so.</p>
<p>For the unions, the pressure was internal in nature. Their members were about to lose of a third regular paycheque, and almost 1,000 strikers had already asked to cross the picket lines and return to work.</p>
<p>Throughout the strike, Mr. Miller's leadership came under intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>In yesterday's debate, a usually loyal ally, Councillor Joe Mihevc (Ward 21, St. Paul's), tartly summed up the issue: “We don't have a content problem with this deal, we have a communications problem with this deal.”</p>
<p>The mayor's critics charged he was too distant from the talks, urging him to intervene as had his predecessor, Mel Lastman, who acceded to job security provisions that he later came to regret.</p>
<p>By contrast, Mr. Miller is of the firm belief that city officials, on instructions from the politicians, take the lead in negotiations. He is known to have contacted union leaders only once during the strike, on July 10, when he called to let them know he was about to go public with the city's offer.</p>
<p>“All the negotiations took place at the table,” said Mr. Ferguson. “That's where the deal was struck.”</p>
<p>Also unlike Mr. Lastman, the mayor does not rely on an informal “kitchen cabinet,” preferring to receive advice from bureaucrats, a close-knit team of advisers and some councillors.</p>
<p>“He pulls in the information he needs and then filters the information and makes a decision,” says Councillor Pam McConnell (Ward 28, Toronto Centre-Rosedale), citing his lawyerly, scholarly bent.</p>
<p>A fierce Miller loyalist, she is dismayed at the sight of the mayor under siege from critics and the media at what she sees as “his greatest moment: he was able to do something absolutely impossible, get a good reasonable settlement.”</p>
<p>But former Etobicoke mayor and now councillor Doug Holyday (Ward 3 Etobicoke Centre), a frequent critic of Mr. Miller who voted with him yesterday, said “he's tried to be all things to all people” in the strike, praising residents and city workers. “It does make you wonder who's side he's on at times.”</p>
<p>At council, it emerged that only 15,000 employees currently qualify to bank sick days, with 5,000 aged 55 years or older. When they retire, they would be replaced by new hires ineligible for the perk.</p>

<p>"This is essentially what we did with SARS: we figured out what worked, and what didn't," said Kumanan Wilson, a scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute.</p>
<p>"If someone appears to have an illness, they'll isolate them; people who come into contact with them will wear a mask, they'll wear gloves so as not to spread it from person to person within the same health-care institution."</p>
<p>There will be logistical challenges. An anticipated second wave could overburden emergency departments and acute-care clinics, and there won't be enough rooms to care for patients in isolation.</p>
<p>"The big part is to try to limit spread in these settings among patients. That's a bit tricky when you've got one waiting room and you're going to triage and put your respiratory patients off in some part that is farther from others," said Earl Brown, executive director of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"The important number here is two metres - two metres is the closest you want anybody infected to be to anyone else, without all these precautions."</p>
<p>H1N1 has so far been mild, with most patients making a full recovery. Scientists said the virus appears to be more or less stable, from a genetic standpoint, and that it would take a significant genetic change to increase virulence.</p>
<p>But the clinical picture could change. The government said its prevention and control guidelines may change as the virus evolves and spreads throughout the world.</p>
<p>For now, the guidelines recommend removing magazines and toys from waiting rooms "to reduce potential contact exposure." Studies have shown that toys can be contaminated with bacteria. The technical word is "fomites" - inanimate objects that can be carriers of contamination. Studies dating back to the 1930s and '40s have shown that fomites can be "absolutely critical" for spreading different viruses, Brown said.</p>
<p>Influenza spreads by spray - tiny droplets caused by coughing and sneezing - and by fomites.</p>
<p>"It's really being aware of the possible ways for transmission with this virus, and saying, if we're going to have a lot of it, or if there's a chance it becomes more severe, we want to control spread," Brown said.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, 59 swine flu-related deaths had been reported across Canada.</p>

<p>Re: "Jurisdictional bickering can threaten our health" (Editorial, July 29).</p>
<p>The Gazette sees the big picture: Protecting Canadians from an H1N1 flu outbreak is what matters, and governments can't let jurisdictional wrangles get in the way. Canada needs a plan to protect Canadians in every community, and the federal government needs to work with provinces, territories, and municipalities to hammer out the details right away. Municipalities have no intention of "passing the buck" on pandemic preparedness, but local governments can't do it alone.</p>
<p>All orders of government must work together, and the federal government must provide national leadership and co-ordination. Canada needs to keep its front-line workers - including police, firefighters, and bus and subway operators - healthy and on the job. They need timely access to vaccinations, but also access to national supplies of anti-viral medications and personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>Quebec hasn't allowed political boundaries to keep it from integrating provincial and local pandemic plans. That's why its communities are among the best equipped to fight an H1N1 outbreak. Ottawa must now take the lead in sharing these lessons with all regions and implementing a plan that protects all communities and the critical services they rely on.</p>

<p>Re: "Who's first in line for H1N1 vaccine? Pregnant women to get priority" (Gazette, July 30).</p>
<p>Inoculating pregnant women with a soup of foreign proteins may be like playing Russian roulette with the lives of unborn babies, let alone their mothers. Where are the data that prove either the safety or the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing H1N1 flu, as medical authorities in the United States proclaim? In the words of WHO vaccine specialist Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, "to be absolutely honest ... it's only after you have a large-scale distribution of vaccine that you know with certainty the safety profile of the vaccine." ("H1N1 vaccine taking longer than expected," Gazette, July 14).</p>
<p>That same article cites neurological disorders following use of a vaccine rushed into service in 1976.</p>
<p>In Canada data don't exist, simply because the vaccine is still under production, according to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, and might not be available until November, following a month of clinical trials. Understandably, our chief public-health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, and his team are reluctant at this time to adopt the above priority list.</p>

</p>
<p>Guelph food industry promoter Lilian Schaer suggested this week that the time has come for the return of mandatory home economics classes in the province’s public school curriculum.</p>
<p>Schaer came to be motivated for such a call after networking with Ontario farmers and sensing a skills deficit among their consumers that is affecting their bottom line. Knowing how to cook - really cook, not just heat something - appears to be an increasingl lost or underappreciated art. That’s bad news for farmers since they produce things to be used in food preparation. There are some things that are instant foods, in season. But their products would be much better appreciated if they had many consumers able and interested in adding value to their foodstuffs by aftermarket culinary efforts.</p>
<p>A related argument is the assertion that our child obesity problem is due in part to dietary ignorance of youth and their parents. Teaching the components of a healthy diet is one thing. Knowing how to deliver these elements to the plate with appeal is quite another.</p>
<p>Some cultivation of home economics skills in the cooking area would address this lack of knowledge. We don’t need a nation of Jamie Olivers - OK, Emily Richardses and Anita Stewarts. But if we moved in that direction through curriculum, it would also offer economic benefit for the individuals who became savvier about the world of food.</p>
<p>Home economics fell out of curriculum favour for being gender-stigmatized. It offered important life-skill content, however, and seems a baby ditched among its bath water.</p>
<p>We’re with Schaer and the farmers.</p>
<p>On another food note, we’re with Stewart as well today on the latest iteration of her World’s Longest Barbecue effort. It goes tonight - on grills across Canada and on Stewart’s in Elora.</p>
<p>It’s a boost to Canada’s food producers and is set for 5 p.m. and onward, local time - everywhere. The pork producers in particular could use the boost amid their H1N1 branding headaches. If you’re not able to enjoy pork or any other meat, Stewart sagely advises you’re still in the spirit if you’re celebrating local food tonight.</p>
<p>Bon appétit.</p>

</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>
<div>653 words</div><div>1 August 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba's fight against the H1N1 flu in the coming months will hit the provincial treasury with at least $50 million in extra costs.</p>
<p>Premier Gary Doer released the pandemic's projected price tag Friday as he warned that H1N1 will be "the dominant issue in Canada'' this autumn.</p>
<p>"We should prepare for another shoe to fall," Doer said in an interview, referring to a looming second wave of flu cases.</p>
<p>So far, seven Manitobans have died after testing positive for H1N1. According to the province's website, there have been 867 laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Doer expects H1N1 to be front and centre at next week's gathering of premiers and territorial leaders in Regina. It will also be on the agenda of a meeting between the premiers and aboriginal leaders in the Saskatchewan capital just prior to that event on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"To me, it's the most important discussion we will have," Doer said.</p>
<p>He said there is public uncertainty about what will happen next and there are "lots of challenges for both the federal and provincial governments on H1N1."</p>
<p>On the prevention side, Manitoba is making arrangements with Ottawa to acquire a vaccine once it's developed. The province will also step up education programs informing people how to guard against the flu.</p>
<p>"We're making decisions now on spending money on a vaccine that hasn't been discovered yet," Doer said. "Discussions are going on right now on how much will be purchased and what it will cost."</p>
<p>The province will also require anti-virals and other medications as the flu season hits.</p>
<p>It's anticipated there will be added stress on medical staff, particularly in intensive care units. The province has found that with this flu strain, patients require ventilators for longer periods than in past flu outbreaks.</p>
<p>"That puts pressure on the system." Doer said.</p>
<p>He said that although H1N1 may not be dominating the news as it was several weeks ago, there's been no lull in the province's planning and budgeting.</p>
<p>The premier said there will need to be considerable co-operation between Ottawa and the provinces in dealing with costs as well as how to cope with what he believes will be an "unpredictable" situation.</p>
<p>Asked whether he expected Ottawa to pick up some of the province's added costs in preventing and fighting an H1N1 outbreak, Doer said: "Our view is that we're partners. We're working together."</p>
<p>Also high on the premiers' agenda in Regina are economic and trade issues, he said.</p>
<p>The federal government has been lobbying for months to get the U.S. Congress to halt Buy American provisions from being tacked on to about US $290 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects as part of the Obama administration's stimulus package.</p>
<p>So far, Canadian companies complain they have been shut out of bidding for water treatment and school renovation projects financed by federal infrastructure spending, but the lion's share of the money has yet to be allotted.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce, along with other provincial chambers, urged the premiers and territorial leaders to work to protect Canadian businesses from U.S. protectionism. The chambers are also hoping for an enhanced economic partnership agreement with the European Union and the removal of interprovincial barriers to trade, investment and labour mobility.</p>
<p>Doer said Canadian provinces and municipalities must allow American companies to compete for work in their jurisdictions if Canadian businesses are to enjoy the same privileges down south.</p>
<p>The premiers have all agreed to that in principle, and now it's time to put it in writing, Doer said. "Everybody believes in free trade until it gets to the details," he said.</p>

<p>With flu season just around the corner, federal health authorities have issued new guidelines for front-line health workers to help contain and prevent the spread of H1N1, a second wave of which is expected in the fall.</p>
<p>The recommendations include measures such as removing toys and magazines from waiting rooms, screening for swine flu during 911 calls and keeping emergency patients in separate rooms if they show flu symptoms.</p>
<p>For hospitals with minimal space, waiting-room patients should be separated by at least two metres from other patients or workers who do not exhibit symptoms.</p>
<p>For long-term care facilities, residents should be screened when they move in and then monitored by staff for symptoms at least once a day.</p>
<p>The documents emphasize risk assessment and “source control” strategies as the most effective measures for preventing transmission of H1N1.</p>

<p>Canada's public health agency is shrugging off the tortoise-like pace at which the country's sole supplier will begin testing an H1N1 vaccine – a worrisome blasé attitude, given the severity of the virus.</p>
<p>In Australia, tests are already under way. In the United States, testing of a vaccine on adults and children will begin by mid-August. The European Union's top drug regulatory body is accelerating the vaccine's approval process, and countries such as Britain, Greece, France and Sweden say they will start using the vaccine as soon as it gets a green light – possibly within weeks.</p>
<p>But <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the company licensed to produce the vaccine in Canada, has said Canadian trials will begin in September or early October. Added to this slow pace are fears the vaccine is growing too slowly, and that once it is produced there will not be enough of it to go around. GSK has yet to announce how much is being produced at its Quebec facility.</p>
<p>Canada is also taking its time when it comes to deciding who gets treatment first: While the U.S. released its vaccine priority list on Wednesday, Canada doesn't plan to have its own until September.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief medical officer of health, seems unfazed. He has often told reporters that Canada will have the vaccine by November – enough of it to supply all Canadians who need it. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has said the extra time will give Canada more time to research the illness.</p>
<p>All well and good, if this were a garden-variety virus rather than a virulent, potentially mutative strain whose behaviour scientists and medical health officers are racing to track before the Northern Hemisphere's flu season begins in earnest.</p>
<p>The lack of urgency is not exclusively within federal jurisdiction: A scathing report released on Thursday by Nova Scotia Auditor-General Jacques Lapointe found the province's flu preparedness lacking – to the tune of a $5.8-million shortfall in vital supplies of gloves, masks and other medical equipment.</p>
<p>It is evident that many Canadians don't share their governments' sangfroid: A Globe and Mail-CTV poll found almost half of Canadians are concerned enough about vaccine supplies they think those who can pay for the vaccine should be first in line to get it.</p>
<p>Vaccine production and rollout are exacting procedures and should not be rushed, if to do so would eliminate necessary checks or safety measures. But Canada's tardiness and apparent nonchalance are seriously concerning and inexplicable.</p>
<p>A time lag in the rollout of the immunization program could have very serious consequences. A delay in Canada may mean Canadians will die needlessly. The race for a vaccine should be seen as exactly that: a race. And in the case of the deadly new flu, the tortoise doesn't win. It will just end up one seriously ill, or dead, reptile.</p>

<p>The number of swine flu deaths in Latin America -- the region with the highest fatality count from the disease -- rose above 600 on Friday as national governments updated tolls.</p>
<p>Authorities in Chile recorded the biggest jump, declaring eight more deaths since last week, taking their total to 87. The worst affected country in the region is Argentina, which has at least 165 confirmed deaths, according to an official tally given last week.</p>
<p>Local media said that count has since climbed considerably, to well over 200, making Argentina the country with the highest number of fatalities in the world after the United States, which has 302 deaths.</p>
<p>The southern hemisphere winter is partly blamed for the spread and virulence of the A(H1N1) pandemic in South America, home to 380 million people.</p>

<p>The end of the municipal strike spells good news for the city's battered tourism sector.</p>
<p>"Maybe summer can finally get started now," said Andrew Weir, the vice-president of Tourism Toronto.</p>
<p>The strike compounded a string of problems, including the rising Canadian dollar, the global downturn and U. S. border restrictions that had already left the industry struggling in the last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Weir said it's hard to measure the effect of the strike on tourism, but with major conferences coming to the city and events like Caribana ongoing, it was a relief to see it end.</p>
<p>"Anything that distracts from events like that does a disservice to the city and what it has to offer," he said.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, the Mayor took to the international airwaves on CNN to extol Toronto's virtues in the wake of a rash of negative publicity.</p>
<p>CNN's own report showed banks of dumped garbage and overstuffed litter bins, while the San Francisco Chronicle even put Toronto at the top of an illustrious list of avoidable destinations.</p>
<p>Toronto beat out a military coup in Honduras, the swine flu crisis in Mexico and a bubonic plague outbreak in Libya.</p>
<p>The problem now is getting the word out. It seems unlikely CNN's host Ali Velshi will be calling for a follow-up interview about the city cleanup, so making a good impression on those who do visit is now crucial. Mr. Weir highlighted the American Society of Association Executives who arrive on Aug. 15 for their annual convention.</p>
<p>"These are the people who make decisions about where their associations hold conventions. It's like the Super Bowl of conventions. This will be a live audition for Toronto," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>I used to donate to a local gym -- it's one way to "give back" and support the business community. Like so many people with good intentions to exercise at least three times a week and bond with some motivating workout buddies at one of the body-toning classes, I thought those biweekly debits from my bank account would ensure my regular attendance. But, no, I had a gym bag full of excuses that kept me away. It's criminal to miss those Seinfeld classics on TV.</p>
<p>Now, I'm doing cardio, free weights and stretching at least three times a week, and feeling more toned and energized. My secret? I moved into a condo with a small but tidy and well-equipped gym that's two floors down from my unit. When I get home from work, I can throw on a T-shirt and sweats, have a snack and scoot downstairs in less than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It's not the fact that I'm paying for the gym maintenance via the condo fees that's made me a regular there, but the convenience and a welcoming and friendly atmosphere. I live in a smaller building, with eight floors and about 10 units per floor, so it's working up a sweat with my neighbours who happily mind their manners.</p>
<p>There is a sense of community and good etiquette that I haven't seen in commercial gyms, despite all the cheery greeters and professional trainers. At my little gym, people are diligent about wiping down the cardio and weight machines with the disinfecting wipes provided. While it's a first-come, first-choice system for the channel selection, the flat-screen TV is mounted so everyone has a good vantage point and people actually discuss what's on next.</p>
<p>Instead of a roomful of people bobbing their heads to their iPods in their own worlds, people like to smile and say hello, even offer to help you learn an exercise if you ask.</p>
<p>I met Carlos from the eighth floor when he was swinging a kettleball, a traditional Russian strongman weight-training technique that's back in vogue for working the entire body.</p>
<p>"I combine this with interval sprints on the treadmill," Carlos says. "I'm in and out of the gym in 40 minutes instead of spending an hour or more with cardio and weight machines."</p>
<p>He's the only man I've seen sling his foot on the ballet barre in front of the mirror to stretch his leg. I'm the only person I've seen gyrating the hula hoop, but I admit that I tried it during a private moment when no one else was there. Several of us use the skipping rope, so there's lots of opportunity to mix up the heart rate-raising routine for better results, as the experts suggest.</p>
<p>There's also the social aspect I look forward to. Another woman and I have watched some important television while striding side-by-side on the elliptical trainers: This season's Bachelorette featured a Canadian from Vancouver who found her love match.</p>
<p>If I'm early enough on a Saturday, the weekend cleaner loves to practise her English skills with me as she finishes the dusting -- she was an accountant in Albania before coming to Canada with her husband.</p>
<p>Does concern over swine flu, the H1N1 influenza virus, change any of this camaraderie? Wouldn't sweating on communal exercise equipment be a cause for concern for contracting the virus?</p>
<p>It hasn't stopped anyone yet, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>"One should always be aware that there are infectious agents such as influenza, norovirus and the so-called super bugs," says Dr. John Embil, director of the Infection Prevention and Control Unit at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg. "But we must not become 'germ phobes' and restrict contact with others and limit our social activities."</p>
<p>The best prevention is handwashing as soon as you're back at home. At the gym, he recommends using the disinfecting wipes before and after using the equipment. If you have to cough or sneeze, do it into the crook of your arm, so that saliva and other debris are trapped.</p>
<p>"Influenza is spread by respiratory droplets," Dr. Embil explains. "Just because someone jogging next to you has an infection does not mean that it will spread to you. If the jogger on the treadmill were to cough or sneeze and respiratory droplets were to fall on the handles, there is a possibility that another gym attendee could touch those droplets and inoculate themselves by touching their nose, eyes or mouth."</p>
<p>Again, he stresses, disinfect the equipment before you use it for good prevention.</p>
<p>That way, my neighbours and I can keep coming back for safe exercise, chitchat and all those feel-good endorphins my hard work deserves.</p>

<p>Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff is set to accuse the Harper government today of "lacking federal leadership" in swine flu pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>Ignatieff is scheduled to tour the community health centre in Barrie, Ont., which his representative said is "a model of local initiative" on preparedness for the H1N1 flu virus, a contrast to what the Liberals consider foot dragging by federal authorities.</p>
<p>"We've seen leadership in communities like Barrie; we've seen leadership in the U.S. where they are way ahead of us in terms of public communication and preparedness," said Jill Fairbrother.</p>
<p>She cited news on Wednesday that American health authorities have identified pregnant women and four other priority groups to be the first to receive the vaccine, while Canadian officials said they won't have and don't need a priority list until September.</p>
<p>Ignatieff will be accompanied by Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett, a Toronto MP and family doctor, who said there is such a "bureaucratic quagmire" at the Public Health Agency of Canada that she has yet to receive a reply to questions about federal pandemic plans she submitted in June.</p>
<p>Bennett recently wrote federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq on behalf of her party's parliamentary caucus to express concern "over your silence" on H1N1 preparedness. After a public briefing by the minister and top officials about the plans this week, Bennett now said she feels "a bit heartened" but remains concerned.</p>
<p>She said guidelines issued Thursday for several groups of health care workers -- such as ambulance drivers, emergency room receptionists and long-term care nurses -- are needlessly complicated and there should be a Coles Notes version showing how the rules differ from other flu situations.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>SuperEx drops price of admission, ride tickets; 121st edition more wild than ever, literally</b>
</div><div>Morgan Dunlop   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>432 words</div><div>31 July 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Lions and tigers and rollbacks, oh my!</p>
<p>The 121st incarnation of SuperEx is getting ready to invade Ottawa's Lansdowne Park with wild animals.</p>
<p>There will be shows on the endangered species of Ontario, birds of prey and an Xtreme Wild show that organizers expect to be extremely popular. The show will pair predators with their prey, featuring wolves, a tiger, lion, panther, and even a domestic cat.</p>
<p>Conservation facilitators will be on hand.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's going to be any violence," said spokesman Doug Hempstead. "It will be highly managed. These are professionals."</p>
<p>As for the rollbacks, all admission prices are $2 less than last year. General admission is now $10 for adults, $5 for children under 12, and free for children under two years old.</p>
<p>Ride-all-day passes are $36 and ride coupons will be $1.50 each or $30 for a strip of 22. Another money-saving draw: All the shows are free.</p>
<p>"The Jonas Brothers are going to be in town at the Scotiabank Place theatre," Hempstead said.</p>
<p>"But not everyone can afford to see them."</p>
<p>The biggest act will be Bedouin Soundclash, currently touring the U.S. with No Doubt. Other performers include Danny Fernandes -- who recently took home the MuchMusic Video Awards' Pop Video of the Year for his song Private Dancer -- country star Aaron Pritchett and classic-rockers Prism.</p>
<p>This year, SuperEx runs from Aug. 20-30, meaning it will overlap with the first week of school for the French board and wrap up a day before English-language schools start classes. Organizers say they aren't worried.</p>
<p>"All bets are off when it comes to the Ex," Hempstead said. "Good luck keeping your kids away."</p>
<p>Although organizers are mindful of the swine-flu pandemic, no special measures are being taken. As always, there will be Ottawa city health inspectors on-site each day from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. And just like last year, there will be hand sanitizer dispensers placed throughout the grounds.</p>
<p>With less than three weeks until the gates open, the SuperEx website is counting down the seconds, literally.</p>
<p>Workers have begun to prepare the grounds at Lansdowne Park, constructing gates and stages and spray painting marks on the ground where rides will sit. The trailers, tents and trucks won't appear until Aug. 17.</p>
<p>"That's when you're going to start to see a lot of activity down here," Hempstead said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health department plans special H1N1 clinics; Third Ottawan dies of swine flu; six clinics expected by this fall</b>
</div><div>Patrick Dare   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>518 words</div><div>31 July 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The City of Ottawa is planning to set up clinics in community centres this fall to deal with the spread of H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>Dr. Vera Etches, the city's associate medical officer of health, said the public health department is working out details such as hours of operation and how they will be run. About six of the clinics will be established across the city to deal with what is expected to be "a resurgence" of the flu in the fall.</p>
<p>The clinics will be in addition to treatment provided at doctors' offices, walk-in clinics and health centres.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Etches said that a third Ottawa person had died from H1N1, a 62-year-old man who had been hospitalized and was suffering from serious respiratory problems before he got the flu.</p>
<p>Etches said most cases of the flu being seen in Ottawa are reasonably mild and people are recovering without being hospitalized. As of Thursday there were only three patients with the swine flu in Ottawa hospitals.</p>
<p>The city is confirming 357 people with tested cases of H1N1 flu, 69 of whom have been hospitalized. Symptoms are fever and a cough or sore throat, which evolve into serious difficulty breathing in severe cases.</p>
<p>"Most people are recovering from H1N1 on their own," said Etches, describing the current situation as "relatively stable."</p>
<p>One of the key questions for severe cases is availability of ventilators, which help gravely ill patients breathe. Thomas Hayes, who is chairman of a committee of emergency planners from area health-care institutions, said Thursday that 256 working ventilators have been identified in Eastern Ontario so far, an additional 10 need to be repaired and there are 90 other similar devices that could be used to assist patients.</p>
<p>Hayes said the hospitals are developing protocols for either transferring machines or patients in the event of an outbreak of severe cases in one area.</p>
<p>Etches said that public health officials expect schools to operate as normal this fall but that families will be encouraged to keep ill children home and step up their hand-washing as a way to limit the spread of the virus. To monitor outbreaks, the public-health department is asking schools and day cares to report absentee rates greater than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>H1N1 flu vaccine will arrive at Ottawa in mid-November and all residents of the city will be able to get the vaccine, according to the department. Etches said experience shows only about half the population will get the vaccine shot despite the expected spread of the virus when the cold weather comes.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a difficult season," said Etches.</p>

</p>
<p>More than half of children taking the swine flu drug Tamiflu experience side-effects such as nausea and nightmares, research suggests.</p>
<p>Studies of children showed that 51 to 53 per cent had one or more side-effects from the medication, which is being given to everyone with swine flu symptoms in England.</p>
<p>Peter Holden, the British Medical Association's lead expert on swine flu, suggested Tamiflu was being overused and did not need to be offered to everyone with mild symptoms.</p>
<p>A total of 103 children took part in the study, of which 85 were given the drug as a precaution after a classmate received a diagnosis of swine flu. Of those, 45 experienced one or more side-effects.</p>
<p>The most common was nausea, followed by stomach pain or cramps and problems sleeping.</p>
<p>Almost one in five had a "neuropsychiatric side-effect," such as inability to think clearly, nightmares and "behaving strangely," according to the research, published in the health journal Euro Surveillance.</p>
<p>In Canada, federal health officials last week approved the use of the antiviral drug Tamiflu in children under age one, despite limited safety data, because of the risk that swine flu poses to infants.</p>
<p>Health officials in Japan have recommended against prescribing Tamiflu to teenagers over fears it causes a rise in "neuropsychiatric events."</p>
<p>The researchers said that clinical trials had shown that about 20 per cent of adults reported side-effects of either nausea or vomiting after taking Tamiflu."</p>

</p>
<p>Forget the wars in the Mideast and the nukes flying out of North Korea. Or even that pesky swine flu pandemic that's about to consume us. The real news is that Jillian chose Ed on this week's finale of The Bachelorette.</p>
<p>After a gruelling nine weeks and 10 episodes, in which she managed to date her way through 30 eligible men, Vancouver's Jillian Harris decided that Ed Swiderski was the perfect man for her. Now, based on a handful of exotic dates (paid for by ABC) and a $60,000 engagement ring (paid for by ABC), she's packing her bags and moving to Chicago to, as Dr. Laura would say, shack up with Ed.</p>
<p>Where are Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem when you need them?Heck, even a self-esteem counsellor could have helped this "feisty, perky brunette" find happiness without going through men (literally) by the ton.</p>
<p>The Bachelorette is promoted as a woman's ultimate romantic fantasy, giving her the full power to choose, while leaving the men sitting at home waiting for her to beckon.</p>
<p>But the real fantasy suggested by this scenario is one of women striving to be like men and holding the relationship power that is typically given to men. It's the ultimate feminist fantasy.</p>
<p>Ironically, it's the one fantasy that never comes true. This show still leaves the men holding all the cards.</p>
<p>Yes, Jillian had the power to do the choosing and dismissing. But in the end, she is the one left waiting --hoping--that the right man will come through with a marriage proposal. Her final four bachelors included one who couldn't commit to anything beyond the current episode, one who couldn't say the "L" word, one who "had to do what was right for Number One" and Ed--who left part way through the process because he decided it wasn't worth sacrificing his career, but returned after a change of heart.</p>
<p>Jillian's last words before Ed arrived on the scene with the ring were telling: "Ed better not [bleeping] disappoint me." So who really has the power?</p>
<p>The show is seemingly devised to objectify men by providing 30 alpha males who are all good looking, successful, have great hair, even better abs and not much in the personality department. It then sets up scenarios where the men can remove their shirts and show off their six-packs to the giddy and overwhelmed bachelorette.</p>
<p>But Jillian and her many bikinis are the real focus of the camera, and there is little doubt that it is her sexual objectification that is the key element of this show.</p>
<p>Jillian is also supposedly given the sexual power. She is the predator who gets to take the men for a test drive. In the final weeks, she has the option of inviting the final four up to "the fantasy suite." In TV time, she appears to sleep with the final three on three consecutive nights. That's before she sleeps with the final two on consecutive nights and all this while America and her parents (yuck!) watch. But does that really give her the sexual power?</p>
<p>No matter how hard the show tries to turn gender stereotypes upside down, the majority of male viewers will remain in awe of the Bachelor who sleeps with three women in three nights and consider the Bachelorette who sleeps with three men in three nights as, to put it politely, easy.</p>
<p>Now that's irony: The NHL disciplines a hockey player for publicly using the term "sloppy seconds," while The Bachelorette portrays it as a girl's romantic fantasy.</p>
<p>Finally, The Bachelorette sought to portray Jillian as a strong-minded career woman who knew what she wanted in a man. But the edits primarily showed her as a fickle, lovesick teenager, conflicted until the end over her heart's desires, and ready to toss aside her career and current life just for the chance to find a man. So much for Girl Power!</p>
<p>The show widely quoted/ ridiculed the love song Wes wrote for Jillian and its lyrics, "love don't come eaassssy." But the real theme for this show should be, "What's love got to do with it?"</p>
<p>This concept is the natural result for a society with a rapidly devolving respect for marriage. Once that's expendable, The Bachelorette only proves how easy it is to diminish the value of courtship and love.</p>

<p>The remains of Victoria Stafford have been returned to her family in Woodstock, who are planning a private funeral. Oxford community police Chief Rod Freeman says the remains were returned this week from the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto. A police officer located the remains in a wooded area in southwestern Ontario on July 19. The eight-year-old girl disappeared after leaving school April 8. Freeman says police are still combing the area where Tori's remains were found. Michael Rafferty, 28, and Terri-Lynne McClintic, 19, are charged with the kidnapping and murder of the little girl.</p>

<p>Endangered fish stocks</p>
<p>showing signs of recovery</p>
<p>Some fish stocks that were on the verge of collapse are showing signs of recovery due largely to intensive management practices, according to new research that suggests limits on overfishing are saving imperiled fisheries. The findings, being published Friday in the journal Science, blunt dire predictions made in a controversial paper in 2006 that warned of the complete collapse of commercial fish stocks around the globe if fisheries management didn't change. Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, co-wrote both the 2006 article and the new paper.</p>

<p>Appeals court reinstates lawsuit against province in death of teen</p>
<p>The Ontario Court of Appeal has reinstated a lawsuit against the province alleging negligence on the part of the air ambulance service. The claim was brought by the family of 17-year-old Patrick Heaslip, of Shelburne, Ont., who suffered a crushed chest, broken ribs and punctured lung in a tobogganing accident at a ski club north of Toronto in February 2005. An emergency room doctor in Alliston, Ont., called for an air ambulance but a dispatcher said it would be two hours before the helicopter would arrive, so Heaslip was placed in a land ambulance and died en route to Toronto.

<p>Grape farmers encourage</p>

<p>Consumers are being asked to buy "true" Ontario wine as they stock up for the holiday weekend - a move grape farmers and their supporters say will help give the industry a much-needed boost. Grape grower David Wiley says he has $500,000 worth of grapes on his vines that may not find a home because Ontario law allows wine to be labelled as "cellared in Canada" if it contains up to 70 per cent foreign grapes or grape product. He wants labelling at the LCBO to be more clear so people understand when they're really buying local product. Rick Smith of the group Environmental Defence says the province must to make some changes to wine regulations to help Ontario grape growers.</p>

<p>Alberta premier says deficit likely worse than projected</p>
<p>Despite glimmers of economic hope, Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach says the provincial deficit is likely to be worse than originally expected at the end of the current fiscal year. Stelmach acknowledges that the $7-billion forecasted shortfall will likely be even higher at the end of the year. He says "abnormally high levels" of natural gas in storage and low prices for the commodity are hurting the revenue stream into provincial coffers. The government had originally anticipated a deficit of $4.7 billion when it unveiled its budget in April. Stelmach says there will be an economic update on the first quarter results at the end of August. .</p>

<p>Swine flu preparations</p>

<p>Nova Scotia's auditor general says the province doesn't have an adequate stockpile of medical supplies to protect health-care workers and respond to the swine flu pandemic.</p>

<p>Liberals closing gap</p>
<p>in 2009 fundraising</p>
<p>For the first time in years, the federal Liberals are giving the Tories a run for their money when it comes to fundraising.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2009, Liberals pulled in $3.878 million - a whisker short of the $3.957 million raked in by the Conservatives. Overall this year, Liberals have amassed $5.7 million in donations, more than triple their take during the same period last year. The Conservatives have pulled in $8.3 million so far, down slightly from 2008.</p>
<p>Last year, the Tories raked in $21.2 million, more than triple the Liberals' $5.9 million.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Miller pushes hard to get deal through; Close vote expected at city council today as outside workers ratify controversial contract</b>

</p>
<p>Toronto Mayor David Miller was working the phones hard last night amid a chorus of criticism calling for councillors to vote down the city's new deal with its civic workers.</p>
<p>City council was to meet today to sign off on the new three-year contract with its two CUPE locals, which ratified the deal over the last two days.</p>
<p>Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 416, representing Toronto's 6,000 outside workers including garbage collectors, voted yesterday by "a healthy margin" to return to work early this morning and get the city cleaned up, although curbside garbage collection for Toronto residents won't begin until Tuesday.</p>
<p>Local 79, representing 24,000 inside workers, ratified the agreement Wednesday.</p>
<p>With a municipal election set for next year, the councillors face a tough balancing act.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the city gave in on the controversial sick bank. The agreement allows existing employees to continue to bank 18 sick days a year, and accumulate up to six months of unused sick time to be paid out when they leave or retire. Though the benefit is set to end for new hires, it has angered many residents, especially those who work in the private sector.</p>
<p>On the other hand, councillors know that voting down the agreement means prolonging the strike, which would also infuriate a public fed up with mounting garbage around the city.</p>
<p>It's expected to be a close vote, with 11 fiscally conservative councillors - the Responsible Government Group - saying they plan to oppose the contract over the sick bank provision, and a handful of councillors still undecided.</p>
<p>"The people of Toronto didn't expect this kind of deal. They expected the sick bank benefit to be gone," said councillor Case Ootes, one of the members of the group, which held a press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>The group, which says it has received hundreds of emails and phone calls from constituents urging them to reject the deal, wants the city to continue negotiating for a better deal with the unions. Ootes said if that means the strike continues, his group will take the heat for that.</p>
<p>"I don't think the public wanted the strike (to end) at any cost," Ootes said.</p>
<p>Battered by critics, Miller came out swinging yesterday, telling reporters they'll see a "new level of anger" from the public if the strike continues and services don't resume today.</p>
<p>"It's essential to this city that we get people back to work and resume our services," Miller said.</p>
<p>Launching a salvo at the Responsible Government Group, Miller used the example of the family that runs the Centreville amusement park for children at Centre Island, which has been closed because ferry service has been halted. The family's business, he said, provides summer jobs for students who need to pay their tuition.</p>
<p>"Those kids who want to pay for university, these guys (the 11 councillors) want to keep them out of work some more? Let's get serious. Members of council understand that, and that's the message I'm going to be delivering.</p>
<p>"I believe members of council will be responsible and vote for the settlement," Miller said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the mayor said yesterday Miller had sent a memo to councillors and was speaking to them on the phone in a bid to sell the deal.</p>
<p>Miller also attacked the group for behaving in a manner that was "beneath contempt." He said the group sullied the reputation of city staff by implying that the city's negotiating team stepped beyond their bounds by agreeing to the sick bank provision, a provision the city's employee and labour relations committee was told was going to be taken off the table.</p>
<p>Councillor Karen Stintz, a member of the fiscally conservative group, later said the members weren't attacking staff for the concession, but rather Miller himself.</p>
<p>Following last night's ratification vote, Local 416 union president Mark Ferguson said he has "every reason to believe" the deal will pass. Ferguson said he wasn't concerned that some city councillors have publicly apposed it.</p>
<p>"There is no reason to worry about ratification from our perspective," he said.</p>
<p>But he made it clear no garbage will be removed from transfer stations or temporary dump sites until city council approves the deal. If it goes through, Ferguson said he hopes to have temporary dump sites cleaned up by the end of Sunday.</p>
<p>"The strike from our perspective is now over," he said to thunderous cheers from 416 members. "It's up to city council to do their part."</p>
<p>How the votes will shake down at council today though is unclear.</p>
<p>Several councillors informally polled this week said they're waiting to see the agreement before making a decision.</p>
<p>Councillor Suzan Hall is one of several undecided.</p>
<p>"I have to see what's there (in the deal). But do we want the strike to go further?" she said. "I have not seen the details of this agreement and, I think in this case, the devil is in the details," said councillor Ron Moeser, another in the undecided camp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it appears Toronto's medical officer of health had grave public health concerns about the city's strike lasting beyond the end of the month, worries that would likely have convinced Ontario's chief medical health officer to recommend back to work legislation.</p>
<p>As the strike entered its sixth week, Toronto's medical officer of health Dr. David McKeown became increasingly concerned about the "cumulative effects" of the loss of the services caused by the fact public health workers were among those on the picket lines.</p>
<p>"By the end of the month, I was becoming quite concerned about the impact of the loss of health services," McKeown said last night.</p>
<p>McKeown was providing regular updates to Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King, who has the authority to recommend that the province end the strike for public health reasons.</p>
<p>King could not be reached for comment but McKeown said as Aug. 1 approached, he was becoming alarmed about the loss or reduction of key services such as home visits after high-risk births, sexual health counselling, food safety and restaurant inspections. He was also worried the critical "ramping up" needed to prepare for an anticipated second wave of H1N1 flu in the fall would be delayed.</p>
<p>Miller, who kept in constant contact with McKeown, said yesterday the shortage of public health workers "wasn't sustainable forever."</p>

<p>A Winnipeg family's frustration at being unable to airlift a critically ill son home from the United States was held up as a warning sign about Manitoba's ability to handle a looming flu pandemic.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for the province's health minister and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (WRHA) said the incident -- in which the family's insurance company was unable to find a hospital bed in Winnipeg for the man -- arose solely because of a communication breakdown between the insurer and local hospital officials.</p>
<p>Rodmond Huska, 21, died in a Denver hospital, far from his friends and most of his family, on June 24 as a result of complications that developed after being admitted with a urinary tract infection. He had been in a U.S. hospital for close to a month.</p>
<p>His parents had taken him to Las Vegas to celebrate his birthday. On the way back home, on May 26, the three were stranded in Denver after missing a connecting flight.</p>
<p>Late that night, Rodmond, who was born with spina bifida and had a lifetime of health problems, became ill and was rushed to hospital.</p>
<p>U.S. doctors managed to stabilize his condition by Friday, May 29, allowing him to travel, but the family's insurance company was unable to find him a bed in Winnipeg over the weekend.</p>
<p>By Monday, June 1, the window of opportunity had passed, and he was too ill to travel from that time onward.</p>
<p>"Rodmond, all he wanted to do was to come home," said his mother Cheryl, who wept as she told the story to reporters Thursday at a news conference the Manitoba Conservative opposition organized. She was the only family member able to be at Rodmond's side when he died.</p>
<p>Myrna Driedger, the Tory health critic, said the incident raises questions about Manitoba's hospital bed capacity and how prepared the province is for a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, the question is, 'Are we so full in our hospitals that we can't accept one more patient?' " Driedger said.</p>
<p>However, Jan Currie, a WRHA vice-president, said the city does not have a hospital bed shortage, which was demonstrated when the system adapted to accommodate a growing number of patients during the H1N1 flu outbreak in May and June.</p>
<p>"We expanded our capacity to meet the need, and we will continue to do that," she said.</p>
<p>Currie said the unfortunate incident came about because the insurance company was unable to contact the right people when seeking a hospital bed for Rodmond Huska. Although there was no bed for him at the Health Sciences Centre, there were beds elsewhere in the city hospital system that could have accommodated him on the last weekend in May, she said.</p>
<p>Currie admitted, however, that both sides share responsibility for the communication breakdown. "This is a case that just fell between the processes," she said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald was unavailable for comment Thursday, but her spokesman said the minister will meet with Cheryl Huska to discuss her concerns.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Assurances that Canada is prepared for an influenza pandemic were challenged yesterday, after Nova Scotia's Auditor-General released a report criticizing that province for having inadequate medical supplies to respond to a virus that could become deadlier this fall.</p>
<p>Though pandemic preparations are taking place in the province, Jacques Lapointe said there has been little urgency shown by officials in acquiring gloves, masks and other medical supplies to deal with an outbreak. The shortfall between current stockpiles and recommended levels is $5.8-million, the report found.</p>
<p>“It's a question of simply not prioritizing this particular need ahead of other things,” Mr. Lapointe said in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>“If they instill a sense of urgency … and actually act on it quickly, then I think there's time to be reasonably prepared.”</p>
<p>Among his 33 recommendations, Mr. Lapointe directed the government to fast-track funding to purchase medical supplies.</p>
<p>Across the country, provinces and territories are topping-up their stockpiles of supplies in the event that the H1N1 virus follows the same course as the Spanish flu, which arrived in a mild form in the spring of 1918 and then mutated into something more vicious when flu season returned in the fall of that year.</p>
<p>Yesterday's report served as a reminder that, despite all the rhetoric about being prepared for a pandemic, health officials are still working on securing supplies.</p>
<p>Mr. Lapointe fears that medical supplies may not be as readily available as they were prior to the pandemic. The report noted that Nova Scotia recently ordered one million protective masks for health-care workers and was told it would take 12 to 18 months to fill the order.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's Health Minister, Maureen MacDonald, said the province placed three separate orders for masks and other supplies. The first order should be in soon, and the remaining ones will be filled by October.</p>
<p>Ms. MacDonald said many of the report's recommendations had already been identified and health officials were working on them.</p>
<p>“The Auditor-General did recommend that we needed to do more to have a more robust strategic reserve than we currently have for a pandemic. We already knew this, and we already were working to address that,” she said.</p>
<p>Stockpiles of medical supplies vary from one province to the next. Ontario has committed to maintaining a four-week supply of protective equipment, and the province is topping up the last of its order. British Columbia has 26-weeks worth of respirator masks, gowns, gloves and other supplies. Health authorities in that province have also ordered additional masks to bring the stockpile to a 46-week supply.</p>
<p>Ms. MacDonald said it was reassuring to know that provinces can rely on the federal government's national emergency stockpile system in the event of a shortfall.</p>
<p>But, she added, “we really have adequate supplies for the needs of the people in the province today. We've had these orders in and they're starting to be filled and we're not anticipating at this time that we're going to run into a situation where we're not going to have supplies.”</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said that it has received inquiries, but no formal requests, from provinces and territories regarding supplies.</p>
<p>Canada's first cluster of H1N1 cases was at a school in Nova Scotia. The agency reported yesterday that 59 people across the country have died as a result of the virus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada still to determine H1N1 flu shot priority list; Immunization likely to begin in November</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick, with files from Mike De Souza </div>

<p>Pregnant women should be among the first people given the swine flu vaccine, American health officials recommended Wednesday, but Canadian health officials say they are holding off until at least September before finalizing any similar priority list.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said Wednesday that discussions around a priority list are ongoing and there is still time for decisions to be made.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to review what's happening in the southern hemisphere, what's happened through the outbreak here," Butler-Jones said at a news conference. "We have some time to consider that, we don't need to issue those today. But clearly those who are at greatest risk of severe disease, health care workers and others, are going to be earlier on in that process."</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advisory committee on immunization identified five priority groups it said should be given the vaccine first when supplies are limited. They include: pregnant women; people who live with or care for infants under six months of age; health care workers and emergency medical services personnel; children and young people between the ages of six months and 24 years; and non-elderly adults with underlying risk factors or medical conditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said the working group concluded that all five categories of people were equally important targets for getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>"They (members of the working group) said that in general, under most circumstances, we really ought to promote vaccines in all these five focus groups and that picking among them or prioritizing some before others would not benefit the public," said Schuchat during a U.S. news conference.</p>
<p>At least 45 pregnant women in Canada have been infected with the virus, said Butler-Jones, and nine of those cases were severe. Those numbers are still relatively low, he said, but there is definitely a higher risk for pregnant women of having a severe illness, and for that reason they will also be high on Canada's priority list when it is finalized, he said.</p>
<p>"Pregnant women, because of the risk, will be one of the groups that we would hope to immunize early on," he said.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the company contracted to make Canada's vaccine, is still on track with its timeline to begin clinical trials in October. If those are successful immunization would likely begin in November.</p>
<p>"We are discussing with the provinces and territories the size of the H1N1 vaccine order and hope to be in a position to place a firm order with GSK in the near future," said Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>Immunization will not be mandatory and not all Canadians are expected to want it, said Butler-Jones. Those who have already contracted the swine flu are expected to have immunity to it and will not be among those recommended to receive a vaccine, he added, which will also drive down the number ordered.</p>

</p>
<p>I cycled past a dead crow the other day and was hit by a powerful wave of nostalgia: Whatever happened to the eco-scares of yesteryear? Shouldn't we all be dead by now?</p>
<p>They used to be as reliable (and as hair-raising) as summer blockbusters at the local cineplex -- horrifying tales of invasive foreign species that were undermining native ecology and, in the worst cases, threatening human life. These alarming forecasts arrived every spring and, as far as I could tell, were largely spread by newspapers and television newscasts.</p>
<p>This year, nothing. Or hardly anything; another sign, perhaps, of the declining influence of print journalism. There is passing reference in a recent Globe and Mail story to a new "killer shrimp" -- the bloody red mysid, a tiny aquatic creature recently spotted in the Great Lakes, that is said to be "ravenous," and to "travel in packs." Alas, Googling the words "killer shrimp" mostly turns up recipes from California seafood joints.</p>
<p>As for dead crows, they were associated with the 1999 discovery of West Nile virus in New York City -- Africa, apparently, being an inexhaustible wellspring of gruesome diseases. The virus was actually spread by mosquitoes, not crows, and it killed hundreds of people in the United States at its peak in 2003.</p>
<p>There were victims in Canada, too, although fatalities have been declining markedly. Indeed, four of five people bitten by infected mosquitoes experience no symptoms at all, a factoid usually relegated to the scare story's fine print. (Not that I'm suggesting these imported illness don't cause tragedy, just that their impact is invariably oversold.)</p>
<p>There are still occasional cases of West Nile reported -- and, anywhere there are mosquitoes, lingering concerns. The specific culprit -- the Culex tarsalis mosquito -- prefers hot weather. "Often on a nice warm evening, just as you're finishing the soccer game, you notice mosquitoes biting your ankles -- that's often Culex tarsalis," Saskatchewan provincial entomologist Phil Curry explained. (An obvious precaution: Wear socks.)</p>
<p>My favourite eco-scare -- patient zero, perhaps, of the modern genre -- is killer bees. They were the product of a 1957 experiment gone wrong in Brazil, when 26 aggressive African queen bees escaped a research compound, mated with milder European bees, and began a relentless expansion north. En route, they swarmed Mexican farmhands, killed innocent pets and dominated headlines in the early '90s.</p>
<p>Since then, they have lost their sting -- stalled at the Louisiana border by cold winters, their reputation rehabilitated, somewhat, by selective breeding and a name-change. They are now called "Africanized bees" and lauded by beekeepers for their gentle nature. They are still creating a buzz, however, judging by the number of sports teams bearing the moniker Killer Bees.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes remains a cauldron of unwelcome visitors -- home, by some estimates, to at least 57 alien species. The most famous is the zebra mussel, still cutting swimmers' feet, clogging pipes and temporarily disabling nuclear power plants around Lake Ontario.</p>
<p>Since 2006, freighters entering the Great Lakes have been required to flush their ballast, which is intended to slow or halt the introduction of non-native invaders -- although how any species can survive the industrial pollution in the Great Lakes is a scientific wonder in itself. Humans, after all, have done more damage than any hapless mollusk.</p>
<p>On land, the invasive purple loosestrife -- that vivid popsicle of colour waving brightly from every country ditch -- remains on the watch-list, despite the introduction of two leaf-eating beetles, a root-mining weevil and a seed weevil, intended to contain its spread. In Charlottetown, P.E.I., two women have been hired to dig up loosestrife along the city's Confederation Trail this summer.</p>
<p>The work is supported by the federal Invasive Alien Species Partnership, a program also helping Nova Scotia scientists and university students monitor the rugged coastline of Cape Breton. They are girding for a multi-pronged assault: Watching for European green crab, Asian shore crab, Chinese mitten crab, Japanese skeleton shrimp, lacy crust bryozan, sea squirts, oyster thief or dead man's fingers, spineycreek crayfish and rock snot.</p>
<p>Maybe the media have exhausted the annual allotment of alarming headlines on the swine flu -- now menacing summer camps, faithful to any Hollywood script -- and the recession. But you'd think dead man's fingers would at least warrant a mention.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stomp firms in receivership; Companies hit hard by depressed hog market; millions owed to creditors</b>
</div><div>Joanne Paulson </div>

</p>
<p>Stomp Pork's main inventory has been sold off, in the wake of depressed hog prices, a high Canadian dollar and the effects of a virus characterized as swine flu in the media, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Two Stomp companies, <span class="companylink">Stomp Pork Farm Ltd</span>. and Stomp Pork Farm USA Inc., went into receivership earlier this summer, owing millions of dollars to creditors including the <span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">Farm Credit Canada</span>.</p>
<p>The sale of Stomp inventory was approved by a judge in June. Earlier this month, a court order directed the receiver, Ernst & Young Inc., to pay the National Bank $2.7 million out of the proceeds of selling off Stomp pigs to G&D Pork of Sheldon, Iowa.</p>
<p>The receiver will take $77,434 for fees and disbursements, and pay other creditors as it sees fit.</p>
<p>But the companies owed the National Bank $14.5 million, plus interest and legal costs, according to documents filed in Saskatoon Court of Queen's Bench. National Bank proceeded with a receivership application when it became apparent that Stomp would be unable to feed its stock.</p>
<p>Receivership documents show <span class="companylink">Farm Credit Canada</span> is also owed $18.6 million, and an agent for an asset pool mortgage is owed $7.8 million. There are at least four other creditors, who are owed unknown amounts.</p>
<p>The Stomp companies had about $400,000 on hand, but required $250,000 for employee payroll and $80,000 to pay Cargill for feed deliveries to Canadian operations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Stomp USA arm owed Deluxe Feeds of Sheldon, Iowa, $1.2 million US for feed and $400,000 US for a margin loss on a corn and soybean hedging contract. Stomp sent its weanling pigs to the United States for finishing, or grown to slaughter weight.</p>
<p>Stomp USA pigs would consume about $425,000 to $450,000 worth of feed in one week. Other looming bills included barn rent to 50 U.S. contract grower barns, where Stomp had 130,000 pigs. Two barns were in South Dakota, one was in Minnesota and 47 were in Iowa.</p>
<p>"National Bank is gravely concerned that the debtors are on the brink of financial collapse and will, without the support and intervention of insolvency professionals, very quickly be placed in a position where they are unable to provide feed and care for the pigs owned by them," says the application.</p>
<p>The receiver dealt with the inventory, but not the land and building holdings of <span class="companylink">Stomp Pork Farm</span> and Stomp USA.</p>
<p>Two other Stomp companies were not part of the receivership proceedings: <span class="companylink">Stomp Pork Farm</span> 2008 and Titan Ventures.</p>
<p>Stomp Pork is owned by Ivan Stomp, who operated hog barns across Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>The downward path began in March 2008, when Stomp Pork Farms Ltd. originally filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>Pork producers are losing money on every animal sold, in a market damaged by country of origin labelling (COOL) laws in the United States, high feed prices, a strong Canadian dollar and the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Neither Stomp nor the company's lawyer, who is away, could be reached for comment.</p>

<div>Issues & Ideas</div>
<div id="hd"><b>On being a flu vaccine guinea pig; It is not easy being pregnant and having to decide whether to take the H1N1 vaccine</b>
</div><div>Kate Heartfield </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>909 words</div><div>30 July 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>Every time I see an assurance from health authorities that the H1N1 vaccine will be available in a few months, I develop a little knot of dread in the pit of my stomach. I have a big, scary decision to make soon.</p>
<p>I'm pregnant; the baby's due in January. That puts me in one of the high-risk categories for H1N1, and it also puts me on the priority list for the vaccine when it comes.</p>
<p>There are excellent reasons to roll up my sleeve and take the shot. H1N1 is a known, serious risk to pregnant women; many have already fallen ill and died.</p>
<p>My immune system was strong before I became pregnant and I have no respiratory problems, but I know (believe me, I know) that pregnancy changes everything. I can't trust this body to act predictably anymore, not for the next six months anyway.</p>
<p>The trouble is, I also have trouble trusting what medical authorities tell me.</p>
<p>It's not that I have some irrational fear of medical science in general. Medical science is great. I just returned from a visit to my new family doctor, and I couldn't be happier to have one after searching for five years. I am grateful to live in a country that doesn't have an epidemic of polio or diphtheria, and I know I can thank vaccines for that. Vaccines are up there with porcelain and the printing press on the list of wonderful, civilization-advancing inventions.</p>
<p>But the thing about vaccines -- and with all medical interventions -- is that every one requires an analysis of risk. In most cases, the risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine is known and is much lower than the risk of not getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>As one of the priority groups for a new vaccine, though, I'll be a guinea pig, and so will my fetus. I'll need to trust that the medical authorities, who are rushing to get this vaccine into production, have conducted enough research to be sure that the risk from the vaccine is lower than the risk of contracting H1N1 and suffering major complications.</p>
<p>That means I need to put my faith in people with more expertise than I have -- people under tremendous pressure to prevent a public-health disaster -- to make this calculation. That means I need to ignore that little voice in my head that can't forget about all the times the experts have been wrong.</p>
<p>To this day, there's no official tally of how many people the 1976 swine-flu vaccine killed. Estimates peg it at 25. Only one person died from the flu itself. It's sobering to watch those public service announcements from 1976 and realize that the tone of absolute certainty was a front. Doctors like to appear certain, even when they're not.</p>
<p>As a case in point, the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends the use of the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir for pregnant women who contract H1N1, stating baldly, "Both drugs are effective in treating the H1N1 virus, and both are safe for pregnant women."</p>
<p>But the Centres for Disease Control -- while no less eager to recommend the drugs -- acknowledge that "no clinical studies have been conducted to assess the safety of these medications for pregnant women." They suggest that, "Because of the unknown effects of influenza antiviral drugs on pregnant women and their fetuses, oseltamivir and zanamivir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus."</p>
<p>How is it possible to know whether one risk out-weighs the other, when the size of one of the risks is "unknown?" Granted, no one seems to have collected any data showing adverse reactions in pregnant women from these drugs, but I'm not eager to give my fetus drugs based on absence of evidence, especially when I consider the track record the medical system has when it comes to pregnancy. Throughout the 20th century, the norm was prescribe first, study later.</p>
<p>There is a long history of doctors telling women: trust us. Trust us, you need to be etherized. Trust us, you need an episiotomy. Trust us, you need to be induced. Trust us, you need a C-section. Trust us, you need a hysterectomy. Trust us, diethylstilbestrol prevents miscarriages. (It doesn't, and gives women and their babies cancer.) Trust us, thalidomide cures morning sickness (and causes severe birth defects.)</p>
<p>So when my doctor or midwife asks me this fall whether I want the H1N1 vaccine, what will I answer?</p>
<p>Do I take it, knowing the risk of H1N1 is serious and hoping the risk from the vaccine isn't? Maybe. All I know at this point is that it's not going to be an easy decision. That doesn't make me anti-science or anti-reason. It makes me, I hope, a good mother.</p>
<p>Photo: Mark van Manen, Vancouver Sun files / Development of
a vaccine to fend off the H1N1 virus is going ahead at a rapid pace,
but in the rush to get the vaccine out in time for the fall flu
season, are enough precautions being taken to ensure it is safe?

<p>Stomp Pork's main inventory has been sold off in the wake of depressed hog prices, a high Canadian dollar, and the effects of a virus characterized as swine flu in the media, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Two Stomp companies, <span class="companylink">Stomp Pork Farm Ltd</span>. and Stomp Pork Farm USA Inc., went into receivership earlier this summer, owing millions of dollars to creditors including the <span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">Farm Credit Canada</span>.</p>
<p>The sale of Stomp inventory was approved by a judge in June. Earlier this month, a court order directed the receiver, Ernst & Young Inc., to pay the National Bank $2.7 million out of the proceeds of selling off Stomp pigs to G&D Pork of Sheldon, Iowa.</p>
<p>The receiver will take $77,434 for fees and disbursements, and pay other creditors as it sees fit.</p>
<p>But the companies owed the National Bank $14.5 million, plus interest and legal costs, according to documents filed in Saskatoon Court of Queen's Bench. National Bank proceeded with a receivership application when it became apparent that Stomp would be unable to feed its stock.</p>
<p>Receivership documents show <span class="companylink">Farm Credit Canada</span> is also owed $18.6 million, and an agent for an asset pool mortgage is owed $7.8 million. There are at least four other creditors, who are owed unknown amounts.</p>

<p>It is important to provide First Nations communities with accurate information about the H1N1 flu, says the tribal vice-chairman of File Hills Qu'Appelle Tribal Council.</p>
<p>"There are many different inconsistencies on who can get it, how they get it and why they get it," Myke Agecoutay said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The File Hills Qu'Appelle Tribal Council hosted a forum on the H1N1 virus on Wednesday to help dispel some myths about the disease and provide First Nations communities with accurate information.</p>
<p>"We wanted to dispel many of those inaccuracies and provide a forum for our First Nations communities to hear first-hand from the professionals within the provincial government (and the federal government)," Agecoutay added.</p>
<p>Anna Crowe from the Piapot First Nation believes that First Nations communities can prevent the disease from reaching epidemic levels on reserves if steps are taken now to address the situation. She attended the forum so that she can get accurate information about the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"We need to have that first-hand information. We need to be ready for the fall. We need to start putting the plans in place and we need to not only assist ourselves but our families (and) our community members to be prepared," said Crowe.</p>
<p>The FHQTC represents 11 First Nations and arranged for each community to send three representatives. However by the start of the conference, more people than the expected number had arrived at the event.</p>
<p>Agecoutay said the All Nations Healing Hospital in Fort Qu'Appelle has been fielding calls about the virus from concerned communities so it was decided that an information forum was needed.</p>
<p>"(Wednesday's) session allows us to interact. It allows community members, health professionals within our communities to ask the questions directly to those professionals who know what's happening and what those facts are and how do we move forward."</p>
<p>Agecoutay said that as a First Nations leader, he's concerned about how this disease is affecting First Nations people. He hopes other First Nations and tribal councils will host similar forums so that everyone is prepared.</p>
<p>"We had an overwhelming response from different territories that are not part of our tribal council. We don't have the resources to bring everyone together to accommodate such a mass forum," said Agecoutay. "In Saskatchewan, there are well over 800 cases and over 120, I believe, are First Nations individuals. One of the three deaths is confirmed to be of a First Nation person."</p>
<p>He said those statistics are alarming and was hoping some of the health professionals in attendance would be able to answer all his questions.</p>
<p>Dr. Saqib Shahab, deputy chief medical health officer for the Ministry of Health was on hand to help answer some questions about the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Shahab said following the disease since it began surfacing in April has been helpful. He believes that it's important to begin planning for the next wave of the virus, which he expects may occur in the fall.</p>

</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>466 words</div><div>30 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Pregnant women should be among the first people given the swine flu vaccine, U.S. health officials recommended yesterday, but Canadian health officials say they are holding off until at least September before finalizing any similar priority list.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said yesterday that discussions around a priority list are ongoing and there is still time for decisions to be made.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to review what's happening in the southern hemisphere, what's happened through the outbreak here," Butler-Jones said at a news conference. "We have some time to consider that, we don't need to issue those today. But clearly those who are at greatest risk of severe disease, health-care workers and others, are going to be earlier on in that process."</p>
<p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's advisory committee on immunization identified five priority groups it said should be given the vaccine first when supplies are limited.</p>
<p>They include: pregnant women; people who live with or care for infants under six months of age; health-care workers and emergency medical services personnel; children and young people between the ages of six months and 24 years; and non-elderly adults with underlying risk factors or medical conditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said the working group concluded that all five categories of people were equally important targets for getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>"They (members of the working group) said that in general, under most circumstances, we really ought to promote vaccines in all these five focus groups and that picking among them or prioritizing some before others would not benefit the public," Schuchat said during a news conference.</p>
<p>At least 45 pregnant women in Canada have been infected with the virus, Butler-Jones said, and nine of those cases were severe.</p>
<p>Those numbers are still relatively low, he said, but there is definitely a higher risk for pregnant women of having a severe illness, and for that reason they will also be high on Canada's priority list when it is finalized, he said.</p>
<p>The chief health officer said authorities are gathering as much data as possible before choosing who will get the vaccine in the first week of the immunization program vs. later on, and likely won't make final decisions until early or mid-September.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the company contracted to make Canada's vaccine, is still on track with its timeline to begin clinical trials in October. If those are successful immunization would likely begin in November.</p>

</p>
<p>There's the real world and Bizarro World, there's matter and antimatter, and then there's Sarah Palin and Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Both the would-be vice-president and the actual one have a history of making foolish off-the-cuff remarks, and each has a knack for unnecessarily infuriating the opposition -- they just do it from opposite sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>And if Palin scores political points by stretching the truth, Biden loses headway by being honest.</p>
<p>A case in point: his appallingly ill-advised statements last weekend about Russia.</p>
<p>"The reality is, the Russians are where they are," Biden said, in comments published Saturday.</p>
<p>"They have a shrinking population base, they have a withering economy, they have a banking sector and structure that is not likely to be able to withstand the next 15 years, they're in a situation where the world is changing before them and they're clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable."</p>
<p>Biden was just calling it as he sees it on Russia, but to upend the contents of his brainpan in front of a Wall Street Journal reporter, on the heels of a diplomatic initiative by the Obama administration that sent both President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to Moscow bearing "reset buttons" and promises to open a new era of mutual respect and improved relations, was immensely counterproductive.</p>
<p>The Kremlin sent a bristling response questioning whether the president or the vice-president was shaping U.S. foreign policy goals, and Clinton tried to smooth things over by calling Russia a "great power" in an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press. But the damage was done.</p>
<p>As one Russian newspaper reported: "Joe Biden unexpectedly returned to the rhetoric of the previous Bush administration."</p>
<p>Obama surely knew when he chose Biden as his running mate that he was getting a loose cannon. So he can't possibly be surprised when his vice-president shoots the occasional 16-pound ball through his policy agenda, such as the time in April when Biden advised people to avoid flying or riding subways so as not to contract swine flu, even as the rest of the administration was trying to reassure jittery Americans about the much-hyped flu bug and head off a transportation meltdown.</p>
<p>And who can forget Obama's withering glance when Biden made sport of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. for mucking up the presidential oath at precisely the same moment that Obama was pleading for bipartisanship and mutual respect in Washington?</p>
<p>Yet Obama's principal rationale for choosing Biden was that the former senator's foreign policy expertise would make up for his own lack of diplomatic experience.</p>
<p>This can't be what the president had in mind.</p>

<p>H1N1 flu</p>
<p>I do not understand why some people continue to refer to the H1N1 flu as the swine flu, most notably those that work in the media. It was mentioned three times during a recent six o’clock television newscast and again on the 11:30 p.m. newscast.</p>
<p>Was it not precisely this negative label that had repercussions for the pork industry and subsequent financial losses at the onset of this flu outbreak due to public ignorance?</p>
<p>Someone should address this persistent practice by the news writers, editors and broadcasters alike to alleviate further unnecessary damage and quell public fear.</p>

<p><span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean Cruises</span> shares fell the most in a month after the world's second-largest cruise operator reduced its full-year earnings forecast and said swine flu disrupted business more than anticipated.</p>
<p>Earnings will fall as low as 70 cents (U.S.) a share, from $2.68 in 2008, the Miami-based company said yesterday. In April, it forecast $1.35. The latest estimate assumes the impact of the H1N1 virus will reduce earnings by 27 cents a share, the company said.</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean fell $1.54, or 9 per cent, to $14.85 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after dropping as low as $14.64, the biggest decline since June 22. The shares had gained 19 per cent this year before yesterday.</p>
<p>"The economy continues to be a challenge and the impact from the publicity surrounding H1N1 has been very frustrating," CEO Richard Fain said.</p>
<p>The second-quarter net loss was $35.1 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with a profit of $84.7 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Analysts projected a loss of 13 cents, excluding some expenses.</p>
<p>Revenue fell 15 per cent to $1.35 billion, missing the $1.38 billion average projection of analysts.</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean cut ticket prices as consumers shopped for travel bargains and made vacation decisions later than usual. The operator of 38 cruise ships trimmed costs and benefited from falling fuel costs.</p>

<p>SCIENCE REPORTER</p>
<p>Eleanor Fish thinks interferon, a drug usually used to treat people with cancer, might help patients with serious cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>The immunologist at the University Health Network in Toronto has preliminary data that suggest the synthetic version of a compound produced by the human immune system might be an effective treatment for swine flu. But she is having trouble securing the money to test it.</p>
<p>“Finding the funds to demonstrate safety and efficacy in patients is a tremendous challenge – remarkable given the concerns about an H1N1 pandemic,” she said. “But I am determined to pursue this.”</p>
<p>Other Canadian researchers also have urgent questions about H1N1. Are people with acute or chronic infections, like latent tuberculosis or parasites, more at risk of being hospitalized or dying from it? Is vulnerability linked to specific genes?</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest question is whether they can design experiments, get the ethical approvals and find the funding quickly enough to make a difference in this pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Fish is one of many Canadian scientists forming teams to apply for grants from a $1.2-million fund to study H1N1 that the Canadian Institutes of Health Research is offering. The deadline is Aug 10, but the funds aren't expected until October.</p>
<p>Flu season will be well under way by then, Dr. Fish said. “It is very obvious where attention needs to be focused right now – treatment and patient care. There are individuals in the scientific community who are acutely aware of the urgency of the situation and frustrated at the lack of resources directed at one specific area: antivirals.”</p>
<p>She said considerable attention and funding has rightly gone into research on infection control in the community and health-care facilities, research of the transmission of the virus and work on a vaccine.</p>
<p>But it is unlikely a vaccine will be available before flu season, she said, when many more Canadians could become infected. It is also unclear whether there will be enough.</p>
<p>So short-term treatment must focus on antivirals, she said. The virus is already becoming resistant to Tamiflu, one of two antivirals that can keep it in check if taken within days of the first symptoms. That leaves only Relenza, which must be inhaled, making it less useful for patients with lung problems.</p>
<p>Dr. Fish and collaborators are proposing to evaluate several antivirals, including interferon, for treating H1N1, to study lung injury during infection, and the flu's effect on a person who already has a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>The $1.2-million is meant to bring together large teams of researchers, but it is not adequate, she said. It also is not intended for clinical trials, so Dr. Fish will have to look elsewhere for money to study interferon as a treatment.</p>
<p>Interferons are produced by the immune system to combat viruses, but doctors using synthetic versions during the SARS outbreak in 2003 worried they would increase inflammation in the lungs of patients with severe cases.</p>
<p>As other approaches failed, Dr. Fish and colleagues did a small pilot study on 19 patients that had promising results, but the outbreak ended before they could follow up.</p>
<p>Lab work shows interferon might be effective against H1N1, but studies involving seriously ill patients are needed.</p>
<p>Bhagirath Singh, scientific director of the CIHR's Institute of Infection and Immunity, said he understands the urgency, with flu season only six to eight weeks away.</p>
<p>Dr. Singh said he is hoping for more money from the government and will try to speed up the approvals process so the $1.2-million starts to flow before the fall.</p>
<p>But he said the Canadian research community is far more prepared to work on influenza today than it was in 2006, when concerns over avian flu prompted the federal government to start investing in pandemic research.</p>
<p>At the time, only four teams in the country were working on influenza, he said, but since then, the CIHR has spent $39-million on pandemic research through 71 different proposals.</p>
<p>Work on H1N1 that has already been funded includes a network focused on evaluating vaccines and a project to track the evolution of the virus and evaluate its susceptibility to antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>“There is money out there. There is investment. Do we need more money? Absolutely,” Dr. Singh said.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>FLU Q&A</p>
<p>Why do some otherwise healthy people get seriously ill or die from H1N1?</p>
<p>At the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Dat Tran is investigating whether particular genes are associated with a severe response to the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>A 2008 study of Utah residents who had died of influenza over the past 100 years found that their relatives – both close and distant – also had an increased risk of dying from the flu.</p>
<p>This suggests that genetics is a factor. To zero in on which genes may be involved, Dr. Tran has taken DNA samples from 200 children with the seasonal flu and 100 who had H1N1.</p>
<p>He would like to have 1,000 participants in the study to see whether he can find genetic differences between those with severe flu symptoms and those with mild ones. He is also still talking to collaborators about which genes to focus on.</p>
<p>Will he get any answers before the fall flu season?</p>
<p>“I never say never.”</p>
<p>But genetics are likely only part of the explanation for why some healthy people are more vulnerable than others.</p>
<p>Research involving two remote native communities in Northern Ontario that began well before the H1N1 pandemic could provide insight into environmental factors.</p>
<p>Lionel Filion, an immunologist at the University of Ottawa, has a hunch that people whose immune systems are already fired up to fight an acute or chronic infection may be more vulnerable to H1N1.</p>
<p>Three years ago, he and several colleagues set out to study whether chronic diseases in the two communities were linked to environmental pollutants or disease-causing microbes in the food or water. Ninety volunteers provided blood samples, and local food and water samples are also being analyzed. He is hoping to follow up with the blood donors and find out whether those who had a chronic infection – such as latent tuberculosis – had more severe symptoms if they had the flu.</p>
<p>New blood samples would show whether people with acute infections – with the intestinal bug giardia for example – were also more vulnerable, said Dr. Filion's colleague, Jason Tetro of the Centre for Research on Environmental Microbiology at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>“There may be contributing factors that lead to an increased susceptibility to H1N1. What are those factors? Can we find them in time to prevent widespread mortality?”</p>
<p>Dr. Filion needs to secure permission from the two communities to expand the research and to get the necessary ethical approvals and funding. He doesn't think it will all come together before the fall flu season.</p>

</p>
<p>After a break-neck spring ferrying H1N1 victims from northern Manitoba to Winnipeg for treatment, Manitoba's medevac players are gearing up for an autumn flying season that could be even busier.</p>
<p>Manitoba's Health Department said it's too early to predict the extent of the virus's reach in the short term but it's preparing for a second wave of H1N1 in the fall.</p>
<p>"We expect we need to be prepared for something more intense than we saw in the spring," said Jean Cox, the department's executive director of rural and northern regional support.</p>
<p>As of last week, more than 850 Manitobans had been diagnosed with the disease, including seven who died.The predictions have the province's four medevac carriers making sure they have the staff and aircraft ready for takeoff should even modest pandemic forecasts become reality.</p>
<p>Fast Air Medevac added a third King Air 200 to its dedicated air ambulance fleet in the spring and is prepared to add another if the demand calls for it.</p>
<p>"A fourth plane is coming, it's just a matter of timing. We could turn (the deal around) relatively quickly," said Tim Hague, director of air ambulance services for the Fast Air Limited subsidiary.</p>
<p>"Our numbers increased dramatically in the spring. We flew more missions in June than in any month in the six years we've been in (the medevac) business."</p>
<p>Hague said Fast Air Medevac called in extra staff in the spring to handle the unprecedented demand and has its people on alert in case the same scenario materializes this fall.</p>
<p>"We have an ongoing commitment to keep the aircraft in the air around the clock. It's a huge concern in Manitoba because our northern communities got hit so terribly hard. Our staffing levels have been really good. We've been fortunate nobody has been sick," he said.</p>
<p>SkyNorth Air Ltd. recently increased its fleet, bumping up its number of King Airs to three. Vice-President Greg Psooy said it is ramping up its staff and equipment to ensure it's ready if the calls come.</p>
<p>To improve the chances that its pilots and medical personnel remain healthy, he said in-flight staff wear face masks and protective gloves and the plane is scrubbed down with disinfectant after every trip.</p>
<p>Neither Perimeter Aviation nor Missinippi Air plan to add planes to their fleets but they're both prepared to use charter aircraft and employees into medevac service if the need arises.</p>
<p>Mark Wehrle, president of Perimeter, said it recently recruited a pair of nurses and three paramedic workers from outside Manitoba to ensure it will be able to fully staff its Metro II planes in the fall.</p>
<p>"The demand for nurses outside of air ambulance puts a strain on us. When they're not flying, they're working in a hospital or a nursing station. Having them available will be our biggest challenge. We're recruiting 12 months of the year," he said, noting Perimeter has five aircraft dedicated to medevac but can call upon another dozen should its capacity be reached.</p>
<p>Lena Thorne, chief flight nurse for The Pas-based Missinippi, said its two medevac planes can take five or six trips in a 24-hour period. It also has 10 other planes that could be assigned to medevac duty on short notice, she said.</p>
<p>geoff.kirbyson@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>The medevac market</p>
<p>THERE are 150,000 people in northern Manitoba who rely on air ambulances to get the health care they need. Here's how the province's four medevac providers are equipped to handle an expected surge in H1N1 this fall.</p>
<p>Fast Air Medevac: The Winnipeg-based carrier recently added a third King Air 200 to its medevac fleet and is planning to add a fourth.</p>
<p>Perimeter Aviation: The biggest regional carrier in the province has five Metro IIs providing medevac services but it can tap into another 12 planes if need be.</p>
<p>SkyNorth Air: The Winnipeg-based carrier has three King Air A100s providing air ambulance services.</p>
<p>Missinippi Airways: Based in The Pas, it has two King Air B200s dedicated to medevac but it can also use 10 other planes in its fleet if required.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tribal Journeys canoes a no-show; Songhees were planning big feast; chief calls for better organization</b>

<div>486 words</div><div>29 July 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>Everything was ready for a huge party on the Songhees First Nation reserve yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tables were set up outside the Big House, hundreds of coho fillets were cooking over an open alder fire, pieces of chicken sizzled on a giant barbecue and gallons of spaghetti sauce simmered over a propane stove.</p>
<p>All that was missing was the guests.</p>
<p>That has Songhees Chief Robert Sam calling for better organization of the Canadian section of the Tribal Journeys canoe voyage.</p>
<p>Canoes from all over B.C. and Washington will be converging on Suquamish, Wash., Monday to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tribal Journeys. But it's the stops along the way that are causing confusion.</p>
<p>Some canoes that were planning to stop at Songhees instead chose the Tsawwassen and Lummi route because of swine flu outbreaks on Vancouver Island reserves, while others from the west coast of the Island spent the night in Beecher Bay.</p>
<p>"We've got to start working together," said Sam. "Something has got to be done."</p>
<p>The band spent about $4,000 on food, but only a handful of canoes were scheduled to turn up late yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The food is unlikely to be wasted as band members and those living off-reserve are looking forward to a feast and any leftovers will go to charity.</p>
<p>In the future, Sam also wants Tribal Journeys to be used to raise money for causes such as diabetes or cancer research, instead of being simply a cultural get-together.</p>
<p>That's something that gets enthusiastic support from Bill Smith, whose family held a loonie/toonie auction at the Tribal Journeys dinner to raise money for treatment for his brother, Joe Smith, who suffers from a rare type of cancer.</p>
<p>"When the canoes come in, we should be talking about things like the many diseases in our community, like high blood pressure, sugar diabetes and different sorts of cancer," he said.</p>
<p>A delegation from the host Suquamish Tribe, headquartered on a barge moored at Songhees, was hoping to escort a flotilla of canoes across Juan de Fuca Strait this morning.</p>
<p>It is "kind of disappointing" there will not be as many canoes as anticipated, said council member Bob Alexander.</p>
<p>However, more than 100 canoes, each holding between five and 10 people, are expected in Suquamish next week and the tribe has spent four years preparing for the get-together, he said. "We have a brand new longhouse and we've built a major league baseball field for the campers."</p>
<p>Suquamish travelling elder Jim Pratt said Tribal Journeys is a way to re-establish lost culture.</p>
<p>The canoes will be escorted across Juan de Fuca Strait starting at 6 a.m. by the Canadian Forces training vessel PCT Moose.</p>

<p>The Harper government says it will release new guidelines this week as part of its flu pandemic strategy to protect Canadian workers who deliver critical services, such as paramedics, ambulance attendants, police and firefighters.</p>
<p>Another set of guidelines for public transit workers will be available in August, a representative of Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>These moves come in the wake of a critical letter sent by Canadian municipalities, urging the health minister to show more leadership to protect municipal workers responsible for providing critical services, such as public safety, public transit and water treatment in the face of the H1N1 swine flu virus.</p>
<p>"If you don't have a plan that ensures that those folks have their needs met, in terms of anti-virals and vaccinations and so on, a serious disruption could occur in critical services, and that would then put Canada's pandemic-response plan on life support, in a sense," said Berry Vrbanovic, a city councillor in Kitchener, Ont., and second vice-president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.</p>
<p>Safe drinking water and waste-water treatment, for example, depend on municipal workers being healthy enough to get to their jobs at facilities, Vrbanovic said. Public transit operators are also essential in helping doctors, nurses and public health-care workers get to work in large urban centres, he added.</p>
<p>The government says it's also working on a "Vaccine Prioritization Framework" to protect Canadians from the virus, but it must still consult with provinces and public health officials.</p>
<p>"It is undergoing the careful and thorough review that is necessary to ensure that all relevant factors are considered in this important document," said Aglukkaq's representative Josee Bellemare. "The Government of Canada is working with provincial and territorial officials to develop an approach on how best to deliver vaccines to all Canadians who wish to be inoculated."</p>
<p>The SARS outbreak, which mainly affected Toronto in 2003, cost the economy up to $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>"The basis of a solid pandemic plan is to ensure that both your health-care workers and your other municipal frontline workers provide the basic services that are necessary to keep our communities running, and that our economy can operate as effectively as possible," he said.</p>
<p>He said the federation welcomes new federal government guidelines and efforts to coordinate a national response with provincial health ministers. But he said it's time to turn those guidelines into action before any serious outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally, once all this is done, I think it's necessary that any guidelines that do come out aren't simply filed and forgotten in Ottawa, but that they're put to work in communities from coast to coast to coast in this country, protecting Canadians where they live and work, whether it's one of our smallest communities or one of our largest cities."</p>

<p>As the H1N1 influenza pandemic makes headlines around the world, an increasing number of people with health anxiety are fearing the worst as they "self-diagnose."</p>
<p>Candice Bovell, a PhD student at the University of Regina, says it's normal for people to worry about their health from time to time, but some get trapped in a health-anxiety cycle.</p>
<p>"Health anxiety is when people experience symptoms or bodily sensations and they misinterpret that and think they have a serious disease or illness," she said.</p>
<p>"Their symptoms may get worse when they hear about pandemics on the news."</p>
<p>During the SARS crisis or, more recently, the H1N1 flu pandemic, Bovell knows of people who searched online for symptoms of the outbreak.</p>
<p>"They'll keep on looking for it in themselves and other people," she said. "During this time period, people who have health anxiety will have their symptoms act up. They will go to the doctor's (office) more and they'll find more things wrong with them. The Internet can really aggravate things."</p>
<p>For example, someone with a sore throat may <span class="companylink">Google</span> the symptom and self-diagnose throat cancer.</p>
<p>Worrying about illness can cause symptoms of anxiety such as sweating, a pounding heart, insomnia or breathlessness. The worrying can also cause a person to constantly check for changes in their condition. Their preoccupation with their health can be so extreme that they aggravate their symptoms, find new ones and start the cycle again.</p>
<p>Bovell is recruiting Reginans, 18 years and older, who are highly anxious about their health or fear they have a serious ailment to take part in a health anxiety study she's conducting. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups.</p>
<p>The first group will receive a self-help book called It's Not All in Your Head, written by Bovell's supervisor, Gordon Asmundson, and Steven Taylor. After participants read the book, they fill out online questionnaires.</p>
<p>Volunteers in the second group will read the book and then spend eight one-on-one sessions with a psychology graduate student at the U of R's anxiety and illness behaviour lab to discuss their reading and their health anxiety.</p>
<p>The third group's members will be placed on a wait list for two months and will complete online questionnaires at home. After eight weeks, they will receive the first group's treatment.</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy treatments are approved for health anxiety and numerous anxiety disorders such as depression.</p>
<p>"The core of cognitive behaviour therapy for health anxiety is to identify the person's thoughts that are distorted," Bovell said. "They'll talk about their symptoms and list them and we'll get them to recognize that they're over-reacting."</p>
<p>The study's goal is to determine which treatment is most effective.</p>
<p>"Is it better with a therapist or is it better alone -- is there any difference?" Bovell said. "This book is already available to people, but maybe it's more effective with a therapist. We're not sure."</p>
<p>She observed that health anxiety affects many people.</p>
<p>"It causes them to go to the doctor very often and it uses up health-care resources," she said. "Sometimes they don't get the help they need. It's frustrating for doctors and it's also very frustrating to the individual ... It causes stress in relationships as well because they're always talking about illnesses and there's never any answers or cures or treatments."</p>
<p>Bovell suggests people get a physical examination before applying to participate in the study.</p>
<p>More information is available online (www.aibl.ca[http://www.aibl.ca]). Those interested in applying for the free treatment can call lab at 337-2473.</p>

<p>With the recession hitting the United States harder than Canada, and the Canadian dollar strong, this may be a great time for Canadians to buy that sunny, tranquil getaway in the U. S. or farther south.</p>
<p>But to make sure it is tranquil, do your due diligence, just like you would at home.</p>
<p>Tom Kelly, a syndicated columnist based in Washington state, has co-authored two books about buying real estate in Mexico and Central America. He believes prices in those areas will go up once American baby boomers recover some of their wealth.</p>
<p>U. S. boomers weren't prepared for the economic downturn, and once they rebuild, they are going to look for a cheaper lifestyle. And it's definitely cheaper in Mexico and Central America, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Canadians, on the other hand, haven't been as hard hit and were better prepared, he said. So they are in a better position to buy now.</p>
<p>"And the farther you go, typically the less expensive it's going to be," Kelly said.</p>
<p>Panama, for example, "is a bargain right now," Kelly said. "But it costs money to get there."</p>
<p>And while Puerto Vallarta and other places in Mexico are easier to get to, deals can be found there too, because not as many people are buying, he said.</p>
<p>The outbreak of H1N1 flu in the spring turned some people off. And the rash of drug-related crime did too, Kelly said. But Kelly believes Mexico is perfectly safe, with the violence limited to the drug trade near the border. "There's no history of these people targeting non-nationals."</p>
<p>Mexico is also safe from a purchasing perspective with title insurance now available to those buying property, he said.</p>
<p>A lot of the horror stories of people buying in Mexico and ending up with nothing really stemmed from "non-nationals buying property they should have never bought in the first place because nobody owned the title to it," Kelly said.</p>
<p>So just like you would in Canada, "go out and do the due diligence" before you buy, he said. "Don't leave your brains at the border. Check out the property in person to make sure it's what you want, rather than buying off the Internet."</p>
<p>For financing, it's cheaper to remortgage your Canadian property and buy with cash than to get local financing. While there are international banks that will lend you money, they will charge more, he said.</p>
<p>David Ingram is a North-Vancouver-based former real estate agent who has made a career out of advising Canadians who want to buy property outside the country, and foreigners who want to buy property in Canada. About 6,000 people attended his seminars last year, an indication of the interest in offshore real estate, Ingram said.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is, every country, and every state, is different, he said. So learn the rules before you buy.</p>
<p>In Mexico for example, non-nationals aren't allowed to buy within a certain distance of shores or borders, for reasons of national security. But that can be overcome by setting up a trust to purchase the property, for which title insurance is available.</p>
<p>Other things to think about are local laws relating to rentals. If the property is to be rented out, chances are tax must be paid on the rental income, both Kelly and Ingram said.</p>
<p>While owners may be tempted not to pay the tax, Kelly recommends against it. If you don't pay and the government finds out, you will have to go through a hearing and the government could put a lien on the property.</p>
<p>"So it's better to be safe than sorry," Kelly said.</p>
<p>Don't forget about visa requirements to stay in the country where you buy, Ingram said. While no visa is needed for the U. S., if you stay too long you may have to pay tax on your worldwide income. And if you're not careful, you may lose your entitlement to your medical services plan; B. C., for example, requires residents to be physically present in the province for at least six months of the year.</p>
<p>"So get proper advice" before you buy, Ingram advises.</p>

be some good buys on properties in Mexican cities like Acapulco
because visitors fear drug-related violence and H1N1 flu.

<p>Provincial agriculture, fisheries and food officials confirmed yesterday one case of H1N1 virus on a Quebec hog farm.</p>
<p>The Type A influenza strain was identified in one pig on Friday at a federal laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Officials say the other animals on the farm have not been affected and there was no animal-to-human transmission of H1N1.</p>
<p>Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You cannot get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products, health officials say.</p>

<p>The H1N1 flu is very serious, even though many think it is minor. I live in a seniors residence and I have seen how fast a flu can spread where I live, so just imagine how fast it will spread when children go back to school in September. The vaccine will not be ready until mid-October, so why not put off going back to school until mid-October? It could save many lives. Extend the kids' summer holidays and add the time on next summer.</p>

<p>Lucien Bouchard came in for fierce criticism in 1996 when he blurted out that Canada "is not a real country." Bouchard quickly conceded that the remark was ill-considered. And yet, time and again vagaries arise in federal-provincial relations that suggest that he might have had a point.</p>
<p>The latest such case is the failure of federal and provincial authorities to get their act together in sharing data in the event of health emergencies.</p>
<p>This is a pressing concern in light of warnings from public-health officials that a second wave of swine flu this fall could be far worse than the first.</p>
<p>Comparisons with the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 are perhaps alarmist, but the parallels should not be ignored. That flu, which eventually killed 50 million people worldwide, including 50,000 in Canada, was caused by a variant of the same H1N1 virus we're facing now.</p>
<p>It, too, came in a relatively mild first wave before a renewed assault after a mutation rendered the virus deadlier and more contagious. Today's medicine is better equipped to deal with a viral plague, but modern travel now facilitates any disease's rapid spread.</p>
<p>This is no time for jurisdictional bickering. A resurgent swine-flu epidemic would recognize no provincial borders. And yet the Public Health Agency of Canada says some provinces are lagging in signing on to a draft agreement to share clinical data and laboratory results with the national health agency.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency won't say which provinces and territories are holding back, but Quebec, whose jurisdictional obsessions at times overrule common sense, is a likely delinquent.</p>
<p>So far Ontario is the only province to have officially signed on. That's no coincidence: Ontario learned its lesson the hard way in the SARS outbreak six years ago. This time, holdout provinces should take heed and shape up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Federation of Canadian Municipalities is complaining that Ottawa is insufficiently prepared for a serious outbreak. This has a certain whiff of pre-emptive buck-passing about it. It's true that Ottawa has articulated no strategy for the tricky and touchy business of deciding which groups get priority for vaccination, and for what drug treatment might be available. But since vaccine won't be available until November, the delay in announcing a plan is not really troubling.</p>
<p>That said, Ottawa should certainly take the lead in summoning provinces to a meeting to articulate strategy for any major outbreak.</p>

<p>With her first week of university looming on the horizon, catching the flu is the last thing on Céleste Lordet's mind.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old, who will be starting a degree in political science at McGill University in September, said she has heard a bit about the H1N1 flu virus, but it doesn't worry her too much.</p>
<p>"I still know people who are flying to Mexico," she said. "I don't see it as a big danger."</p>
<p>University and college administrators in Montreal aren't so confident and are already preparing for potential outbreaks of H1N1 on their campuses in the fall.</p>
<p>Hand-sanitizing stations are being set up in dorms and classrooms, websites are being launched to educate students and parents about the virus, and special committees have sprung up to organize efforts to combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, it's almost a wait-and-see scenario," said Pierre Barbarie, associate director of university safety at McGill.</p>
<p>According to Barbarie, McGill has already ordered 12 mobile hand-sanitizing stations to be set up during the notoriously messy frosh-week festivities.</p>
<p>Université de Montréal has gone a step farther, installing dispensers at the entrance to each building, while Concordia recently published a statement saying they were "closely monitoring the evolution of the virus."</p>
<p>Each September, thousands of students pour back into Montreal for the start of the fall academic term. Unfortunately, those first few weeks of class coincide with the beginning of the North American flu season, and some experts are warning that campuses will be prime breeding grounds for the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>"Universities bring people from all over the world ... from countries where the rates of infection are higher," said Dr. Gerald Evans, president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Canada. "You're also bringing a lot of people into close contact, which helps to facilitate influenza transmission."</p>
<p>In an effort to slow the spread of H1N1 and prevent possible mutations, the Public Health Agency of Canada has been bombarding people with the same set of guidelines for weeks: Wash your hands regularly, avoid physical contact with anyone who might be sick, and stay home if you start exhibiting signs of the flu. But Barbarie said the last two rules present a unique problem on university campuses, where students live cramped together in dormitories.</p>
<p>"In most of our residences, you don't share a room, but you share the washrooms," he said.</p>
<p>"If somebody were to get sick, we would try to figure out how to divide the washrooms so that the person would only use one particular sink, or one particular stall."</p>
<p>Students like Lordet, who will be living away from home for the first time this fall with several roommates, are being advised to pack extra hand sanitizer and soap alongside their bedspreads and CD collections. If students do begin feeling sick, Evans said, it's crucial they see a doctor immediately before their symptoms worsen.</p>
<p>"For some reason, young people seem to have a problem with this pandemic strain," he said. "The more severe cases have tended to be among young people. Many of these kids will be far from home and their family doctor, so health clinics really need to be prepared."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cute and beloved WPBS</b>
</div><div>Ken Gray   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>820 words</div><div>29 July 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Why do Ottawans love WPBS-TV Watertown? Because it is smart, somewhat local, familiar, responsive and area residents have shown commitment to it.</p>
<p>And, oh yes, there is a convenient villain to hate: Rogers Communications. Could make for a good soap opera.</p>
<p>How big is the issue?</p>
<p>College Councillor Rick Chiarelli, who is helping with a campaign to reverse the Rogers decision to take the Watertown station off the conventional dial to be replaced by PBS Detroit, says his office fields about 80 calls a day on the question. He calls it "the issue of the summer," which is rather like being the best snow-shoveller in Jamaica. In contrast, swine flu generates about two calls a week in Chiarelli's world.</p>
<p>A <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page created recently to protest the Rogers move had about 400 members as of Tuesday morning. Chiarelli was told by Rogers the company is receiving "thousands" of protest calls. And the station change is right up there with bicycle safety (after the tragic injuries to five cyclists on March Road recently) as the top news item being addressed by Citizen letter writers. So we care, but why?</p>
<p>WPBS is intelligent. You can make a very good argument it is the smartest channel on the dial. Its programming is the kind many would like to see on the CBC main channel, but at which the public broadcaster has failed, often miserably. The only station that comes close to the PBS mandate on local screens is TVOntario, which would be much better if it spent more time covering Ontario, a rather grating oversight.</p>
<p>Smart plays well in smart Ottawa. Our residents are the best educated of the major cities of Canada and one of the communities best adapted for the future in North America, if you believe intellectual Richard Florida, but don't believe in turning a profit. The city has thousands of public servants writing good policy, consultants contributing to and living off this mix, think-tanks, large educational institutions, a big health-care community, high tech and the National Research Council. WPBS is bright television for bright people.</p>
<p>As well, the Watertown station is a bit local. It airs a few shows geared to a Canadian audience but does respond to residents north of the border when they ask for particular programming. That's unlikely to happen at PBS Detroit.</p>
<p>But let's not make too much of this. Watertown rebroadcasts mostly network programming just like its Detroit counterpart (with Detroit likely to be able to buy a few more expensive shows). Dumping Watertown PBS is not losing a lot of local; certainly not as great a gap in area coverage as the demise of A-Channel's 6 p.m. newscast. And yet there is less fuss. Puzzling.</p>
<p>That's where commitment comes in. A substantial part of WPBS's revenue comes from Canada and from Ottawa in particular. When people commit to anything, be it their community, another person, their children, they care. When people donate money to WPBS Watertown, they feel they are part of the station. And let's not forget that in an aging demographic, people tend to prefer the familiar, sometimes even the inferior, to the new and improved.</p>
<p>In contrast to the cute and loved WPBS, there's the big, corporate Rogers Communications that Watertown proponents love to hate. This oligopoly has long had a reputation for slipshod consumer relations, that it doesn't care because you must pay your cable bill no matter what. That said, I'm a Rogers customer for cable and high-speed Internet and today, in contrast to years ago, I find the service reliable if expensive, repairs rapid, and its employees knowledgeable and polite. Still, a bad rep is hard to shake.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what galls Rogers' customers is the lack of choice. I never watch most of the channels on my basic analog service. I like news, sports, movies and educational programming and abhor being forced to pay for rock, country, religious channels and their ilk. Most Ottawans would prefer to purchase what they want, not a package to maximize corporate profits. And yes, I watch Watertown WPBS.</p>
<p>Will Detroit PBS be much different from Watertown? Not likely. A bit more high-quality programming from Michigan; a little less local from upper New York state. Do I care? Not much.</p>
<p>But the people of Ottawa do. They like their little station from just across the border. Their reasoning might not be all that rational, but the emotion is real. A smart company like Rogers should give its customers what they want.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Health Canada has received eight reports of suspected adverse reactions to the antiviral drug Tamiflu since cases of the H1N1 influenza virus began popping up across the country.</p>
<p>The reports were submitted to the Canada Vigilance Online Database, which collects domestic data on side effects from medication, between May 1 and June 30.</p>
<p>The government did not receive any reports during the same period on Relenza, the other main antiviral medication used to treat so-called swine flu.</p>
<p>Details of the adverse reactions were not provided yesterday.</p>
<p>A spokesman cautioned against drawing conclusions about any given drug from what is reported to the database.</p>
<p>"It's important to note that adverse reactions to health products are considered to be suspicious, as a definite causal association often cannot be determined," Stephane Shank wrote in an email yesterday.</p>
<p>He added that spontaneous reports of negative side effects, which are mandatory for pharmaceutical companies to report but voluntary for doctors and patients, cannot be used to estimate how often such cases occur.</p>
<p>The agency that regulates pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom has developed an online reporting system for the millions of doses of medicine expected to be used for the H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Bolton of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said yesterday the agency received 150 reports on Tamiflu and five reports for Relenza between April 1 and July 23.</p>

<p>Medical experts are already saying that this fall will see many thousands of cases of swine flu and that we should prepare. I would like people to consider an obvious solution to one of the obvious vectors for spreading disease -- shaking hands. It's a gross habit and most cultures don't even practise it.</p>
<p>Think about it. You meet someone, you stick out your hand, you smear germs all over the person you've just met and you acquire some new ones to take home for yourself. This is good manners? If so, we need to rethink our rituals.</p>
<p>I'm not going to shake hands anymore, not with anyone. If anyone gets offended I'll happily explain that I'm doing it to avoid spreading disease, and if that makes me look like the reincarnation of Howard Hughes, so be it.</p>

<p>The 45-year-old Johnson is 8-6 with a 4.81 ERA with the Giants this season but hasn't played since injuring himself while batting during a 7-1 loss to Houston on July 5.</p>
<p>The Big Unit told reporters Monday he is feeling better than he originally did, but Bochy said the team doesn't expect Johnson even to resume playing catch for another three weeks.</p>
<p>Change of Sox</p>
<p>BOSTON -- In a swap of outfielders, the Boston Red Sox traded Mark Kotsay and cash to the Chicago White Sox for Brian Anderson on Tuesday. The Red Sox are second in the AL East, and designated the 33-year-old Kotsay for assignment last week. The White Sox are second in the AL Central and sent the 27-year-old Anderson to Triple A last week.</p>
<p>Swine flu costs again</p>
<p>ARLINGTON, Texas -- Texas Rangers pitcher Vicente Padilla, still weak from the swine flu, was scratched from Tuesday night's start against the Detroit Tigers.</p>

</p>
<p>Many organizations are working this week to ensure the Queen City Ex is a safe event.</p>
<p>As in the past, the Regina Police Service has an operational plan in place for the fair, explained police spokeswoman Elizabeth Popowich.</p>
<p>The police service works in partnership with numerous organizations including the Ministry of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing; Mobile Crisis Services; and, the security staff for the exhibition.</p>
<p>"We're hopeful people will be well aware of the many different ways they can request help if need be," Popowich said. "We've had a lot of success in previous years with this partnership approach. We've worked at improving the plan and we've seen a relatively safe, very family-oriented event. We anticipate that same level of success."</p>
<p>The police service's fair plan won't affect its normal operations. It will involve 25 to 35 extra force members for each day of the fair. Some will be in uniform, some will be in special crowd-control uniform and some will be in plain clothes.</p>
<p>Police know from past exhibitions what crimes they might expect, and officers will work to deter crime as well as respond to it, Popowich said.</p>
<p>Popowich advised closely supervising children and carefully securing valuables and vehicles.</p>
<p>About 100 security personnel are employed by Evraz Place, said spokesman Neil Donnelly.</p>
<p>Volunteers wearing "Ask Me" pins can also assist.</p>
<p>Safety is a top priority for <span class="companylink">North American Midway Entertainment</span> (NAME). Boasting the largest travelling amusement park in the world, the company entertains 21 million fairgoers each year at 145 North American festivals.</p>
<p>Each midway employee receives 56 hours of professional safety training and 36 hours of customer service training every year, more than any other company, said NAME spokeswoman Amber Swedgan. The firm employs 18 certified National Association of Amusement Ride Safety Officials, also more than any other company.</p>
<p>"Safety is first and foremost," said Swedgan. "The rides are inspected every single day."</p>
<p>Inspectors from both the provincial government and the company check out the rides. Height requirements and rules are posted at every one.</p>
<p>"I would put any one of my family members on any one of our rides," said NAME spokesman Scooter Korek. "That's what I can say about our safety program. I think we are the best."</p>
<p>Swedgan noted safety should begin at home: Wear comfortable clothes and shoes -- open-toed shoes aren't allowed on some rides -- and sunscreen. Establish a family or group meeting place in case a member becomes separated.</p>
<p>Donnelly advised those with small children to check them into the fair's Lost Kids program. Those enrolled receive wrist bands that correlate with contact information for their parents.</p>
<p>With H1N1 a new concern, patrons will notice more hand-sanitizing units and more signs advising hand-washing throughout the grounds, he noted.</p>

</div><div>Star News Services</div>
<div>845 words</div><div>29 July 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Ian Kinsler drove in three runs, rookie Elvis Andrus homered and had three hits, and the Texas Rangers beat the Detroit Tigers 7-3 Tuesday night in Texas.</p>
<p>Kinsler, who was in a huge funk at the plate that shrunk his batting average from .272 to .242., highlighted a four-run second with a two-run triple. Kinsler had just 16 hits in his last 103 at-bats.</p>
<p>The Rangers have taken two straight from the Tigers after dropping the previous seven meetings and have won eight of nine overall.</p>
<p>Detroit is 4-8 since the All-Star break and its sputtering offence has scored three runs or less eight times in that span.</p>
<p>Ex-Tiger Jason Grilli (1-1) pitched two perfect innings of relief with three strikeouts to pick up the decision. The Rangers bullpen shut out the Tigers on one hit over the final five innings.</p>
<p>Normally a long reliever, Doug Mathis made his second start of the season and sixth of his career for Texas in place of Vicente Padilla, still weak from swine flu and scratched from the start about 31/2 hours prior to gametime.</p>
<p>Mathis allowed three runs and six hits in four innings.</p>
<p>He had been tough out of the bullpen, pitching 17 scoreless innings in relief since he was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City June 3.</p>
<p>But Detroit ended Mathis' consecutive scoreless innings streak at 18 with a three-run second on Ramon Santiago's RBI double and Dusty Ryan's two-run single.</p>
<p>Texas answered with a four-run second off rookie Luke French all with two out -- on Andrus' run-scoring single, Kinsler's two-run triple and Michael Young's RBI double. Kinsler's sacrifice fly in the fourth and slumping Josh Hamilton's RBI single in the fifth ended an 0-for-17 slide to make it 6-3.</p>
<p>For the second straight night, Hamilton started in the No. 7 slot rather than his customary No. 3, as manager Ron Washington tried to take the pressure off the struggling slugger.</p>
<p>HALLADAY STILL A JAY</p>
<p>As of late Tuesday night, Roy Halladay was still scheduled to pitch today -- for the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the Halladay trade talks, there is every indication they will continue into the final hours, or perhaps even minutes, before Friday's 4 p.m. deadline.</p>
<p>Despite another day rife with rumours and allegedly authoritative reports, a deal was not imminent as of Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The "soft" deadline imposed by Toronto general manager J.P. Ricciardi came and went, leaving Halladay to enter another start wondering again if it will be his last as a Jay.</p>
<p>To questions on the status of negotiations, multiple sources hearkened back to recent comments by Halladay and Ricciardi, who both said they believe a trade is unlikely.</p>
<p>That could change in a heartbeat, especially if the Philadelphia Phillies choose the path advocated by many among their passionate fans and media: Pay the price, no matter how badly it hurts.</p>
<p>But Tuesday night, sources said no movement was in sight.</p>
<p>RICHMOND ACTIVATED</p>
<p>The Toronto Blue Jays activated right-hander Scott Richmond from the 15-day disabled list and optioned rookie reliever Dirk Hayhurst to Triple-A Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Richmond was activated Tuesday and will get the start Friday when the Blue Jays open a three-game series in Oakland.</p>
<p>Richmond went on the DL July 5, retroactive to July 1, with a right shoulder injury.</p>
<p>CANADIANS TAKE OPENER</p>
<p>Jack Bondy was the winning pitcher as the Windsor South Canadians defeated the East Nepean Eagles 25-12 in their opener Tuesday at the Little League Ontario Junior Provincial Championship in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Eric Campbell led with four hits and three RBIs, Hunter Smith had six RBIs while Jack Bondy, Joe Charette and Austin Malenfant had two hits and two RBIs each.</p>
<p>Game 2 in the double elimination tournament is today against Oakville at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>ST. PIERRE SHINES</p>
<p>Bobby St. Pierre pitched a two-hitter for the Windsor Selects in a 12-1 win over the Amherstburg Juniors Tuesday in the Mic Mac Junior League.</p>
<p>Leading the Selects on offence were Koddi Quick with three hits and Luke Lefler with two hits.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Tecumseh beat Mic Mac 8-1 and Riverside 12-5, Walker Homesites blanked Riverside 7-0 and the Woodslee-Titans game was cancelled.</p>
<p>HARROW SHUT OUT</p>
<p>Jeff Barker pitched a four-hitter, struck out six and issued one base on balls en route to a 9-0 win for the Harrow Seniors over Leamington.</p>
<p>Jeremy Reese went 4-for-5 with a three-run homer in the top of the fourth inning.</p>
<p>Mark Tiefenbach and Craig Newman had three hits apiece.</p>
<p>For Leamington, Dave Neufeld picked up a pair of singles.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tentative strike deal</b>
</div><div>By Amy Fuller </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>469 words</div><div>28 July 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record. </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Canada's biggest city and tens of thousands of striking workers reached a tentative deal Monday, but the mounds of rotting trash on Toronto's streets won't be disappearing yet.</p>
<p>Thousands of garbage collectors and other outside workers represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees achieved the basis for a deal Monday morning. Later in the day, the city came to an agreement with inside workers.</p>
<p>At a news conference at city hall, Mayor David Miller was conciliatory, praising residents and small business operators for the "tremendous goodwill" they displayed during the strike, and urging residents to be nice to city workers when they return to work.</p>
<p>Miller said temporary dumps will remain open for the rest of the week. Residents can help by continuing to keep their garbage at home if they can, he said.</p>
<p>But with the Civic Holiday coming early next week, cleanup efforts likely won't get underway for several days. When they do begin, the process of clearing the trash and cleaning city swimming pools, daycares and parks won't happen overnight either.</p>
<p>As many as 30,000 municipal workers walked off the job June 22. The strike continued for more than five weeks, halting garbage pickup and leaving Toronto's parks piled high with thousands of tonnes of waste.</p>
<p>Designer garbage bins newly installed on city streets overflowed, while homeowners hauled bags of trash to temporary dump sites. The city issued hundreds of fines and warnings for illegal dumping.</p>
<p>A host of other city services ground to a halt as well. Stranded parents watched all 57 city-run daycare centres close. Ferry service to the popular Toronto islands stopped, with smaller ferries carrying island residents only. Parks stayed open, but maintenance workers no longer kept up the grounds and programming ended.</p>
<p>City pools, community and fitness centres and golf courses closed. The doors shut at five public library branches. Wedding parties couldn't get permits for wedding photos in city parks. With social service workers on the picket line, unemployed residents couldn't apply for welfare payments.</p>
<p>As rotting garbage created fears of rats running rampant, medical officials issued warnings about the health risks. Dr. Allison McGeer, head of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, said Toronto could expect more deaths from the worldwide H1N1 pandemic because of the strike.</p>
<p>Angry residents showed their frustration as the strike dragged through the first month of summer. YouTube videos documented flaring tempers as citizens clashed with striking union employees. One driver rammed a garbage can.</p>
<p>Citizens continued to bring their trash to transfer stations as news of a tentative agreement between two unions and the city reached the picket lines at the Commissioners Transfer Station in Toronto. Steve Russell, Record news services </p>

<div id="hd"><b>Financial crisis makes economy top concern</b>
</div><div>Don Butler </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>378 words</div><div>28 July 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>D10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post </div>
</p>
<p>The global financial crisis has propelled the economy to the top of the list of Canadians' international concerns, supplanting the environment, according to a Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade report.</p>
<p>Terrorism -- identified by Canadians as their top concern as recently as 2004 -- is now barely on the radar.</p>
<p>The results of the annual corporate communications survey for 2008 appear in a report dated July 2009, just posted to a government website.</p>
<p>Asked to name the country's top international concern, 27 per cent of Canadians cite the economy, up from just three per cent in the 2007 survey.</p>
<p>That eclipses the environment, picked by 24 per cent -- a sharp decline from 2007, when 42 per cent chose it as Canada's top international concern.</p>
<p>Afghanistan, where Canadian soldiers have been fighting since 2002, is a distant third at just eight per cent. Six per cent name war in general as Canada's top international concern, while four per cent cite world poverty.</p>
<p>Just two per cent say terrorism is the top concern, down from six per cent in 2007. In 2004, 15 per cent named it as the country's most important international concern.</p>
<p>When survey respondents were asked to choose from a list of foreign policy priorities, however, a different picture emerges.</p>
<p>Twenty-three per cent picked reconstruction in war-torn areas after fighting has stopped as the most pressing priority. Almost as many cited Canada-U.S. relations and asserting sovereignty over the Arctic.</p>
<p>As well, 14 per cent selected fighting the war on terrorism as the top priority, 13 per cent picked reforming the United Nations and five per cent chose preparing for a flu epidemic.</p>
<p>The survey went to field before the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu virus in Mexico.</p>
<p>The survey found strong support for free trade, with 74 per cent -- eight percentage points more than in 2007 -- agreeing that new trade agreements are the way of the future.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds believe free-trade agreements such as NAFTA have a positive impact on the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>The survey was based on 2,491 telephone interviews. Information on margin of error was unavailable Monday.</p>

</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN    </div>

</p>
<p>Quebec is on standby until Canada puts together a national swine flu vaccine guideline, a provincial health official said yesterday.</p>
<p>Karine White, spokesperson for the Quebec Health Department, confirmed that local vaccine plans will not be finalized prior to Public Health Agency of Canada recommendations that the agency has said it will provide closer to November, when the H1N1 vaccine is supposed to be ready.</p>
<p>Quebec is expected to follow Canada's inoculation scenario, White said.</p>
<p>Who, for example, should get vaccinated first?</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has suggested health workers be at the head of the queue, followed by people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women.</p>
<p>According to a Globe and Mail-CTV poll, 62 per cent of Canadians would want a shot against swine flu as soon as it becomes available. But as influenza vaccine production problems persist, the question of who gets the vaccine is paramount.</p>
<p>Vaccine rationing and priorities is the big debate, said Michael Libman, director of the division of infectious disease at McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>The fear is that in the fall, the traditional flu season, the virus might return with a vengeance, he said.</p>
<p>Vaccine manufacturers are being pressed to produce more of both the regular seasonal flu as well as the anti-H1N1 vaccines, Libman said.</p>
<p>"But making vaccine is not like making toys in China.</p>
<p>"Clearly, we won't be able to provide 62 per cent of Canadians with a (H1N1) vaccine in November," Libman said. "We can't just hand it out randomly. That debate is going on quietly and, if a big outbreak happens, it will go loud."</p>
<p>Most people would agree that workers on the front lines - health, fire, police, transportation - should be a priority group, he said.</p>
<p>There will be enough vaccine after an initial shortfall, Libman said, perhaps by using smaller doses with an adjuvent, a product that increases the vaccine's strength.</p>
<p>Fast-track vaccine production has also led to safety concerns. Clinical safety trials began in Europe last week and are set to get under way in the United States next month.</p>
<p>Health officials recall the U.S. swine flu scare of 1976 that lead to a mass vaccination - 40 million Americans got the jab - before serious side effects were detected and 30 died. The pandemic, however, never happened.</p>
<p>Experts say there is enough time to conduct clinical trials before winter, providing H1N1 doesn't mutate into something more virulent.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Burkas are walls, keeping them in, us out</b>
</div><div>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown   </div>
<div>The Independent, London</div>
<div>802 words</div><div>28 July 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>I am a Shia Muslim and I abhor the burka. I am offended by the unchallenged presumption that women covering their heads and bodies and now faces are more pious and true than am I.</p>
<p>Islam in all its diverse forms entitles believers to a personal relationship with Allah -- it cuts out middlemen, one reason its appeal extended to so many across the world. You can seek advice from learned scholars and imams, but they cannot come between your faith and the light of God. Today, control freaks who claim they have a special line to the Almighty have turned our world dark. Neo-conservative Islamic codes spread like swine flu, an infection few seem able to resist.</p>
<p>The disease is progressive. It started 20 years ago with the hijab, donned then as a defiant symbol of identity, now a conscript's uniform. Then came the jilbab, the cloak, fought over in courts when schoolgirls were manipulated into claiming it as an essential Islamic garment. If so, hell awaits the female leaders of Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Soon, children as young as four were kitted up in cloaks and head scarves ("so they get used to it, and then later wear the full thing," said a teacher to me who works at a Muslim girls' school) and now for the graduation gown, a full burka, preferably with dark glasses.</p>
<p>White liberals frame this sinister development in terms of free choice and tolerance. Some write letters to this paper: What is the problem? It is all part of the rich diversity of our nation. They can rise to this challenge, show they are superhuman when it comes to liberty and forbearance.</p>
<p>They might not be quite so sanguine if their own daughters decided to be fully veiled or their sons became fanatic Islamicists and imposed purdah in the family. Such converts are springing up in Muslim families all over the land. Veils predate Islam and were never an injunction (modesty of attire for men and women is). Cultural protectionism has long been extended to those who came from old colonies, in part to atone for imperial hauteur.</p>
<p>Redress was necessary then, not now.</p>
<p>What about legitimate fears that to criticize vulnerable ethnic and racial groups validates the racism they face? Racism is an evil but should never be used as an alibi to acquit oppressions within black and Asian or religious communities. That cry was used to deter us from exposing forced marriages and dowry deaths and black-upon-black violence.</p>
<p>Right-wing think-tanks and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France scapegoat Muslims for political gain and British fascists have turned self-inflicted "ethnic" wounds into scarlet propaganda. They do what they always have done.</p>
<p>Self-censorship will not stop them but it does stop us from dealing with homegrown problems or articulating objections to reactionary life choices such as the burka. Muslim women who show their hair are becoming an endangered species. We must fight back. Our covered-up sisters do not understand history, politics, struggles, their faith or equality. As Rahila Gupta, campaigner against domestic violence, writes: "This is a cloth that comes soaked in blood. We cannot debate the burka or the hijab without reference to women in Iran, Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia where the wearing of it are heavily policed and any slippages are met with violence." What happened to solidarity?</p>
<p>Violent enforcement is evident in Britain, too. A fully veiled young chemistry graduate once came to my home, her body covered in cuts, tears, bites, bruises, all happily hidden from view. Security and social cohesion are all threatened by this trend -- which is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>As for the pathetic excuse that covering up protects women from male lasciviousness -- it hasn't stopped rapists in the most conservative Muslim nations. And what a slur on decent Muslim men, portrayed as sexual predators who cannot look upon a woman without wanting her.</p>
<p>We communicate with each other with our faces. To deny that interaction is to deny our shared humanity. Unreasonable community or nationalistic expectations disconnect essential bonds. Governments should not accommodate such demands. Naturists can't parade on the streets, go to school or take up jobs unless they cover their nakedness. Why should burqaed women get special consideration?</p>
<p>Their veils are walls, keeping them in and us out. We need an urgent, open conversation on this issue. Our social environment, fragile and precious, matters more than choice and custom should to British Muslims. If we don't compromise for the greater good, the future looks only more bitter and bleak. Saying so doesn't make me the enemy of my people.</p>

</div><div>Ottawa Citizen; Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>Canadian provinces are putting the final touches on their orders for swine-flu vaccine, which must be submitted to the Quebec manufacturer within days.</p>
<p>The orders are due by July 31, said Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health officials confirmed Monday that a second Calgary-area woman who was suffering from swine flu had died.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said the middle-aged patient, who had other underlying health problems, died in hospital about 10 days ago, although her death was only announced Monday.</p>
<p>Health officials are identifying their top priority groups to receive a swine flu vaccine because there is a possibility there will be an initial shortage of supply.</p>
<p>So far, those groups include health-care workers, people with pre-existing chronic conditions, residents of remote communities and those under the age of 50--a group unusually hard hit by the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>"The process of who gets it when is an ongoing discussion that's happening right now," King said. "I would expect by the fall we will have determined our priority groups."</p>
<p>King would not say how many doses of the vaccine, which is expected to arrive in mid-to late-November, that Canada will request.</p>
<p>She would only say it would not be enough to cover 100 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>"We would anticipate not everyone will want it and we know not everyone will need it," said King.</p>
<p>Canada has a contract with GlaxoSmith-Kline, which owns a flu vaccine plant in Ste-Foy, Que., to produce the necessary amount.</p>

</p>
<p>I hesitate; she repeats the letters: R-O-E. My brain in overdrive, I shout, "Return on equity reached on error rules of engagement." Gasping, I sit back and close my eyes. A telling pause precedes the doctor's devastating pronouncement: "You have AOS."</p>
<p>AOS: Acronym Overload Syndrome. Struggling to assimilate this unwelcome news, I mentally review the case history I have presented to my FP (family practitioner).</p>
<p>It had all started innocently enough. Effortlessly, thoughtlessly, I picked up common workplace lingo: FIFO (first in, first out, for inventory management); QC (quality control); and all the CEOs, COOs and CIOs (chief executive, operating and information officers) anyone could want.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago I began helping companies respond to RFPs (Requests for Proposal). I was soon at ground zero</p>
<p>of exposure to government acronyms: department names (TBS: Treasury Board Secretariat), position titles (ADM: assistant deputy minister), program names (CAIS: Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization), and processes (MAF: Management Accountability Framework).</p>
<p>I soon spoke not in tongues but in alphabet soup about technical and management topics: MTBF (mean time between failures); PM and CM (preventive and corrective maintenance); PMO (Project Management Office); OJT (on-the-job training); and LOE (level of effort), measured, naturally, in FTEs (full-time equivalents).</p>
<p>These and more slid smoothly from my lips and my keyboard.</p>
<p>Gaining experience, I moved into training neophytes in the seemingly obvious but oft-ignored principle of RFP response: RTQ/ATQ (read the question, answer the question).</p>
<p>Within this environment, my transformation was unremarkable; but a business trip to Anchorage changed the environment. The team assembled at the appointed hour to reach a Cajun restaurant 45 minutes outside town. Our host was likewise punctual, driving a recreational vehicle retrieved from winter storage.</p>
<p>As this top-heavy conveyance lurched alongside the twisty inlet, our unspoken question became whispered conversation: Why had he gone to such effort to provide this eminently unsuitable vehicle?</p>
<p>Eureka. In setting a time for our hotel "rendezvous," we had unthinkingly used a standard Canadian military acronym: RV. Our American host, puzzled but game, had done his best to oblige.</p>
<p>That was my first inkling of TAL (trouble in acronym-land) but multiple expansions for acronyms soon became the puzzling norm.</p>
<p>SME: "subject matter expert" or "small and medium enterprises"? NWS: North Warning System (a network of Arctic radar sites), or an assessment that a mineral deposit was "not worth ..." well, you know? NSA: National Security Agency or "nil situational awareness" (inattention to one's surroundings exemplified by those blocking aisles and sidewalks, blissfully oblivious)?</p>
<p>And, of course, the three-for-one mapping that had precipitated my diagnostically useful meltdown: ROE's financial, baseball and military applications.</p>
<p>As the diagnosis sinks in, I open my eyes to find the doctor regarding me with empathy born of her own battle not just with disease but its acronymized face: HIV, SARS, H1N1.</p>
<p>How had acronyms gotten the jump on us?</p>
<p>In our undergraduate days we felt assaulted by endlessly proliferating numbers: telephone, bank account, identification, licences. Clearly, numbers were on the march, but no one thought much about capital letters. Thirty-five years later, however, we are near to swamped.</p>
<p>Twice- and thrice-used acronyms are common: BW is both "bandwidth" and "biological warfare"; ILS means "instrument landing system," "integrated logistics support," and "integrated logic simulator." In most cases, context is our translation salvation: it's obvious whether NA means North America or network administrator. But our confusion between "not applicable" and "not available" illustrates that clarity can be collateral damage in the undeclared war on full expression.</p>
<p>And us -- are we lambs to this slaughter or the abattoir operators? Cavalierly chopping words apart, we form ESP from "extrasensory perception," IUD from "intrauterine device." Careless of consistency, we allow DND (Department of National Defence) to jettison its preposition, but reverse ground for the GOC (government of Canada). Preferring TLAs (three-letter acronyms) reflects something deep in the human psyche.</p>
<p>Of more psychological interest than acronyms' precise form, however, is how readily we take to them, how easily we are seduced by the allure of convenience, the thrill of being in the know.</p>
<p>Using acronyms signals that we belong -- to an organization, profession, or demographic group. They take jargon one crucial step further, transforming already obscure conversation between experts into arcane exchanges between adepts. As acronyms cause confusion externally, so they build rapport internally, showing others that we've put in our time.</p>
<p>Using acronyms is also easy: they make a big mouthful chewable. Who uses "global positioning system" when GPS lies so readily to hand? If we were all IT (information technology) wonks, wouldn't we, too, succumb to the temptation to use ATM for "asynchronous transfer mode," and hang the overlap with the cash machine? And how can we not be thankful that someone converted "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation" into the tidy "laser"?</p>
<p>Yet the pursuit of convenience misleads us: BTW (by the way), IAW (in accordance with), and IVO (in view of) have all been observed in the wild. There can be no compelling reason to turn these phrases into acronyms.</p>
<p>Or can there? Beset by complexities -- cultural, technological, organizational, relational -- we first tolerate, then expect, and finally need complicated expressions even for simple realities. Bombs become "explosive devices"; walking becomes "proceeding by foot." Yesterday's "experts" become today's "subject matter experts."</p>
<p>Yet what is an expert expert in, after all, if not some subject? Facing expression inflation we reach for help, but in the wrong direction, settling for compression instead of holding out for simplification. And so subject matter experts become SMEs; home-made bombs, now "improvised explosive devices," become IEDs. By converting long-winded expressions into bite-sized acronyms we perversely foster complexity, instead of pursuing simpler, clearer language.</p>
<p>There is no cure for AOS but yesterday my newspaper teased me with false hope ("Government MIA when it comes to good acronyms"): It seems the FIP (Federal Identification Program) is on the case, rationalizing and perfecting acronyms. Somehow, my head still hurts.</p>

<p>A second Calgary area woman who was suffering from swine flu has died, health officials said Monday. Alberta Health Services said the middle-aged patient, who had other underlying health problems, passed away in hospital about 10 days ago, although her death was not announced until Monday.

<div id="hd"><b>Cott frets as titans head down market; Coke, Pepsi battling slumping sales</b>

 </div>
</p>
<p>New Cott Corp. chief executive officer Jerry Fowden has a turnaround plan. But the sagging fortunes of the soft-drink industry's twin giants might get in his way.</p>
<p>With a brutal recession cutting into sales at <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">PepsiCo Inc</span>., the beverage heavyweights are increasingly turning their sights on the low-cost segment of the market.</p>
<p>And that could be bad news for Mississauga-based Cott, the world's biggest maker of private-label soft drinks, which warned yesterday that it's worried about discounting from cola's biggest brands. Cott's shares fell 25.9 per cent, ending the day at $6.16.</p>
<p>“While our performance in the first half of 2009 has been encouraging, we are mindful of challenges that may still lie ahead, such as heavy summer promotions from the national brands, higher commodity costs compared to the first half of 2009 and a changing competitive landscape,” said Mr. Fowden in a statement, even as the company announced its second straight quarterly profit.</p>
<p>Cott, Pepsi and <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> are all battling a slump in sales of beverages in North America. For Cott, an uptick in sales of carbonated drinks was offset by a dip in bottled water sales.</p>
<p>Pepsi has also been struggling with sales of its non-carbonated drinks, particularly Gatorade and Tropicana juices. Low sales for those drinks led to a 6-per-cent drop in Pepsi's overall second-quarter beverage sales in North America and Latin America. Last week, PepsiCo chairman and chief executive officer Indra Nooyi said during an earnings conference call that the company would have to refocus its marketing efforts.</p>
<p>“Clearly some of those [former] users switched to cheaper alternatives,” Ms. Nooyi said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> has also seen a contraction in sales volume in North America as it weathers the industry-wide slowdown in the United States, but has been buoyed by higher sales in India and China.</p>
<p>Cott hasn't had the same luck, as its international sales in Britain and Mexico were also down, with Mexico marking the biggest decline at 32.5 per cent. Cott said sales already plagued by difficult economic conditions were made worse by the outbreak of the H1N1 virus in Mexico in March.</p>
<p>Such concerns cooled the company's forecast for the rest of the year, despite a profit of $33.7-million (U.S.), or 48 cents a share, for the quarter ending June 27. The results beat the analysts' consensus, which had predicted 15 cents a share.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst Kaumil Gajrawala downgraded Cott's rating from “buy” to “neutral” yesterday, citing the possibility of a new share offering. He noted that while the offering would likely drive down the share price, it would in the long run enable Cott to pay down its debts.</p>
<p>Cott's second-quarter revenue declined 5.9 per cent, because of the impact of foreign exchange, dropping to $438.8-million from $466.5-million in the second quarter of 2008. Cott noted that if foreign-exchange items were excluded, revenue would have increased 2.3 per cent.</p>
<p>The results mark the first full quarter under the tenure of Mr. Fowden, who took over as CEO in February, a month after Cott announced that its exclusive contract to supply store-brand pop for <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> would be phased out over the next three years. The loss of the <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> contract was a major blow for Cott, given that the retailing giant represented 40 per cent of its business.</p>

<p>Winnipeg</p>
<p>Small gangs blamed for deadly wedding shooting</p>
<p>Manitoba’s attorney general is promising a swift crackdown on violent street gangs following a brazen shooting at a wedding reception that police say may have been gang related.The shooting at Winnipeg’s Club 13 left one woman dead and two others injured. Dave Chomiak says many top leaders from the Hells Angels and other large gangs are behind bars. It’s the smaller, street level organizations that are now perpetuating the violence, he said. “There are a lot of low-level street gangs that we’re now facing that are loosely organized but are fairly serious,” Chomiak said Monday.</p>
<p>QUEBEC CITY</p>
<p>Greenpeace activists arrested to end occupation</p>
<p>Police arrested 16 Greenpeace activists Monday after they occupied the Quebec City offices of the provincial Natural Resources Department. Activists chained themselves to the doors, blockaded the parking garage and dumped a load of Abitibi-Bowater lumber at the entrance to the building. Greenpeace fears a new forestry law put forward by Quebec will destroy the province’s last intact forest area and wipe out woodland caribou. The group wants the law changed and, since the occupation, won a meeting with Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau on Wednesday.</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Error in spill reporting highlights flaws in system</p>
<p>An environmental group says an error in information about untreated sewage being released into Ontario waterways highlights the need for better reporting of such incidents. Ecojustice says its latest sewage report shows a significant error in the information supplied by Niagara Falls to the provincial government. The group says that underscores the need for public reporting of all sewage dumping incidents. It says the error was made when Niagara Falls incorrectly reported the volume of sewage released during a so-called “bypass” event in September 2007 to Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment.</p>
<p>VANCOUVER</p>
<p>NDP members say B.C. planning big health-care cuts</p>
<p>B.C. New Democrats say a leaked document shows the Liberal government is about to make dramatic health-care cuts to the province’s fastest-growing region because of a $160-million budget shortfall that was hidden from voters during the recent election. NDP health critic Adrian Dix said Monday that the Fraser Health Authority will close at least five operating rooms, reducing the number of surgeries by 10 per cent, along with cancelling 2,000 operations early next year during the Olympics. Two weeks ago, Health Minister Kevin Falcon sent a letter to health authority chief executives ordering them to cut costs to avoid a $360-million deficit, saying the province wouldn’t be providing any bailout money as health-care costs continue to climb.</p>
<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>Alberta records fifth death from H1N1flu virus</p>
<p>Alberta has recorded its fifth H1N1 flu death. Alberta Health says the latest person to die is a woman from the Calgary area who had underlying medical conditions. Dr. Gerry Predy, the province’s senior officer of medical health, says the victim was admitted to hospital in early July and died about three weeks later. This latest death brings to 57 the number of people from across Canada who have died from the H1N1virus.</p>
<p>FINTRY, B.C.</p>
<p>1,000 forest fire evacuees can’t go home until Friday</p>
<p>About a thousand people who have been out of their Okanagan homes since last Thursday have been told they probably won’t be allowed to go back until Friday. Fire officials allowed five residents back to their homes Monday but everyone else is being told to be patient. The Terrace Mountain fire didn’t get bigger over the weekend, but it didn’t get much smaller, either. Gord Molendyk, with Vernon RCMP, said officials aren’t taking any chances. “We now have an area that is declared under a state of emergency,” he said Monday.</p>

</p>
<p>CITY WALKOUT: THE AFTERMATH</p>
<p>It's not smooth sailing yet questions, antagonisms arise over 'compromise' struck on sick days and the time it will take to get city services ticking again.</p>
<p>Hip, hip, hooray. The 35-day municipal strike is over. Way too late; not a moment too soon.</p>
<p>Without releasing details of the deal - the mayor and union leaders say they must first inform rank and file members at a ratification vote tomorrow - both sides claim to have won what they sought and fought for.</p>
<p>City: "We want concessions."</p>
<p>Union: "Over our dead bodies."</p>
<p>"Concessions, big concessions!"</p>
<p>"No concessions!"</p>
<p>"Yes!!"</p>
<p>"No!!"</p>
<p>STRIKE!!! Then, yesterday:</p>
<p>"We were able to beat back all concessions," said union head Mark Ferguson.</p>
<p>"The settlement is within the mandate set" by the city's bargaining team, Mayor David Miller countered.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Strange sport, this labour relations game. It allows both sides to win, while the taxpaying spectators lose? Pardon the skepticism. We'll see about that when the details trickle out.</p>
<p>So while both sides claimed victory yesterday, the public accounting is only now beginning in the summer that never was.</p>
<p>Toronto is a city trying to figure out why it had to endure garbage in its parks, greater exposure to H1N1, dangerously low levels of ambulance coverage and other untold dangers and disruptions for a poorly defined goal.</p>
<p>What did we win, again?</p>
<p>There will be a political price to pay for the controlled chaos of a Toronto strike that seemed to resolve so little while disrupting so much.</p>
<p>Minus all the weasel words and spin expected over the next few days, the city drew a line in the sand over the issue of workers banking sick days for a retirement payout of up to six months pay. And Miller was not prepared to pay the workers full value for taking away the benefit.</p>
<p>If the benefit stays or the city paid out the full amount owing to end the practice, then the strike was a colossal blunder on Miller's part. That deal was available on day one.</p>
<p>And if the union leaders caved after costing their members five weeks' wages, how do they escape the axe?</p>
<p>For today, let's celebrate the return to work of our neighbours, the 30,000 civic workers who keep public services moving in Toronto. And think about five lessons learned from the strike.</p>
<p>One, Torontonians are a proud, peaceful and patient lot. They personally cleaned the streets, mowed playing fields, tended city gardens and endured the hardships with aplomb and only the occasional bluster.</p>
<p>Two, ambulance is an essential service. The province should make it so. The current protocol that guarantees, during a strike, 75 per cent of normal ambulance service is irresponsible. People died waiting for an ambulance. By the end the city was asking for court intervention to add 75 paramedics and 27 ambulances because response times had increased by one minute.</p>
<p>Three, if Toronto is as broke as it says it is, the mayor and council need to act like it. They have zero credibility with their employees and even less with the public when they go on a hiring spree, give themselves pay raises and then try to stiff their rank and file members.</p>
<p>Four, citizens and politicians should end the over-heated rhetoric about crushing the unions, firing them all, et cetera, when workers stage a legal job action. It solves nothing. It sours labour relations. It devalues the work of the public service. It is a no-win strategy.</p>
<p>Five, it is extremely difficult for a pro-union guy to take on the unions. The public didn't take Miller's bluster seriously. They never believed he was on their side. And the unions resented his every utterance.</p>

<p>Unlike Alberta, the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health will not be providing a free universal vaccine program against seasonal influenza this fall.</p>
<p>"At the moment, the program in Saskatchewan is going to be similar to most provinces and territories in Canada in that we will be providing (seasonal) influenza vaccine to the publicly funded program free of charge to high-risk groups only," said Dr. Saqib Shahab, Saskatchewan's deputy chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Alberta Health announced an expansion of its annual flu shots -- which have historically been offered to the high-risk groups for free -- into an $8-million vaccination program for everyone over six months of age. Ontario and Nunavut also offer free universal flu shots.</p>
<p>Shahab said the high-risk groups covered under the Saskatchewan program include seniors over 65, children six months to two years, pregnant women and anyone with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>If other adults are interested in receiving the flu vaccine they can pay a small fee for the service that is provided through public health offices, some doctor's offices and at some workplaces, he said.</p>
<p>"We will be looking at (the universal program) to see what impact the program has on seasonal flu rates and also does it protect people at highest risks, who we recommend get the flu vaccine in any case," Shahab said.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu vaccine won't, however, protect against the H1N1 virus -- the new influenza strain that first emerged in Mexico this spring and has spread around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic.</p>
<p>"The seasonal influenza program consists of vaccines made on the basis of what seasonal strains of influenza are circulating every year," Shahab said.</p>
<p>Flu-shot clinics will be offered in October for people who are considered to be a high risk for developing complications from seasonal flu.</p>

<p>The seasonal flu vaccine won't, however, protect against the H1N1 virus -- the new influenza strain that first emerged in Mexico this spring and has spread around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic.</p>
<p>"The seasonal influenza program consists of vaccines made on the basis of what seasonal strains of influenza are circulating every year," Shahab said.</p>
<p>Flu-shot clinics will be offered in October for people who are considered to be a high risk for developing complications from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>One month later, there will be a separate vaccination program for the H1N1 strain of influenza, Shahab said, adding this vaccine will be offered to everyone.</p>
<p>"The Government of Canada has committed to providing that vaccine more broadly to every Canadian who needs and wants (immunization against the H1N1 virus).</p>
<p>"As we go into the fall and learn more about the epidemiology of this pandemic strain, we will be developing guidelines about who is at high risk and who will benefit the most from this immunization."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health's pandemic preparation plans include a communication strategy to ensure the public understands the difference between the two immunization programs. The ministry and health regions also have a plan in place to ensure the delivery of these two programs.</p>

</p>
<p>Are the province's Crown corporations prepared for a pandemic? They weren't in 2006.</p>
<p>At a public influenza pandemic forum in November of that year, Jim Slater, co-chair of the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's pandemic steering committee, said the Crowns needed to step up their plans.</p>
<p>"We can't deliver any health care if we don't have utilities," he said at the time.</p>
<p>Since then, the Crowns have all had completed pandemic plans by April, according to Debbie Clark, Crown Investments Corporation spokeswoman.</p>
<p>She said the Ministry of Health and the Emergency Management Office recognize the Crown sector "as being well prepared to handle the H1N1 flu outbreak."</p>
<p>At <span class="companylink">SaskEnergy</span> and TransGas, employees and visitors are encouraged to use hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus, said Candace Weimer, communications co-ordinator with <span class="companylink">SaskEnergy</span>.</p>
<p>"We are ... confident that the preparedness plan that is presently in place is one that ensures the safety of our employees and the public," she said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">SaskPower</span> spokesman Paul Spasoff said it also encourages good handwashing procedures, is educating employees about coughing into their arms and widely distributes hand sanitizers so its 2,500 employees stay healthy, he said.</p>
<p>"There's a lot more education on that going on with our employees," Spasoff said.</p>
<p>To ensure uninterrupted service, <span class="companylink">SaskPower</span> has plans to back up critical staff positions.</p>
<p>"Some of the employees need to be on the premises, including the people working in the power stations, but we also have the ability for employees to work at home so they can keep doing their jobs," Spasoff said.</p>
<p>As well as working with employees, <span class="companylink">SaskPower</span> is consulting key suppliers -- from coal to food -- about their pandemic plans.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">SaskTel</span> follows the Ministry of Health's guidelines for ensuring a healthy workplace to protect its 5,000 employees from the H1N1 virus, said spokeswoman Michelle Englot.</p>
<p>Employees with flu symptoms such as fever, headache, shortness of breath or fatigue are asked to stay at home and notify the corporation's health services department, which is monitoring the situation.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">SaskTel</span> has increased the number of hand gel stations and has posted signs outlining precautions in and outside bathrooms.</p>
<p>"We've also increased the cleaning frequency of frequently touched areas in the building," Englot said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">SaskTel</span> has detailed emergency plans in place to ensure that even if many employees are off work, basic services would be maintained.</p>
<p>"The landline would be the No. 1 priority to maintain," Englot said.</p>
<p>Planning is also underway at city hall, says Layne Jackson, deputy of public safety planning and prevention. To educate employees about preventing the spread of the virus, technical bulletins are posted on the local employee website.</p>
<p>The University of Regina has an emergency plan that spans numerous situations, said Barb Pollock, the vice-president of external relations.</p>
<p>"At this moment, we're getting much more detail in it," she said. "We are tailoring one version of it directly for the potential for a problem like (the H1N1 pandemic)."</p>
<p>About 1,000 students live on campus. Last year, the university had approximately 9,000 full-time students and 3,000 part-time students. When pandemic awareness heightened in the community, posters outlining proper handwashing procedures were posted in campus washrooms, but no other institution-wide measures have been taken, Pollock said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health agency to test link between flu, vitamin D; By screening infected blood, researchers hope to find new ways to fight the virus</b>

</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENT REPORTER</p>
<p>In an effort to discover new ways to fight the swine flu, the Public Health Agency of Canada intends to test the blood of people contracting the ailment to check their vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>The agency is taking the unconventional action to try to find out whether those with mild cases of the flu have more of the sunshine vitamin circulating in their bodies than those who develop severe or even deadly reactions to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>If researchers determine that the vitamin protects against the swine flu, it will give health authorities another line of attack against the pandemic, besides such common-sense approaches as large-scale vaccinations and hand-washing campaigns.</p>
<p>A finding of a link to the vitamin would mean that people could reduce the odds of being harmed by the new flu bug by simply popping a low-cost supplement that is widely available at almost every drugstore.</p>
<p>Scientists have long been wondering about a possible connection between vitamin D and influenza because of the striking observations in both the northern and southern hemispheres that flu is mostly a wintertime ailment. This is the period each year when sunshine isn't intense enough to allow people to make the vitamin the natural way – in naked skin exposed to ultraviolet light – causing levels of the nutrient to plunge among those not taking supplements.</p>
<p>The public health agency confirmed the vitamin D research in an e-mail to The Globe in response to questions about the testing.</p>
<p>“Epidemiological evidence suggests a role for vitamin D in seasonal influenza,” the agency said, adding that the low amounts of the nutrient in the winter “appear to correlate with the occurrence of seasonal influenza.”</p>
<p>The annual pattern of influenza – bad in winter and rare in summer – is the reason many health experts are worried that the swine flu epidemic, now running at relatively modest infection rates, will go into overdrive starting in the fall.</p>
<p>The federal health agency cautioned that a causal relationship between not having a lot of vitamin D and the risks posed by the flu remains to be proved, but is said the approach may offer promise in reducing the severity of infections.</p>
<p>A number of university and hospital researchers, in conjunction with the agency, started investigating the possible role of vitamin D and the severity of flu symptoms last year, well before the current outbreak began in Mexico this spring.</p>
<p>But the agency said it has adapted this continuing study to the H1N1 outbreak. As part of the research, the investigators will also look at whether a person's genetic makeup has something to do with the intensity of the flu they experience.</p>
<p>Although not much is known about the ability of vitamin D to mitigate the effects of the swine flu, the agency is citing one tantalizing piece of research suggesting the approach is more than a long shot and actually holds promise in combatting the new pandemic.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, researchers experimenting with mice found that those receiving diets low in vitamin D were more susceptible to an experimental swine-flu infection than those that received adequate amounts of the nutrient, according to the e-mail from the agency.</p>
<p>The reason vitamin D might be able to fight the flu isn't known, but the prevailing hypothesis is that the nutrient is able to strengthen the immune system, allowing those infected to better fight off their illness. Vitamin D has been found, for instance, to offer some protection against tuberculosis.</p>
<p>“The evidence is almost overwhelming that vitamin D appears to be making the immune system attack foreign entities better,” said Reinhold Vieth, a professor in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>He said the agency's research on H1N1 severity and vitamin D levels “bodes really well” for figuring out whether the nutrient can be used to help combat the virus.</p>
<p>The agency said that the way the nutrient might protect against the flu “is not fully understood,” but it said new research “suggests that vitamin D induces the production of antimicrobial substances in the body that possess neutralizing activity against a variety of infectious agents, including the influenza virus.”</p>

<div>THE H1N1 VIRUS / A QUESTION OF ETHICS</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>In a pandemic surge, where's our moral ground? As medical ethicists confront the difficult issues around swine flu, experts say ordinary Canadians should get in on the debate</b>
</div><div>GLORIA GALLOWAY </div>
<div>1076 words</div><div>27 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- ggalloway@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Hard questions about the distribution of health care resources are confronting medical ethicists as pandemic influenza quietly advances. But experts say the same difficult issues should be put to ordinary Canadians who are staring at a virus that could mutate into something very ugly.</p>
<p>Will most be willing to let natives – who have proved especially susceptible to the H1N1 virus – go to the front of the queue for vaccines if the pandemic influenza mutates into something far more deadly this fall?</p>
<p>Should scarce resources, including ventilators, be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis? Or should they go to the person who is sickest? Or to the person who has the best chance for recovery?</p>
<p>And if health-care workers get priority for inoculation and treatment, does that include those who make the vaccine? What about emergency personnel such as firefighters and police? Or transit workers? Or the military?</p>
<p>These are the issues that federal and provincial health officials are debating as they craft guidelines to be used in the event of a pandemic surge.</p>
<p>Peter Singer, a bioethicist at the University of Toronto, says it is important the Public Health Agency of Canada sets priorities before what some doctors say could be the first triage of its kind since the Second World War.</p>
<p>But Dr. Singer said the debate should be broadened beyond health experts.</p>
<p>“There is now about six weeks between now and when a second wave might start. A great use of that six weeks would be to deeply engage the public on how they see the priorities being proposed by experts groups and government groups.”</p>
<p>Dr. Singer urges public health officials to turn to social media such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and reader comments on newspaper stories to gauge how the public believes flu-fighting resources should be dispensed.</p>
<p>The problems that confront a society fighting a pandemic are, in large part, the type that money cannot solve. A vaccine can't be created and distributed faster than science will allow. And there is only so much space in critical-care units with the infrastructure required to run a ventilator.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has stated that health workers should be first in line for vaccines. After that, it is up to countries to draw their own guidelines. The Public Health Agency of Canada said last week that those guidelines will be finalized close to the time that the vaccine is ready for distribution, likely in early November.</p>
<p>And the allocation of treatment provided for the critically ill will require a completely different set of priorities. It will be up to each province or territory – with guidance from the federal government – to develop its own criteria for determining which patients will get preferred access.</p>
<p>Even when the guidelines are drawn, it will not be easy to tell some groups of people they will have to wait for vaccines. And it will not be easy to make life-and-death decisions in hospital wards about the distribution of health-care resources.</p>
<p>Gerald Evans, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Kingston General Hospital, said the guidelines will be useful in terms of developing a general priority list.</p>
<p>But “I think it is going to be much more difficult, as somebody who sees real patients and takes care of real patients, when it gets down to the nitty gritty of two people who are virtually equivalent in terms of what the guidelines might say,” he said.</p>
<p>“That's where it becomes very, very hard. And that's where the guidelines aren't useful. And that's where clinical judgment comes into play.”</p>
<p>But the guidelines will at least provide a starting point.</p>
<p>Ross Upshur, director of the Joint Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto, said there are certain criteria that should never be considered when determining who will get access to health care. These include willingness to pay and a wide range of social factors.</p>
<p>Age alone, for instance, should not decide who gets a ventilator, Dr. Upshur said. Nor should gender, race or religion. “Those are not on the table.”</p>
<p>But how will doctors decide which of two otherwise healthy young adults should be given treatment if there is not enough to go around?</p>
<p>“You could look at ways of treating people equally. The two best ways of doing that are using a lottery or using a first-come-first-serve principle,” Dr. Upshur said.</p>
<p>Or, doctors could make decisions based on established criteria.</p>
<p>“You could look to favouring people who are worst off. That would be giving it to the ‘rule of rescue' – giving it to the sickest first.”</p>
<p>But an argument can be made for doing the opposite – giving treatment to those who have the greatest potential to benefit, he said.</p>
<p>In New York, for instance, a pandemic working group recently developed clinical guidelines that “propose both withholding and withdrawing ventilators from patients with the highest probability of mortality to benefit patients with the highest likelihood of survival.”</p>
<p>Or you could reward social usefulness, Dr. Upshur said. “The reciprocity argument is often used for veterans, they served their country therefore they should have first call to it.”</p>
<p>All of these are simple principles, Dr. Upshur said, none of which on their own is sufficient or complete enough to be the primary deciding factor for the distribution of scarce health resources.</p>
<p>“What you have to do is find ways to integrate, weigh and balance these in relation to each other,” he said. “That's why it starts to become morally complex, when you start to weigh and balance different priority mechanisms against the other.”</p>
<p>In 2005, the Joint Centre for Bioethics created one of the leading documents on ethical considerations in pandemic planning that is being used by governments and health officials around the world.</p>
<p>It provides thoughts for setting guidelines and argues that the public must become involved.</p>
<p>Members of the public are the stakeholders in this exercise, Dr. Upshur said.</p>
<p>“They fund the health-care system through taxation.” And health officials need to “get a finger on the [public] pulse of what's considered to be appropriate or inappropriate on priority lists.”</p>

<p>We're going to be asked to get an H1N1 vaccine for the swine flu, which won't be completely tested before it's rushed out this fall. That doesn't sound safe. Could it be riskier to get vaccinated than not?</p>
<p>Unlike drugs that are used to treat diseases, vaccines have to be kept to a higher standard because they are given to healthy people, so we're very cautious about their safety.</p>
<p>There is a process by which a vaccine gets tested before it gets licensed, starting in a lab, followed by tests on animals, then tests on a small group of volunteers to make sure there aren't any major problems. The next phase is to test it on a larger group--usually hundreds of people --looking for safety issues and also to check the immune response to the vaccine. The third phase is to test it on a large group</p>
<p>of several thousand people before it's licensed.</p>
<p>Normally, this happens over a period of time. But this vaccine is going to be produced very quickly, because we want to get it manufactured and licensed in time to help control this H1N1 outbreak, so all of the usual steps we go through for new vaccines might not be accomplished.</p>
<p>Having said that, there is a lot of experience with influenza vaccines. Companies have been manufacturing these every year, over many, many years, so it's not quite the same as an entirely new vaccine. It's probably not a huge risk.</p>
<p>When the vaccine becomes available-- November at the earliest --the plan is to vaccinate the whole population.</p>
<p>That will be one of our major ways to control the potential outbreak of a pandemic, because H1N1 is such a communicable disease and it's a new strain. Very few people have immunity to it, although those over age 60 have some degree of immunity because they were exposed to similar strains that circulated back when they were younger. So the only way we can actually get it under control is to vaccinate people.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which we can encourage people to come forward is to have a system for compensation in place in case there are any adverse effects from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Because there is some degree of uncertainty, I think it's a good idea that a no-fault compensation program be established in Canada to provide a little more reassurance to people.</p>
<p>No vaccine is 100-per-cent safe. Because it's a biological product, there's always going to be some kind of reaction; some people may be allergic to a component, but most adverse responses to vaccines are mild. That's not to say that it can't happen.</p>
<p>Influenza is one of the most contagious diseases that we know of and washing your hands is an important and easy way to stop its spread.</p>
<p>But if enough people are infected, you may get exposed through somebody coughing or sneezing in your face.</p>
<p>Because virtually everybody in the population is susceptible, and because it's so contagious, hand-washing alone probably isn't going to help stop the spread, so it's important to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, anyone who has a severe allergy to eggs (the vaccine is in an egg base) won't be able to get it. But if it's safe for you, it's best to get vaccinated.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa, provinces lack deal to share pandemic data</b>

</p>
<p>Canadian public-health officials have warned that the second wave of the swine-flu outbreak, expected to hit in the fall and winter months, could be far more severe than the first.</p>
<p>But six years after the SARS outbreak exposed gaping holes in Canada's response to infectious diseases, the federal government still doesn't have a formal agreement with the provinces for how information should be shared.</p>
<p>Public-health policy experts say the lack of such an agreement is not just an academic issue. When Canadians need updates on how to protect themselves against swine flu, they often look to the Public Health Agency of Canada, which in turn relies on provinces and municipalities to provide clinical data and laboratory results.</p>
<p>"In times of epidemic emergencies, time equals lives. That's especially true when you're dealing with an epidemic that's growing exponentially," said Amir Attaran, a University of Ottawa law professor who is an expert on pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>"If you lose even a day in that kind of exponential-growth scenario, you could easily be killing people avoidably. And there will be no time in such a scenario for negotiating the niceties of sharing information."</p>
<p>Then there are the potential financial costs of not reporting information quickly enough to the World Health Organization, which has significant powers to oversee national pandemic plans under international health regulations.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2003, the World Health Organization imposed a travel advisory against any nonessential travel to Toronto, one of the cities hit hardest by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</p>
<p>A provincial inquiry led by the late Justice Archie Campbell concluded that the failure of Ontario health authorities to provide complete data to Ottawa contributed to the WHO's perception that the advisory, which cost the Toronto economy nearly $1 billion and angered Canadian authorities, was necessary.</p>
<p>"That's the big wake-up call that's been missed," said Attaran. "Because (the Ontario and federal governments) couldn't agree on an answer, WHO assumed the worst."</p>
<p>In response to questions from Canwest News Service, PHAC said in an e-mailed statement that a memorandum of understanding on information sharing during a health emergency was "approved in principle" by the federal, provincial and territorial health ministers last September. But not all provinces and territories have signed the agreement, which in any case would not compel them to send information to Ottawa.</p>
<p>PHAC declined to provide a copy of the agreement, saying that would require the approval of all provinces and territories.</p>
<p>It also would not say which provinces have signed the deal. Ontario is one of the few, if not the only, province to have a formal agreement with Ottawa.</p>

</p>
<p>It's amazing what an hour of aimless channel surfing can turn up these days.</p>
<p>After some freewheeling with the remote one night recently, I managed to catch not only half a dozen low-budget makeover shows, but also three ads for FDA-approved pharmaceuticals:one for depression, another for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and a third for inadequate eyelash syndrome -- sorry, "eyelash hypotrichosis." Prescription treatment for "longer, thicker and darker lashes"?</p>
<p>Have we lost our minds?</p>
<p>In the ad, actress Brooke Shields coyly advises women that any eyelid skin darkening that occurs--a potential side-effect of the prescription liquid-- "may be reversible," but "close doctor supervision" could still be necessary. Oh, and did I mention that the proposed treatment can take 16 weeks? Imagine the doctors' billable hours!</p>
<p>How does the pharmaceutical industry have the nerve to tap an already lucrative cosmetics market while keeping a straight face medically? And what exactly was Shields thinking as she read copy that, to my male ears at least, made the product sound downright scary: "There is potential for increased brown iris pigmentation, which is likely to be permanent... for hair growth to occur in areas where(the) solution comes in repeated contact with skin surfaces. If you develop or experience any eye problems or have eye surgery, consult your doctor immediately."</p>
<p>Shields has also made a "video diary" -- you can find it online --to "chronicle her lash journey." It sounds like an epic voyage! "I thought I would be a good candidate" for the prescription treatment, she confides, "simply because over the years I've just been ripping off my false eyelashes while on Broadway."</p>
<p>We do not go to American TV to seek signs of deep thought. The studios that gave us Baywatch, Toddlers &Tiaras and Skating With Celebrities can't be accused of setting our expectations too high. Still, at least we know what we're getting with such shows. Direct-to-consumer, or DTC, pharmaceutical advertising, legal only in the United States and New Zealand, is--or should be--another matter. After all, it concerns public health.</p>
<p>We should recall that we did just fine when these ads were limited to professional journals and health-care providers. That constraint reduced the risk of self-diagnosis -- and spared us the barrage of vanity treatments that now beset us.</p>
<p>In 1997, however, the Food and Drug Administration -- encouraged by the Clinton administration --relaxed its rules on this issue. The pharmaceutical industry was given a green light to bypass providers and market its wares directly to consumers.</p>
<p>To gauge the effect of that change, just follow the money. The year before the ruling, drug companies spent $595 million US on DTC advertising, according to the Food and Drug Law Journal. Within a year of the change, their spending rose to $844 million. By 2000, it shot up to $2.24 billion. And an August 2007 New England Journal of Medicine article put the total for all drug-related marketing in 2005 at $29.9 billion, with$4.1 billion spent annually on DTC advertising. That's more than $11 million a day.</p>
<p>Although "prescription drug spending remains a relatively small proportion (11 per cent) of personal health-care spending, it is one of its fastest-growing components, increasing at double-digit rates" between 1993 and 2001, says a 2003 Kaiser Foundation study.</p>
<p>If Congress is serious about lowering health-care costs, including for vastly expensive (price-controlled) pharmaceuticals, it can start by reversing the 1997 FDA ruling and banning DTC advertising. That's because such costs are always passed on to providers, and then to patients, in the form of higher prices, co-payments and premiums. Even when insurance providers decline coverage for treatments such as "eyelash hypotrichosis," as mine does, they --and eventually consumers--end up subsidizing the treatments because the drug makers inflate prices on regimens that are covered. Above all, there are so many more urgent needs in pharmaceutical research, including dealing with the H1N1 virus and the spiralling rates of HIV infection.</p>
<p>Health-care reform involves a lot more than the bottom line. It's also an opportunity to weigh priorities, push preventive care and re-establish our fundamental needs in public health. If the pharma ads on TV are any indication of our priorities, it's time for some serious discussion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to those desperate for thicker, longer lashes, may I suggest more mascara? Umpteen brands promise "volume express" and a "luscious, intense definition," whose only side-effect is a lightening of the purse.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Extra cash should buy Canadians access to vaccine, poll finds</b>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- As manufacturers remain concerned about pandemic vaccine production rates, almost half of Canadians believe that those willing to pay extra should be first in line to receive the vaccine, a new survey finds.</p>
<p>A Globe and Mail-CTV poll also found most Canadians – 62 per cent – wanted an H1N1 vaccination shot when it becomes available, likely in early November.</p>
<p>“It's kind of your lifeboat question. They don't necessarily want women and children to go first. There's a bit of a level of acceptance that users pay for vaccines,” said Peter Donolo, a partner with The Strategic Counsel, which conducted the poll.</p>
<p>Fears that it may take substantially longer to mass produce a vaccine have heightened because the new virus strain is not growing fast enough in the eggs used as a mainstay of flu vaccine production. Manufacturers report strains are producing barely half as much yield to make vaccines as the seasonal flu virus. Canadian health authorities have indicated groups who receive the vaccine first will likely include remote communities, people with underlying chronic diseases, health-care workers and essential workers.</p>
<p>The poll found that Canadians believe children and middle-aged adults, among the most affected by the virus, should be at the top of the list. Infants, pregnant women and the elderly rank below.</p>
<p>Most Canadians, the survey showed, agreed that swine flu was a serious health threat, but also said the media had hyped up the issue. This was especially true among the highly educated and high-income earners. About three-quarters of those with an annual salary above $100,000 felt the issue has been overblown and were the least concerned.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Canadians were not taking precautions. Almost all of those surveyed said they washed their hands more frequently, as recommended by public health authorities. “Everyone has heard of swine flu. Everyone is washing their hands more, which is remarkable,” Mr. Donolo said.</p>
<p>And Canadians trust health authorities to protect them. Almost one in nine surveyed said health officials were taking proper precautions to prepare, and most said Canada was better prepared than most countries to cope with the virus.</p>
<p>Still, they would support more aggressive actions. Even though the World Health Organization has said the virus can't be stopped from crossing borders, 62 per cent of Canadians would support a government initiative to bar visitors from affected countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, most were against cancelling concerts and games.</p>
<p>“There's an amount of selfishness here, in the sense of the impact on me personally,” Mr. Donolo said. “For example, barring somebody from an affected country doesn't really affect a lot of Canadians in their everyday lives, unless they happen to be a friend or relative of the people that are being barred. But when you start getting into cancelling large public gatherings, like concerts and sporting events, forget it. They don't want to do that.”</p>
<p>The online survey of 1,000 Canadians was done from July 17 to 21.</p>

</p>
<p>When my husband went to pick up my Tamiflu prescription, the pharmacist read it, recoiled, then demanded that he step back and wipe alcohol wash over his hands. You discover quickly, when swine flu hits, that few people's reactions make sense.</p>
<p>Like most of us, I had been scanning the reports of a pandemic with increasing alarm.</p>
<p>I have three children, the youngest under five, and vulnerable, elderly relatives. I wanted, selfishly, to hear of "underlying health problems," not unexplained deaths.</p>
<p>I ascribed the fact that I had felt vaguely unwell for days to the race toward the end of term, with its myriad tasks and work deadlines.</p>
<p>But last Sunday, after taking my daughter to a horse show, I found I could not get up from the sofa. "Is it cold in here?" I asked. "Er, no," my husband said, shifting a few centimetres away from me. I put it -- and my weirdly stiff neck -- down to exhaustion.</p>
<p>When it hit properly later that evening, there was little doubt. My temperature soared, I shivered under a blanket in front of the TV. I was convinced that my face was striped grey and red (my husband stated, reassuringly, that I was just "strangely blotchy").</p>
<p>On Monday morning, in true parent-in-the-holidays fashion, I made myself get up, as if by behaving normally I could make my body believe it. Fat chance.</p>
<p>By lunchtime, I was huddled in bed, waiting for the doctor to call back.</p>
<p>He ran through my symptoms: fever, cough, headache, streaming cold, aching bones, and said -- in the manner of someone who had repeated this conversation 108 times already -- "I think we'll treat you. Get someone to pick up some Tamiflu for you."</p>
<p>When he added that the first 48 hours were as bad as it was likely to get, I was reassured. I wasn't going to die of swine flu. I just had to sweat it out. But once I knew that, I also felt oddly fraudulent.</p>
<p>Our GP reassured me that giving me Tamiflu did not mean we</p>
<p>were depriving an immuno-</p>
<p>compromised baby somewhere. More importantly, he said, it would make me less likely to infect anyone else.</p>
<p>As I write this, I feel I am improving, though I'm exhausted in that peculiarly post-viral way. The Tamiflu may have helped. It's impossible to know how bad I would have felt without it, and it was certainly reassuring to feel that I was doing something. E-mail and my laptop have kept me sane.</p>
<p>Though swine flu isn't fun, I have had worse, and I suspect the majority of people who catch it will feel the same way. The ones I know of who have really suffered with it have contracted other things simultaneously: tonsillitis, or gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the porcine label, I would have just accepted my case as summer flu.</p>
<p>Worse than the physical discomfort was the fleeting sense of being a pariah, the panic in people's voices when they called (although I can highly recommend it for getting rid of door-to-door salesmen -- one of them practically galloped off my front step). Perhaps I would have been just as fearful but I'd like to think not.</p>
<p>Oddly, as more of our neighbours have contracted it, local hysteria levels finally seem to be lessening.</p>
<p>Widespread infection, perversely, may be the only thing that calms us down. As in the worst horror films, it's always the unknown that is most terrifying.</p>

<p>When Dale Altrows showed up at the ER with fever, blurry vision and a dry cough, doctors weren't sure what he had.</p>
<p>Altrows arrived at the Jewish General Hospital on May 17, about the same time as H1N1 cases leveled off in Mexico, considered the epicentre of the virus, and World Health Organization experts warned of a potential worldwide outbreak.</p>
<p>Officials at the Jewish weren't taking any chances. They suspected Altrows had pneumonia, but they also tested him for swine flu. Twice.</p>
<p>The first test came back negative but Altrows's health deteriorated rapidly. The infection in his lung took over. He needed help breathing. His family was warned that he might not make it.</p>
<p>A second test confirmed H1N1 virus. "I don't remember anything after that," Altrows said.</p>
<p>He awoke in ICU five weeks later - freaked out because he couldn't walk or talk. "He was in a medically induced coma," said his partner, Carl Olssen.</p>
<p>Now that he's home, Altrows says that swine flu fears are no hype even though stories of infection no longer make front-page headlines.</p>
<p>"The seriousness of the flu should not be downplayed," said Altrows, who initially went to a hospital in LaSalle, where he was prescribed antibiotics. He landed at the Jewish two days later when his symptoms worsened.</p>
<p>Altrows's family filled him in on what had happened. He was placed in isolation and heavily sedated.</p>
<p>Despite getting doses of Tamiflu, his organs started shutting down.</p>
<p>His kidneys failed, blood clots filled his lungs, and he needed a tracheostomy, a surgical procedure to create an opening through the neck into the windpipe, to breath.</p>
<p>"Doctors were very clear about whether he would live or die," Olssen said. "They told me he might die and he wasn't in the clear for a long time." It was a very difficult time, Olssen recalled, "but I was struck by one thing: The kindness of the doctors, nurses and orderlies." The majority of people infected with swine flu have mild illnesses that don't require medical intervention, said Paul Warshawsky, a specialist in intensive care at the Jewish.</p>
<p>"But this was at the beginning. No one knew what was happening in Mexico and why it was so severe," he said.</p>
<p>Most people who died of swine flu had pre-existing medical conditions. Altrows had asthma.</p>
<p>Altrows had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, a severe inflammation of the lungs that has a mortality rate 40 per cent, Warshawsky said.</p>
<p>"He came sick and got sicker quickly. We were able to turn that around. A lot of nurses worked very hard on him, so we're pleased," he said.</p>
<p>He was put on a special ventilator that vibrates the lungs and provides the equivalent of three to 15 breaths per second, then surgery to his windpipe.</p>
<p>A month later, doctors opened his chest to remove stagnant blood. That's when he started to improve.</p>
<p>The Quebec public health department is reporting 488 hospitalizations because of swine flu and 17 deaths.</p>

<p>Swine Flu - a British city council said saturday it was considering using underground burial chambers, currently a tourist attraction, to store the corpses of swine flu victims if the pandemic worsens.</p>
<p>exeter city council in southwest england said the empty 19th-century catacombs could become an emergency mortuary.</p>
<p>a council spokesman said the plan could be put into operation if the cemeteries and the crematorium could not keep up with funeral demands.</p>
<p>he said: "we have some empty catacombs in an old cemetery in the city. these are 19th century underground burial chambers which are normally a tourist attraction," he said.</p>
<p>"they can, however, be safely used for their original purpose and allow us to temporarily store bodies in the remote possibility that the need should arise."</p>
<p>figures released friday showed that 72 people were in hospital with swine flu in the devon and cornwall area surrounding exeter, while 2,000 visited their doctors for treatment.</p>
<p>at least 30 people with swine flu have died in Britain. officials said that there were around 100,000 new cases of swine flu in england last week as a new website and telephone service was launched to help people identify symptoms and receive drugs.</p>

<p>I read last week about federal Industry Minister Tony Clement begging Nortel to "at least" consider a Canadian offer in the course of selling its assets. This says a lot about the real power that national governments have in this global economy. This is not just a Canadian problem. In fact, when we say that the president of the United States is "the most powerful man on Earth," we are talking about an illusion.</p>
<p>The reality now is that power has escaped the hands of any national government and lies in the boardrooms of international business organizations. Politicians used to have real power when major corporations had a national scope.</p>
<p>Things have changed with globalization, and the epicentre of power has now moved from national capitals to a place that escapes any institutional control.</p>
<p>In fact, it is this international centre of power, with no fixed address and no official organizational chart, that gives marching orders to national governments.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the multinationals. Taking advantage of new technology, different demographic developments and needs, and the end of conventional barriers, they have been able to escape from the control of every national government, while international "governments" like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization are so concerned about consensus that they largely stopped making real decisions many years ago. And when they do make one, nobody cares anyway.</p>
<p>Just think instead about the activities of the multinationals in the sectors of health care, finance and energy. Can any national government control them? Is there any international organization able to regulate them?</p>
<p>We know the answer. Their activity goes well beyond the power of any national government, including the White House, and there is no international organization with enough clout to keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>If governments, meaning politicians, cannot have any kind of control over health, money and the economy, can anyone explain what kind of power they have?</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the events of the last few years.</p>
<p>We have an energy crisis, with the price of gas going up without any real control by national governments. We are in an economic recession because the banking system has operated for years without any control or set of real rules.</p>
<p>Then we have the perennial crisis in the health system with the multinationals always making a load of money producing medicines for potential pandemic diseases that no one even knows exist or how serious they are, but we cannot afford to pretend that they are not.</p>
<p>We already have national governments committed to pharmaceutical multinationals for more than $10 billion (U.S.) for the H1N1 virus. Every time the World Health Organization upgrades the warnings, governments around the world, prisoners of moral blackmail, increase their funding to multinationals. The same multinationals that have medicines to fight AIDS that are not available to people dying of the disease get money from national governments to produce antidotes for cyclical "pandemics" that cause the death of fewer people than a seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>The reality is that with the new world order, the centre of power has shifted from the national capitals to an international market: the former set the needs, the latter set the price and the taxpayers pay the bill.</p>
<p>Everybody has made an effort to adapt to the new reality, except for politicians.</p>
<p>The world of business has been the first to take this opportunity to adapt and now corporations operate in a legislative vacuum that allows them to do whatever they want at the expense of national taxpayers.</p>
<p>The world of sports is becoming more and more international, and even criminal organizations long ago abandoned their national identity in creating international connections. The only people still trapped in their backyards, called riding associations, are politicians.</p>
<p>The irony is that even the people upset with politicians are now also internationally organized, like the No-Globals.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in trying to keep getting elected, politicians are still engaged in long, empty debates about angels dancing on the head of a pin, while multinational corporations and criminal organizations are operating internationally and planning how to squeeze more money from our pockets.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Two sides of the Hawaiian Islands; The beaches are nice, but to see real life you have to get out in the country</b>
</div><div>Bill Robertson </div>
<div>Special to The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>2022 words</div><div>25 July 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>E14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>One day more than 30 years ago, my father came home to supper with a grim look on his face. At coffee that afternoon he'd heard that nine couples from our small town had met for drinks at a lounge on Waikiki Beach. They felt this was the highlight of their trip.</p>
<p>His face betrayed his thinking, but he said it anyway: "The thought of going halfway across the Pacific for a holiday just so I can sit with all the people from coffee row is more than I can stomach." A Hawaiian vacation became something of a topic to be avoided in our home -- a hellish oxymoron where you took your troubles to paradise.</p>
<p>Now, 35 years later, I was forced to confront an old prejudice when planning a trip to Australia. Sure, my wife and I could fly 17 hours straight from Vancouver to Sydney, or we could break up the trip with stops in Hawaii, as many experienced travellers insisted we do.</p>
<p>Like most prejudices picked up at a father's elbow, my fears were silly and largely baseless. We wouldn't be travelling with a group or to meet a group. In fact, on the way out we wouldn't even be going to the usual tourist destinations, at all.</p>
<p>Through a combination of amazing circumstance on her part and great luck on ours, an old Saskatchewan friend now lives on Hawaii, or what is called the Big Island.</p>
<p>She had been asking us to visit, so we came, flying through Denver to Kailua-Kona, then making the hour's drive north along the west coast to their town of Hawi.</p>
<p>They live on seven acres on the north side of town amid other parcels of similar size. Besides running a business out of his house, Laura's husband also keeps a few cows and some chickens; and the neighbours have horses, goats and sheep, as well. To a boy from the Prairies, the sight of cattle grazing beneath palms and among citrus trees is a bit of a jolt. Bright red cardinals, saffron warblers and olive-green Japanese white-eyes calling from fences and trees only enhanced the clash of the exotic with the ordinary.</p>
<p>But then, as Laura explained on a drive "over the mountain" to the city of Waimea (not to be confused with the surfer's mecca on the north shore of O'ahu), this area of the Big Island has long been home to an imported cowboy culture.</p>
<p>As we drove up and inland, through shortgrass pasture and cacti in yet another of the island's 22 ecosystems, she told us that early settlers discovered an environment ideal for ranching, so they brought in cattle and started training locals as cowboys.</p>
<p>Waimea, nestled at the foot of the Kohala Mountains, celebrates its cowboy heritage in statues, western stores and such venues as the Parker Ranch Museum, none of it the sort of thing I ever envisioned when I thought of the Hawaiian Islands. Indeed, a short visit was enough for me and I wanted to get back within sight of the ocean.</p>
<p>No problem. We could see the water from either Laura's place, or Hawi and the walk between. Hawi is a laid-back little place where, on a Sunday, locals gather in front of the coffee shop to grab a beverage and sit out front, listening to a couple of guys blow jazz on soprano sax and guitar. We found a great place for lunch called Sushi Rock and the namesake was fresh and imaginatively presented.</p>
<p>A short drive east from Hawi along the north shore of the island we stopped at Kauhola Point and then Akoakoa Point, watching the ocean crash against the rocks below as we listened for birdsong, and in between at Keokea Beach Park, where we threw our leis into the water, thereby ensuring -- according to local legend -- that we would return to the islands.</p>
<p>The promise came true three weeks later when we flew into Honolulu from Sydney, wending our long way home. But now, tired from nearly a month of living out of a suitcase and from this most recent, 10-hour turbulence-fest from Down Under, the thought of three days on the most famous beach in the world did not thrill me. Living the easy-going life of a pineapple cowboy on the Big Island was one thing, but hitting Waikiki Beach just as university students had completed exams was another.</p>
<p>We had booked online into the Miramar Hotel, a smaller place amid the Hiltons and Hyatts, just a block off the beach. At $89 US a night I could probably stand to get over some of my jet lag, anyway. Our porter reassured us that the crowds were actually not that thick, thanks first to the recession and now to the swine flu hysteria causing cancellations in droves. After our overnight flight, we were let into our room at noon where a shower and change of clothes helped improve my attitude to hot-weather fun.</p>
<p>A tentative reconnoiter down to the beach, dressed as I was like a 50-year-old in shirt, shorts and sandals while surrounded by a robust gallery of triangular bits of cloth held together by string, left no lasting paralytic effect. My anxiety over crowds melted away as I discarded my sandals and waded in the Pacific, laughing as all manner of surfers, children and guys like me practised on their rented boards.</p>
<p>I paused to brush the sand from my feet, leaning on the statue of the great athlete Duke Kahanamoku, a hero of Hawaii who took surfing to the rest of the world and eventually served 13 terms as sheriff of Waikiki. Now I'm in countless pictures, bending over to put on my sandals, as Duke and his surfboard are a must-have for all photogs.</p>
<p>We rushed across busy Kalakaua Avenue to a hole-in-the-wall place called Furusato Sushi Bar. There were three chefs plying their trade, and we took a small table for two where we could watch the sun go down. We ordered two sashimi dishes and a seafood salad, then went for blue fin tuna, purchased that morning at the famous Pier 38 fish market. We got five slender slices of toro for a small fortune, but each melt-on-the-tongue morsel was worth it. I'm ruined for Saskatchewan sushi for at least three months.</p>
<p>After an early night and a good sleep we took the advice of one of our hotel clerks and caught a bus, right outside our hotel, to Pearl Harbor. Bad idea. The bus was late, then quickly filled as it swayed into every stop and red light between our hotel and the memorial. An hour-and-a-half later we emerged, hot and irritable, at the USS Arizona Memorial, only to be told to walk far across a parking lot and around a construction site to the USS Bowfin Memorial, where we would be issued with free tickets to come back to the USS Arizona. Huh?</p>
<p>What they really wanted us to do, I think, was check all bags, purses and backpacks for security reasons, and the people who did that were over at the Bowfin. We got our tickets, came back to the Arizona, had a wander through the museum, and then lined up for the presentation and film. Here was a speech from a volunteer on the nature of the memorial itself and a black and white documentary on the Pearl Harbor attack. We were then ushered out onto a navy launch for a ride out to the USS Arizona Memorial itself, located as it is on the sunken remains of the battleship in which are entombed 1,177 sailors, killed in the Dec. 7, 1941 air raid.</p>
<p>When we emerged from the memorial, the fact that no bus was on hand to take us back didn't bother us. We had already decided on a cab and took a cruise with an Egyptian man whose brothers made a fortune in Winnipeg and who couldn't praise U.S. President Barack Obama enough. That was typical. Back on the Big Island the talk had all been glowing on the subject of "their president." Laura's husband, Michael, had attended the same high school as Obama, as had their neighbour, and there was the hospital where he was born, said the cabbie as we rounded a corner.</p>
<p>After a bit of lunch and a nap, I was seeing three days in Waikiki not so much as a liability but a limitation. If we'd had more time, I would have liked to take an Oahu Nature Tour out to the North Shore. Justly famous for its surfing -- see the documentary Riding Giants -- the North Shore is also renowned for its birds, turtles and archeological sites. Alas, it was an all-day trip. So, like most North Americans when faced with such a dilemma, we went shopping.</p>
<p>The Miramar's back door opens onto the International Market, a colourful warren of little shops selling cheap T-shirts (mostly to do with drinking, surfing and Obama), loud Hawaiian shirts (of course I bought one), postcards, bags of seashells, silver jewelry and tattoos. I'm not sure where the International in its name comes from, but the place was lively and fun and almost impossible to escape.</p>
<p>But we did. And in our remaining day-and-a-half, we managed a meal up in the Kaimuki district at a place called the 12th Avenue Grill. It was nice to get out of the bustle of Waikiki for a few hours and see the city at night and from a few different elevations.</p>
<p>In the morning, we walked past the zoo but didn't go in. It was hot and we walked beneath the palms, doing a mild bake before donning our swimsuits and getting into the water, hats and sunglasses still attached.</p>
<p>Rolling about with the gentle tumble of the waves, beach bunnies and surfers frolicking about us, children laughing and shrieking at water's edge, I couldn't articulate to myself what it was about Hawaii I'd felt the need to avoid. I hadn't done or seen a fraction of all there was to do and see on these islands, having been lucky enough to see only two sides of their many lives, but I knew it would be easy to come back. We'd have to get out of the water, spray off and go pack, but for now we just smiled and let the water carry us.</p>

<p>IF YOU GO</p>
<p>- Getting to the Hawaiian Islands is easy. Just about everyone you know has been there and they all have recommendations on what way to fly and where to stay. Listen to them.</p>
<p>- Take down names. Then go online and book your flight(s), your hotel, even your tours, if you want. I favour being on the ground before I do the latter.</p>
<p>- If booking online seems scary, contact a travel agent. Or get your kids to help you. Once I had booked the Miramar (on the advice of a friend), I phoned (they're four hours behind) and asked about early check-in and things like that. With the slow economy, you'll find that the tour people will come to you to offer their services.</p>

<p>To invent a great product is not enough. To manufacture a great product is not enough. If you want great rewards, you need great marketing.</p>
<p>Nobody knew this better than John Barry, who died this week in California at the age of 84. The marketing genius behind WD-40, Barry transformed an obscure spray lubricant into a worldwide household name.</p>
<p>WD-40 was invented in 1953 and sold to NASA and a few other industrial customers by the Rocket Chemical Company. When Barry took over in 1969, he immediately changed the name to the <span class="companylink">WD-40 Company</span>. We're not making rockets, he explained.</p>
<p>Barry conceded that WD-40 was not much better than a lot of similar products. What propelled the brand to annual sales of more than $200 million in 160 countries was superior marketing.</p>
<p>"We may appear to be a manufacturing company," he told Forbes Magazine, "but, in fact, we are a marketing company."</p>
<p>It was under Barry's direction that WD-40 got its trademark blue and yellow can, among the most recognizable of labels. He also promoted the product's many uses, some 2,000 of which are listed on the company's website. It would be almost as easy to list what the stuff isn't good for.</p>
<p>Here, then, in honour of the late, great John Barry, is a sampling of the few uses for which WD-40 is not, repeat, not, recommended:</p>
<p>Hair tonic</p>
<p>Chicken marinade</p>
<p>Bear spray</p>
<p>Clean chewing gum from priceless paintings</p>
<p>Soothing after-shave lotion</p>
<p>Substitute for vermouth in martinis</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans could die over the next two years if the vaccine for the new H1N1 influenza is not effective and, at the pandemic's peak, as much as 40 per cent of the work force could be affected, according to new estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>And worldwide, as much as one-third of the Earth's six billion population is likely to become infected with the virus, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Although potentially frightening, the numbers are not dramatically different from the number of cases that might be encountered in a bad winter of seasonal flu. Even in an unremarkable year, an estimated 36,000 Americans die from complications of the flu.</p>
<p>The estimates, prepared more than a month ago but released only Friday, are not based on an enhanced lethality of the new H1N1 virus, but rather on the lack of resistance to the virus in the general population and its continuing spread through the summer, when flu viruses normally become quiescent.</p>
<p>Twenty states are reporting widespread or regional flu activity, with the H1N1 virus predominating, according to Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "That's very unusual at this time of year," she said. "It's a testament to how susceptible people are to the virus."</p>
<p>British health authorities have reported 100,000 new cases of the virus, known informally as swine flu, in the last week, indicating that the virus is continuing to spread there as well. Experts blame the higher rate in that country, compared with the rest of Europe, on Britain's role as a transportation hub for the rest of the continent.</p>
<p>The foci of many of the U.S. cases have been summer camps and military installations, where young people gather in close proximity. "This has been a challenging summer for camps, with a lot of outbreaks [and closures]," she said. There have been many media reports of summer camps urging children to bring the antiviral drug Tamiflu to camp and take it prophylactically, and that has concerned the CDC because such widespread use could lead to increased resistance to the drug, which is the first line of defense in treating infected people.</p>
<p>In cases where the agency has investigated, however, it has been unable to confirm such reports.</p>
<p>The agency's current recommendations are that the drug be used only for treating infected patients and for prophylaxis of high-risk people who are in close contact with flu patients.</p>
<p>According to the most recent figures posted Friday morning, the U.S. has so far seen 43,771 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 and 302 deaths.</p>

</p>
<p>HALIFAX</p>
<p>The first Canadian province to report cases of H1N1 flu recorded its first fatality linked to the illness when a Nova Scotia woman in her 50s died Friday, two weeks after she was admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief public officer of health, said the woman had underlying chronic diseases, but wouldn't reveal what those were or any other details about her.</p>
<p>Strang said officials expected there would be deaths linked to the H1N1 virus and that it does nothing to change their preparations for an outbreak of a more virulent strain this flu season.</p>
<p>"This sad event is a reminder to all of us that the H1N1 pandemic in Nova Scotia is very serious and is not over," he told reporters at a briefing Friday.</p>
<p>"We have expected to see severe cases, perhaps even deaths . . . and are focused on preparing the health system to deliver care to people with flu and non-flu."</p>
<p>The death - also the first in Atlantic Canada - brings the total number of fatalities across the country to 56, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>There have been 19 deaths in Quebec, 18 in Ontario, seven in Manitoba, four in Saskatchewan, four in Alberta, two in British Columbia and one in Nunavut.</p>
<p>Strang cautioned that while the number of cases continues to rise, the majority of people are exhibiting mild, typical flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>But he added that what makes H1N1 unique is that it is hitting the young and healthy the hardest, unlike common flus that usually afflict the elderly and sickly more severely.</p>
<p>There have been a total of 456 lab confirmed cases of H1N1 in Nova Scotia, with 10 hospitalizations to date.</p>
<p>"People need to take this seriously and individuals must take responsibility to protect their health . . . by looking after their hygiene needs," said Dr. Ken Buchholz of the Department of Health.</p>
<p>Canada's first cases were reported by a group of students from a private school in Nova Scotia who travelled to Mexico last winter. All had mild symptoms and have recovered.</p>
<p>On Friday, officials at a cadet training camp at CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick said they had two confirmed cases of H1N1 flu and 25 suspected cases, with all being put in isolation.</p>
<p>Health officials in Canada and around the world are trying to determine what groups of people will receive an H1N1 vaccine first as the flu season sets in this fall.</p>
<p>Strang suggested it's likely that groups that appear to be more vulnerable to severe illness, such as pregnant women and people with chronic diseases, will be vaccinated first.</p>
<p>Strang said officials are closely watching how the flu season is playing out in the southern hemisphere and will glean what they can about how H1N1 flu behaves.</p>

</div><div>Angela Hall </div>

</p>
<p>Only a handful of people have fallen mildly ill from a new flu strain recently discovered in Saskatchewan, a reassuring sign that the virus is a "dead end," a senior health official says.</p>
<p>"There seems to be no concern in terms of this becoming a greater problem. It seems to behave as a sporadic, dead end infection," said Dr. Saqib Shahab, deputy medical health officer for the province.</p>
<p>But the province will continue to closely monitor the situation for at least another four to six weeks, Shahab said.</p>
<p>Three hog farm workers in eastern Saskatchewan were ill last month with the new strain -- which is not associated with the H1N1 pandemic -- while another five possible cases from the same location are still being investigated, Shahab said in an interview this week. But all eight people were only unwell with mild flu symptoms for two or three days and have since recovered, he said.</p>
<p>Health officials held a press conference in early July to reveal testing had detected the new strain, noting it was largely discovered due to the enhanced flu surveillance taking place because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>"A year or two ago, these kind of events would not even have been noticed. In a way it just demonstrates the excellent surveillance system in place ... that's why this very mild illness was picked up and followed up on," Shahab said.</p>
<p>The new strain was made up of components of a seasonal human flu and a pre-existing animal flu strain.</p>
<p>The concern was that the new flu might start transmitting from person to person, although officials indicated from the start that they didn't believe that would be the likely scenario.</p>
<p>It may never be absolutely clear where the virus originated, with flu viruses routinely circulating in both the animal and human populations.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's very difficult to get to the bottom of these things," Shahab said.</p>
<p>Shahab said the health ministry is working with the other agencies to reinforce the importance of farm biosecurity measures to prevent exposure to viruses.</p>
<p>There hasn't been a problem with the illness in the hogs at the operation where the individuals who fell ill work, he said.</p>
<p>"We've been working very closely with Saskatchewan Agriculture and CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) and the animals in general have remained healthy throughout this instance."</p>

<p>Thanks to the Internet, writers today can upset readers halfway around the world. The ping in my email box is a Kiwi correspondent. Her complaint is that equality remains elusive. Female child-care workers in Wellington, New Zealand, still earn 9.5% less than male child-care workers.</p>
<p>"I know you oppose pay equity," she writes, "so what's the solution?"</p>
<p>What's the problem?</p>
<p>It's a rhetorical question. The problem is the parity bug. Never mind the swine flu; the epidemic sweeping our epoch is parity. We have parity on the brain. We call it equality, but it isn't. Parity may be equality at the starting gate, but getting all participants to reach the finish line in a dead heat isn't equality, it's fixing the race. Equality is compatible with freedom; parity needs government intervention.</p>
<p>Equality means both men and women are free to choose between, say, romance and career. Parity would require them to do so in equal numbers. Of course, they don't. Friends tell me they never met a man who gave up a lucrative career for love. Well, I have. One. I met him about -- let's see -- 31 years ago. He quit a six-figure job in Toronto to marry a girl in Saskatoon.#</p>
<p>During the same time, I met dozens of women who had done the same thing. No, they didn't all move to Saskatoon, they just sidelined their careers for personal reasons. Recently, I came upon a note a friend sent me 20 years ago to introduce a lady who, he wrote, "gave up a lucrative career in France for the sake of true love and marriage in Toronto." She looked a little lost when I met her, but ended up working in her field again in a less senior position. There's nothing wrong with interrupting one's career for love, except choices have consequences and add up to statistical trends. As women make such tradeoffs more often than men, for the same education, talent and years of experience women as a group tend to make less money.</p>
<p>There may be prejudicial and discriminatory causes for income disparities still, but by now, if a woman of equal ability lags behind a male colleague on the earning-and accomplishment-ladder, chances are she has chosen to sideline her career or education for romantic or some other personal reason at least once. Many women select their field of initial study so as not to interfere unduly with their private lives. After graduation, if they have a choice, they may take or refuse work assignments and responsibilities, not just according to how lucrative or challenging</p>
<p>they are, but how much they may or may not cramp their style as lovers or homemakers.</p>
<p>This is rarely disputed. Frankly, the evidence is so plain that it would be hard to dispute it. What's hotly disputed is why. Some say it's because women and men have different natures; others that it's because they're raised differently. Society puts different pressures and expectations on men and women.</p>
<p>Both sides may be right. Very likely, men and women are what they are by nature as well as nurture. Customs and traditions rarely evolve in a vacuum or in opposition to biochemistry. As a rule, customs only reinforce and ritualize what human beings have a natural tendency to do anyway. Even Castro-class tyrants would find it hard to make men devour nurses' romances or turn knitting into a spectator sport. You can mould human nature only so much.</p>
<p>Will women continue to put career second to love more often than men? Given our changing social climate, not as much as before. But as long as they do at all, the statistical gap between the incomes of men and women will remain despite all pay equity legislation or affirmative action.</p>
<p>Of course, a society could refuse women the right to choose love over career, as the late feminist Simone de Beauvoir suggested. A Supreme Court stacked with judicial activists might find such legislation constitutional. Perhaps a draft has already reached the desk of the 21st century's great champion of change, U. S. President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Until then, though, disparities will be universal. Not necessarily between the same groups: In Japan, for instance, The Daily Yomiuri saw an income gap three years ago mainly between young and old, while in China during the same period the People's Daily discovered the widest chasm between rural folk and urbanites. In America the big gap was still between black and white, and only in Canada did gender edge out both region and race. The 2006 figure was 71%. That's what women who worked full-time all year around earned compared to similarly engaged men, according to Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>The 2006 study that impressed me most was conducted for The Korea Times. After carefully considering available statistical data, it concluded that in South Korea the most significant income gap was -- guess what? -- between rich and poor. I've no doubt that this was accurate at the time, though after the economic upheavals of recent months one can no longer be entirely certain.</p>

<p>Swine flu has spread to nearly every part of the globe, the World Health Organization says, admitting it's still unknown how the virus would mutate in the northern hemisphere's winter.</p>
<p>With the death toll rising rapidly and countries rushing out new ways to check the spread of A(H1N1), the United Nations agency said it was only a matter of time before the pandemic that began in March affected every country.</p>
<p>At least 160 of 193 WHO member states have cases, spokesman Gregory Hartl said. The A(H1N1) virus, which the WHO declared a pandemic in June, has resulted in about 800 deaths, he added.</p>
<p>The United States, Mexico and Argentina have tallied the highest number of fatalities.</p>
<p>The crisis has prompted governments and corporations to stockpile antivirals.</p>
<p>Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche reported that sales of Tamiflu soared 203 per cent in the first six months of 2009.</p>
<p>In Britain, Europe's hardest-hit country, about 30 people have been killed.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Local health officials don't know yet who will be first in line for the vaccine against the H1N1 virus when it becomes available.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that is because H1N1, now at pandemic levels, isn't behaving the same way as other diseases, says Waterloo Region's associate medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang.</p>
<p>Elderly people are usually the most vulnerable to disease, but the victims of H1N1 tend to be younger, Wang said.</p>
<p>"The older population seems to be more resistant to it," Wang said. "Very few people over 65 get it. Most people (with the disease) are under 20."</p>
<p>Experts are still studying data from around the world on how the virus acts, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is winter, and flu season.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason the federal and provincial governments haven't yet come out with a plan for vaccines, or a plan for what to do if the disease becomes more widespread here.</p>
<p>And there are other questions, such as whether health-care workers should be at the front of the line for vaccines.</p>
<p>That's the recommendation of the World Health Organization, but the Canadian government is still considering it.</p>
<p>Waterloo Region has confirmed 32 cases of the virus, but no deaths.</p>
<p>Across Ontario, there have been 3,800 cases and 16 deaths.</p>
<p>Local public health officials need a plan soon, including the priorities for vaccination, and which organizations will be responsible for setting up clinics.</p>
<p>"We probably need to know . . . in the next few weeks," said Wang. "The more time we have, the better."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health officials are reminding people to prevent the spread of the disease by:</p>
<p>Washing hands often;</p>
<p>Sneezing into a tissue, or into the crook of the elbow;</p>
<p>Staying home when sick, and avoiding other people.</p>
<p>Local school and universities are ready to respond to direction from health officials.</p>
<p>At Wilfrid Laurier University, a pandemic plan has been in place since the SARS outbreak in 2003 – and it has already been activated, said vice-president Jim Butler.</p>
<p>"With this particular virus, the most vulnerable group is university-aged people," Butler said</p>
<p>The university is now using hospital-grade disinfectant to wipe down high-traffic areas such as handrails.</p>
<p>Face masks are ready if needed.</p>
<p>A "pandemic day" is planned for the start of the school year, when students will learn about the disease and receive bottles of hand sanitizer to help stop the spread of infection.</p>
<p>A special committee has been meeting since spring, sometimes every day, said Butler. Designated staff communicate regularly with the local health department.</p>
<p>Communication – both with health officials and within the university community – is also a key strategy of the pandemic plan at University of Waterloo, said university representative Michael Strickland.</p>
<p>The UW plan also outlines which parts of the university must keep going in a pandemic, sometimes right down to the individual staff member.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Local officials are preparing plans for the fall flu season to ensure schools are ready through a variety of comprehensive measures.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on proactively nipping any problem in the bud.</p>
<p>"If it's done well on the prevention side, hopefully we won't end up in a pandemic," Wellington Catholic District School Board education director Don Drone said Friday.</p>
<p>It's a work in progress, but initial planning has begun by Drone's board, his public board counterpart and the area health unit.</p>
<p>"The schools have all submitted pandemic plans to us," Upper Grand District School Board education director Martha Rogers said.</p>
<p>Boards across Ontario are being similarly cautious. The approaching flu season is taking on heightened interest with the arrival this spring of the H1N1 strain in dozens of countries.</p>
<p>Rogers noted recent initiatives that include distributing information to all the schools on preventive sneeze and cough etiquette, handwashing with soap and water, the use of hand sanitizers and instructional posters that are to be placed in washrooms and classrooms.</p>
<p>Each school has received bottles of sanitizer for classrooms and common areas like libraries, as well as facial tissues and hydrogen peroxide-based cleansers. The cleaners are intended to kill H1N1 and other pathogens from surface areas children, teachers and staff may come in contact with. Custodians have been asked to redouble efforts to sanitize sites such as door handles, water fountains and desktops, for example.</p>
<p>The board intends to continue with these precautions until the World Health Organization or Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health deems the risk of infection has passed.</p>
<p>Further, the public board is also continuing with an early-warning system instituted last year that Rogers calls a "sentinel" program because it acts like a canary in a coal mine to warn of impending danger.</p>
<p>Rogers said the board is providing basic school attendance information, but without identifying specific students, to the health board so it can monitor the nature of absenteeism. That should give public health an early indication if any pattern develops, such as a rising number of students sick with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Over the months, it hasn't pointed to an outbreak of H1N1 because there hasn't been one, Rogers said.</p>
<p>"To date, we haven't, obviously, had a problem."</p>
<p>Possible courses of action like school closures in the event of an outbreak will be explored with the health board, Rogers added. Broad student and school safety issues are part and parcel of this dialogue.</p>
<p>"That's another conversation we'll have," Rogers said.</p>
<p>Drone's board is taking similar precautions, currently drawing up protocols on preventive measures and what to do if cases of H1N1 are discovered in the schools.</p>
<p>He wants to ensure parents of first-time students such as those coming into junior kindergarten emphasize basic cleanliness practices to their children and recognize that flu symptoms must be reported quickly to school and health authorities.</p>
<p>The school boards and health board are working together to devise simple, common signage for the schools that focus on good hygiene. It'll be recognizable to students of all ages, Drone said.</p>
<p>Some will be pictorial.</p>
<p>"We're trying to have age-appropriate signage for very young children."</p>
<p>The board is making an inventory of sinks in each school, including those not normally used for handwashing, like those in art classes, to clean materials.</p>
<p>The intention is to make improvements where needed so they can be used as handwashing stations. The board is also making hand sanitizers available in various.</p>
<p>Cleanliness can't be ignored in the face of a potential H1N1 outbreak, Drone reasoned.</p>
