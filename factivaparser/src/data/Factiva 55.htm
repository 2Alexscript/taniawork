<p>It's An Odd World</p>
<p>Revenge Takes Its Toll</p>
<p>Two feuding families near Lenoir, N. C., created a ruckus in May after a dog killed a neighbour's cat. The cat's owner then shot the dog dead. The dog's owner shot the cat's owner and the man's young daughter. Deputies were called, and the dog's owner shot both of them, but one got off a return shot, fatally wounding the dog's owner (and completing the chain).</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The myth of cheap public auto insurance</b>
</div><div>Calgary Herald</div>

</p>
<p>F ew Canadians have much affection for insurance companies; in the event of a claim and a dispute about proper compensation or coverage, insurance rapidly become as popular as hives or H1N1.</p>
<p>But that reality is no reason for Albertans to jump to government automobile insurance. This latter idea was again floated by a New Democrat member of the Alberta legislature, Rachel Notley, after the Alberta Court of Appeal reinstated a$4,500 cap on soft tissue injuries.</p>
<p>Notley claimed "public auto insurance is the way to go," and that "B. C., Manitoba and Saskatchewan are cheaper with a public system."</p>
<p>Actually, Notley is incorrect in at least one comparison and misses the reasons why, on average, some provinces with government insurance may be cheaper but how that has nothing to do with a government system. But first to the comparisons.</p>
<p>In a 2007 study from the Winnipeg-based Frontier Centre which looked at actual premiums paid by motorists across the country, there was no simple public-cheaper, private-more-expensive conclusion.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2005 inclusive, Ontario with private sector insurance had the highest average premiums, including in 2005. But in that year and in five out of the six other years, it was followed by British Columbia, where all mandatory coverage must be bought through the government insurance company. Alberta was third place most years.</p>
<p>The Frontier Centre study --unlike others which purported to show private sector auto insurance was always exorbitantly expensive, was based on actual premiums paid by actual motorists to come up with an average for each province; the faulty studies from others compiled averages based on Internet quotes -- which represent nothing actually paid.</p>
<p>In 2008, Ontario still had the highest average premium at $1,313, followed by B. C. at $1,166, and Alberta at $1,052. Some might argue that if two out of the top three are the highest, that still shows government insurance is the better deal. No, it doesn't, because consumers get what they pay for and also what they receive in claims in the event of an accident.</p>
<p>In 2008, the average claim cost was $10,863 in Ontario -- the highest in Canada. It explains why their premiums are the highest. Alberta's average claim cost is second-highest at $6,110; that compares to $2,924 in British Columbia. As for Saskatchewan and Manitoba, no figures are available as the government insurers don't release their average cost figures, despite being "public" auto insurers.</p>
<p>A last point that informed Albertans should know is that government insurance in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, along with private coverage in Atlantic Canada, is on average cheaper because of caps on the sort of pain and suffering awards recently the cause of so much debate here in Alberta.</p>
<p>The Atlantic provinces have a $2,500 cap (or deductible) on pain and suffering awards. Manitoba and Saskatchewan have no-fault systems that don't allow policyholders to sue at all for pain and suffering -- the Saskatchewan exception being if one buys the more expensive tort option, in which case the pain and suffering claim is still subject to a $5,000 deductible.</p>
<p>In short, government auto insurers pay out less in average claim costs, and provide less --or nothing--for pain and suffering of the sort subject to a $4,500 cap in Alberta.</p>
<p>Consumers get what they pay for and the notion that government systems provide a better deal on insurance is a myth when one understands the difference in the insurance product.</p>

</p>
<p>First Nations leaders have long claimed that living conditions in their communities are just like "Third World countries" but the rest of Canada has never seemed to quite agree.</p>
<p>While aboriginal people decry the amount of foreign aid that is paid to Third World countries in Africa and Asia, Canadians continue to support international relief agencies with donations of money and goods and services -- the kind that doesn't go to Indian reserves. The prevailing attitude is that tax dollars pay for Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and many other kinds of support for aboriginal people.</p>
<p>Ironically, it took the outbreak of H1N1 flu to really begin associating the situation of First Nations with Third World status. Now, international organizations like Doctors Without Borders are getting involved.</p>
<p>It is all going to come to a head in about six weeks. That is when pharmaceutical companies expect to complete development of a vaccine against the H1N1 flu. Then they will begin manufacturing millions of doses to immunize the human population but that will take some time. Economic superpowers like the United States, England and Canada have already anted up millions of dollars to buy enormous supplies of the vaccine so that mass immunization of their populations can take place as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Third World countries are already complaining that they may not be able to afford the vaccine, that there won't be enough to go around and that they will have to wait until after supplies of vaccine have been distributed in rich countries before they can get access to the flu shots that will prevent their people from getting H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>What is going to happen to the Third World nations in Canada? We have already recognized that the H1N1 flu spreads more rapidly and seems to have more serious effects in aboriginal communities. This is because, like other Third World countries, many First Nations homes do not have running water, abundant supplies of fresh, clean drinking water are scarce and homes are seriously overcrowded with 12 to 14 people often living in one house, which is often covered in mould. Sanitation and sewage treatment are at a premium. Citizens already suffer from respiratory illnesses at a higher rate and the general conditions of poverty exacerbate the spread of flu.</p>
<p>There has been some scrambling to respond to the current crisis wherein H1N1 has struck disproportionately and more seriously in First Nations than elsewhere. For example, more doctors and nurses are going into First Nations. But Garden Hill had to spend $15,000, which was supposed to be used for graduation ceremonies, on surgical masks and other medical supplies.</p>
<p>First Nations are so far behind that three chiefs from the Island Lake area (population 10,000) travelled to Ottawa to lobby for a temporary field hospital while pointing out that Neepawa (pop. 3,800) is already served by a permanent hospital with 38 beds.</p>
<p>Garden Hill Chief David Harper also took pains to reinforce the Third World theme by pointing out that Canada spent $425 million to help rebuild foreign countries after the tsunami in 2004 but is ignoring the pleas from reserves for improved housing and infrastructure. Will our priorities change now that the flu crisis has turned Canada's First Nations into actual Third World countries?</p>
<p>The distribution of vaccines is really going to tell us a lot about whether or not our perception of First Nations really has changed. Like other developing countries, First Nations cannot afford the vaccines. They fear they may have to wait until the rich people are immunized before they get their flu shots, if there are any left.</p>
<p>Current estimates are that one out of every two Manitobans will acquire the H1N1 flu (a frighteningly high figure but one that could be skewed because it could be that nine out of 10 aboriginal citizens catch this flu while one out of five citizens from the rest of the population comes down with it)Common sense tells us that First Nations should be the No. 1 priority when it comes to distributing the H1N1 flu vaccine. But history tells us that First Nations have always been last in line for just about everything. Despite the fact we all know that First Nations require immunization much more greatly than any other population, will the Canadian government and medical authorities respond in kind?</p>
<p>Complicating all this is a debate taking place between traditional Indian medical healers who claim the vaccine will "make our people sick" and do more harm than good. First Nations leaders will have to resolve this debate quickly and then begin lobbying for mass immunization on a priority basis immediately if that is what they choose to do.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- With outbreaks of the H1N1 swine flu a real possibility this summer, directors of youth camps are urging parents to be straight with counsellors about medical conditions their children may have, and to keep their young ones at home if they develop flu symptoms.</p>
<p>In many cases, camp directors are taking extra precautions to screen campers for signs of illness -- coughing, fever, diarrhea, vomiting -- in the hope of minimizing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The Ontario Camps Association, which represents camps attended by 350,000 children annually, has sent an e-mail to its 350 members warning that summer camps have the potential to be a "breeding ground" for the virus.</p>
<p>The association has urged camps to report to the association and to public-health officials any time they see three or more cases of the flu within a four-day period.</p>
<p>Extra infection-control measures are expected to be enforced this summer, including installing hand-sanitizing stations, ensuring common areas such as bathrooms are cleaned regularly, and screening campers for flu-related symptoms.</p>

<p>OCEANIA</p>
<p>MAN SENT HOME WITH BROKEN NECK</p>
<p>SYDNEY -- An Australian hospital apologized Sunday after a man was told to go home and take headache pills even though he was suffering a broken neck that could have paralyzed him at any moment.</p>
<p>Sydney-based Paul Curtis said he was lucky not to be a paraplegic after the mix-up last month at Ryde Hospital in the city's north.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old went to the emergency ward late on a Friday night suffering severe pain after accidentally clashing heads with a friend.</p>
<p>He was told the X-ray department was closed and he should go home and take some pills.</p>
<p>Curtis followed the advice but returned to the hospital on Monday morning after suffering an agonizing weekend only to find that a bone was broken in his neck, threatening to sever his spinal cord.</p>
<p>Curtis underwent surgery and faces months of rehabilitation wearing a neck brace.</p>
<p>"When the doctor told me 'you're lucky to be alive, you're lucky not to be a paraplegic', that really rattled me a bit," he said.</p>
<p>The head of Ryde Hospital's emergency department Peter Roberts said late-night procedures for patients needing X-rays would be reviewed in light of the case.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>REBELS ATTACK 3 SHELL PIPELINES</p>
<p>LAGOS -- Nigerian militants attacked three Shell pipelines in just 24 hours over the weekend -- sparking concerns that the escalating political volatility could drive up oil prices.</p>
<p>Shell would not say whether operations had shut down in the Niger Delta region as the company begins an investigation into the scale of the damage.</p>
<p>But the oil giant confirmed that there have been three attacks as part of an ongoing sabotage campaign.</p>
<p>The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (Mend) claimed to have struck Shell's pipelines at Adamakiri and at Kula.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>U.S. READY FOR ANY N. KOREAN ATTACK</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The United States is "fully prepared for any contingencies" regarding a potential missile launch toward U.S. territory by North Korea, President Barack Obama said in an interview to be aired today.</p>
<p>"This administration -- and our military -- is fully prepared for any contingencies," Obama told CBS when asked about the possibility that North Korea could fire a missile toward Hawaii.</p>
<p>Asked if that meant Washington was "warning of a military response," Obama answered: "No. It's just we are prepared for any contingencies.</p>
<p>"I don't want to speculate on hypotheticals. But I do want to give assurances to the American people that the Ts are crossed and the Is are dotted in terms of what might happen," he added, according to excerpts released Sunday.</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
<p>KITE-FLYING PHONE SMUGGLERS HIT SNAG</p>
<p>SAO PAULO -- Two Brazilian teenagers were arrested on the weekend for allegedly plotting to smuggle cellphones into a prison using a kite, reports said Sunday.</p>
<p>According to police, the two unidentified adolescents were arrested late Saturday with two kites and mobile phones inside a building in Tremembe, a town outside Sao Paulo, the G1 news website reported.</p>
<p>Police said the two confessed to planning the operation, and said they were to have received $175 through an ex-girlfriend of a prisoner in the town's Tarcizo Leonce Pinheiro Cintra penitentiary.</p>
<p>Incarcerated criminals in Brazil often go to great lengths to acquire and use cellphones to keep illicit businesses running from behind bars.</p>
<p>On Friday, G1 reported, a prisoner being transferred from a temporary detention centre in Tremembe to a Sao Paulo prison set off a metal detector. Wardens found a cellphone, battery and charger inserted in his anus.</p>
<p>11 AIR FRANCE BODIES ID'D</p>
<p>SAO PAULO -- Eleven of the 50 bodies recovered from an <span class="companylink">Air France</span> jet that plunged into the Atlantic three weeks ago have been identified by fingerprints and dental records, Brazilian officials said Sunday.</p>
<p>The bodies were identified as "10 Brazilians and one foreigner," officials in the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco said in a statement.</p>
<p>There were 228 people from 32 countries aboard the airliner, which went down June 1 off the coast of Brazil.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>IRAQI INSURGENTS KILL NINE POLICEMEN</p>
<p>BAGHDAD -- Insurgents have shot dead nine policemen in Iraq's two most populous cities of Baghdad and Mosul, police and government officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Four policemen were shot dead by gunmen while on patrol on Saturday in separate incidents in the predominantly Sunni Arab Baghdad district of Jamiya on Saturday, while another two were killed in clashes between insurgents and security forces on Sunday in the same neighbourhood.</p>
<p>"All (four) were killed by insurgents carrying pistols with silencers who passed nearby, opened fire, and fled immediately," a police official told AFP of Saturday's incidents.</p>
<p>Also in Baghdad on Sunday, two policemen on patrol were killed and one other wounded by gunmen in Ghazaliyah, another Sunni neighbourhood in west Baghdad, an official said.</p>
<p>In the main northern city of Mosul, meanwhile, insurgents using pistols with silencers killed another policeman on Sunday, a local police official said.</p>
<p>A roadside bomb targeting police in the city also killed a civilian and wounded three people, one of them a policeman, the official added.</p>
<p>It was the latest bloody bombing in the runup to the planned pullout of U.S. troops from Iraqi towns and cities, due by June 30.</p>
<p>Violence has dropped markedly in Iraq in recent months, with May seeing the lowest Iraqi death toll since the 2003 invasion.</p>
<p>ISRAEL PROBES ACTIVIST WEBSITE</p>
<p>JERUSALEM -- Israeli prosecutors on Sunday ordered a criminal investigation into a website that it says published a picture of a soldier with the caption "murderer" and asked readers to identify him.</p>
<p>Indymedia Israel, a news site and activists' forum, on April 17 posted pictures taken at Bilin, a village adjacent to Israel's West Bank barrier where a Palestinian protester was killed by Israeli forces hours earlier.</p>
<p>One of the pictures showed a soldier's face alongside the caption "murderer from Bilin," the state prosecutor's office said in a statement.</p>
<p>"This soldier in this picture murdered Bassem Abu Rahma ... do you know his name?" prosecutors quoted the website as saying.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Abu Rahma died in a hospital after a tear gas grenade fired by Israeli forces struck him in the chest.</p>
<p>But prosecutors claim the soldier, who they say might easily be identified from the image, had nothing to do with the incident.</p>
<p>Deputy chief prosecutor Shai Nitzan ordered police to investigate whether Indymedia Israel had breached the soldier's privacy.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>HONG KONG LISTS 65 NEW SWINE FLU CASES</p>
<p>HONG KONG -- Hong Kong on Sunday reported 65 newly confirmed cases of swine flu, bringing to 320 the total number of infections in the southern Chinese city.</p>
<p>The new cases involved 32 male and 33 female patients between seven and 57 years old, the Department of Health said, without commenting on their condition.</p>
<p>The department said four secondary schools, attended by students among Sunday's confirmed cases, had also been advised to close for 14 days.</p>
<p>INDIAN MAOISTS KILL 11 COPS</p>
<p>RAIPUR, India -- At least 11 special police personnel were killed and 10 injured in a landmine blast triggered overnight by suspected Maoist rebels in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, police said Sunday.</p>
<p>The attack took place late Saturday when a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) team was patrolling the Pushpal Road area, 500 kilometres from the state capital Raipur and a hotbed of rebel activity.</p>
<p>T.G. Landkumer, a senior police officer in the state, told AFP the CRPF men had gone to the area to investigate reports that suspected Maoists had blown up some vehicles ferrying workers engaged in road construction.</p>
<p>"The men were on their way back when their vehicle ran over a landmine," Landkumer said.</p>
<p>The killings came amid efforts by Indian security forces to quell a Maoist-led uprising in the eastern state of West Bengal, where security forces are battling to retake control of hundreds of villages.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>ITALY'S OPPOSITION IN DAMAGE CONTROL</p>
<p>ROME -- Italy's opposition was hoping to limit the damage Sunday in the second round of local elections, as Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's turbulent private life continued to grab the headlines.</p>
<p>Voters also cast ballots in a referendum that could give more power to the big parties, but analysts say the initiative may fail to get the 50 per cent turnout needed to be valid.</p>
<p>Berlusconi's right-wing allies made gains in the first round of partial local polls two weeks ago when Italians voted in more than half of the country's towns and provinces as well as the European parliament elections.</p>
<p>The elections end today.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, meanwhile, denied reports in several papers Sunday that he was selling the luxurious villa in the island of Sardinia where scantily dressed young women accompanied his guests.</p>
<p>Berlusconi went to court to get a ban on photographs showing him in the gardens of the villa alongside topless women, and another photo of a totally naked man.</p>
<p>Some of the pictures were published in Spain's El Pais newspaper.</p>
<p>BRITAIN NAMES DEAD HOSTAGES</p>
<p>LONDON -- Britain identified the bodies Sunday of two bodyguards who were among five men held hostage in Iraq for two years, and called for the immediate release of the remaining captives.</p>
<p>The remains were "highly likely" to be those of Jason Swindlehurst, 38, from Skelmersdale in northwest England, and Jason Creswell, 39, from Glasgow, in Scotland, the British Foreign Office said.</p>
<p>They were among four guards protecting British computer consultant Peter Moore when around 40 heavily armed militants seized all five men in Baghdad in May 2007.</p>
<p>The bodies of the two bodyguards were handed over to the British embassy in the Iraqi capital on Friday.</p>

<p>They've had 233 days to learn on the job, which is five weeks longer than the average Canadian student's school year. That suggests the party leaders and Stephen Harper's Cabinet have had enough time to absorb the briefing books, find their feet in Question Period and learn how to stamp out fires flaring inside their circle of responsibility.</p>
<p>That means it's report card time for a mostly mediocre group of leaders and senior Ministers, with grades based on outside observations (mostly mine) and confidential assessments from Hill staff, MPs and a trio of Ministers. -Don Martin, National Post</p>
<p>MICHAEL IGNATIEFF LIBERAL LEADER</p>
<p>B He's reunited the party and nudged it into a tie with the Conservatives in almost every poll, restoring adult supervision and giving hope to its demoralized ranks. Fundraising has been ramped up and his outreach tours have attracted decent interest, even in Alberta. His Harper Employment Insurance extortion move didn't work -- bluffing never does against this Prime Minister -- but at least it delayed a summer election to a time when he'll be better prepared and stand an improved chance of winning.</p>
<p>JACK LAYTON NDP LEADER</p>
<p>C+ While he's getting bashed all over as a dead leader talking, Mr. Layton has not been performing badly, merely predictably. True, he got all starry-eyed at being a Cabinet member in the short-lived coalition, but at least he's kept up pressure in the Commons to bail out the auto sector, and was the first to advocate a national standard for acccessing Employment Insurance.</p>
<p>STEPHEN HARPER PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>C Swamped by a deep recession he didn't see coming, forced to plan for huge deficits and seeming to have lost the shrewd tactician skills that were a key part of his reputation, Mr. Harper's grade reflects the probability he's at the mid-point of his annus horribilis. Despite a strong stand against the Liberal ultimatums last week, he's but a shadow of the guy who bare-knuckled the merged Conservatives to power in 2006. If the polls don't improve by October, he risks being the leader who lost power (and shortly thereafter his job) barely a year after he was re-elected with a very strong minority.</p>
<p>JIM FLAHERTY FINANCE MINISTER</p>
<p>D Sympathy must be spared for a Minister squeezed between a revenue freefall and soaring EI expenses and it's no secret his bizarre fiscal update last fall was tainted by Prime Ministerial meddling. But it's his job to wear the fiscal meltdown, even if nobody else could've done better. He cut taxes and contingency padding at the worst possible moment, rammed through a $3-billion stimulus and raised the deficit to $50-billion. At least in this report card term, nice guys do finish last--pending, of course, his recovery with the economy.</p>
<p>C+</p>
<p>LISA RAITT NATURAL RESOURCES MINISTER</p>
<p>C+ If you forget the forgetfulness of her former communications aide, who left a tape recorder and documents in media hands, she remains a surprisingly solid rookie in a hot-button portfolio. The Calgary oil patch likes her, no small feat for the Torontoarea Minister, and she's still impressive under fire on the medical isotope mess. She should've immediately apologized for her taped comments on the sexiness of her isotope crisis, but fingers of blame for that delay point to the PMO.</p>
<p>JASON KENNEY IMMIGRATION MINISTER</p>
<p>B This workaholic shamelessly campaigns for Conservative votes through ethnic outreach and immigration permits, which is understandable given the misconception that new Canadians owe their landing rights to earlier Liberal governments. Mr. Kenney's musings about compulsory language training and his desire to focus immigration on skilled labour are popular and his voice is heard and usually heeded around the Cabinet table.</p>
<p>JOHN BAIRD INFRASTRUCTURE/ TRANSPORT MINISTER</p>
<p>B-There is substance here, although it's usually drowned out by the high volume of this political bullhorn. It's his job to deliver the drunken-sailor stimulus spending this government is rolling out, but there are mixed assessments of how successfully that staggering task is being done. Backed by the best staff on the Hill, he's juggling more issues than any other Minister and has yet to drop the ball.</p>
<p>STOCKWELL DAY INTERNATIONAL TRADE MINISTER</p>
<p>A-He continues to perform well as a Minister, which is all the more impressive given his image meltdown from those jet-ski days as the jettisoned Canadian Alliance leader. His bridge-building trip to China was welcome, his lumber industry bailout to combat the "black liquor" pulp mill subsidies in the United States was needed and he's leading the charge against "Buy American" provisions. In Cabinet, this Stock is on the rise.</p>
<p>JAMES MOORE HERITAGE MINISTER</p>
<p>A After losing an in-the-bag majority by offending Quebec over arts funding cuts, the Harper government needed this young, friendly face for cultural damage control. Tirelessly touring galas, festivals and theatre productions singing praises of the arts, his day is not complete without a funding announcement -some of them artsy enough to make a hardened conservative wince. Mr. Moore has been the class act of Cabinet this year.</p>
<p>TONY CLEMENT INDUSTRY MINISTER</p>
<p>C He radiates all-Canadian geek and probably has a better feel for the wireless world than anyone in Cabinet, but his auto-sector bailout was unpopular and may well prove the sort of disaster that makes a Nortel salvage attempt look like a decent investment. And while he aims to wash his hands of the government propping up the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> pension plan, that's exactly what happened-a sleeper decision that set up the feds for endless demands from other ailing plans.</p>
<p>Let's face it.</p>
<p>LAWRENCE CANNON FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER</p>
<p>C+ When global affairs heat up, a guy named Stephen Harper is the Foreign Minister. Mr. Cannon's job is to handle the thankless international duties while staying off the radar screen and this veteran does reasonably well on both those fronts. He projects an uninspired, gaffe-free, colourless persona to the world-which might make the media yearn for former minister Maxime Bernier, but keeps his boss happy.</p>
<p>PETER MACKAY DEFENCE MINISTER</p>
<p>C-Sure, they like him in the military ranks -his new haircut makes him look like your basic battle group major -but he's been short of stellar in delivering the hard goods. Everything from contracts for search-and-rescue planes to support ships and Arctic patrol vessels have been put on delivery slowdown or are on cost overruns. He appears to lack the clout in Cabinet to re-arm his portfolio and has enough restless ambition to have quietly lobbied for a NATO getaway job.</p>
<p>LEONA AGLUKKAQ HEALTH MINISTER</p>
<p>C-This portfolio seemed like a sleepy rookie training ground at last October's swearing-in ceremony. But before you could say "pig pandemic," it was a front-line target of feverish activity. Then came the Chalk River medical isotope crisis. Yikes. On the horizon, a more virulent strain of swine flu. Ms. Aglukkaq has proven to be a decent script reader in public, but she's in over her head when topics stray off her talking points.</p>
<p>PETER VAN LOAN PUBLIC SAFETY MINISTER</p>
<p>C Yes, yes, he knows the material, but this impossible-to-like Minister is considered arrogant by Cabinet colleagues and is loathed by former staff. He's our point man in trying to put the fattening U. S. border on a diet and the government's eyes on terrorist matters, but hasn't yet recorded career-defining successes.</p>
<p>DIANE FINLEY HUMAN RESOURCES MINISTER</p>
<p>B She doesn't exactly radiate empathy for a jobless epidemic depending on her department's Employment Insurance for survival, but she's a solid performer who knows the file and, despite being under constant attack in the Commons, does a reasonable job of defending EI as a hand up, not a handout.</p>
<p>JIM PRENTICE ENVIRONMENT MINISTER</p>
<p>B+ He's no jolly green giant, but he's got a pragmatic streak that recognizes Canada's environmental rules and regulations must dovetail with the Americans, so we'd better join the Obama green parade before it runs us over. Getting a carbon credit market up and running will be a headache and keeping the oil sands flowing into the clean, green U. S. market will be a challenge, but he's earned Mr. Harper's confidence to work on difficult files without supervision.</p>
<p>ROB NICHOLSON JUSTICE MINISTER</p>
<p>B+ The tough face of Conservative law and order allegedly has a sense of humour. I've never seen it. But he's pushed more legislation into the Commons than most other ministers combined. It's his job to keep the base convinced there still is a conservative heart beating in Canada where hard crime does hard time and early parole is the faintest of hopes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Summer camps brace to battle the flu; Ask parents to keep sick children at home to limit possible H1N1 outbreaks</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>785 words</div><div>21 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>With outbreaks of the H1N1 swine flu a real possibility this summer, directors of youth camps across Ontario are urging parents to be straight with counsellors about any medical conditions their children may have, and to keep their young ones at home if they develop flu symptoms.</p>
<p>In many cases, camp directors are taking extra precautions to screen campers for signs of illness -- coughing, fever, diarrhea, vomiting -- in the hope of minimizing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>"I would hope that logic would prevail, and parents would not send their children to camp if something has developed," said Jeff Brown, director of Camp Otterdale near Perth, which hosts up to 600 children every summer.</p>
<p>The camp is prepared to send those who are sick back home, said Brown. Those who fall sick while at camp would be referred to onsite medical staff, who would determine whether they should be isolated or sent home. "We would treat it like any other flu," said Brown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, poised for a surge in flu patients, is developing a plan to ensure it has enough staff to deal with what has traditionally been a summer lull.</p>
<p>"Summer is typically a quiet time and the hospital's staffing levels go down," said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health. "I know that they've been starting to think about whether there needs to be a disruption to previously planned vacation scheduling."</p>
<p>The novel strain of the H1N1 virus has tended to infect large numbers of otherwise healthy children and teens, meaning CHEO's emergency room has been busier than expected with an increased number of patients exhibiting flu symptoms.</p>
<p>"CHEO, more than any of the other (Ottawa-area) hospitals, has really been at the brink of needing to bring forward different kinds of plans to deal with the surge and demand, especially in the emergency room," Levy said.</p>
<p>And as the school year winds down and children prepare to spend weeks in the wilderness, public-health officials are gearing up to deal with potential outbreaks at summer camps.</p>
<p>Levy said while his staff are prepared to track the virus by relying on reports from camps, it's unclear what the numbers would reveal. "What's going to be very hard to know is, is this pattern really different than other years, when no one got around to telling us?"</p>
<p>The Ontario Camps Association, which represents day and overnight camps attended by 350,000 children annually, has sent an e-mail to its 350 members warning that summer camps have the potential to be a "breeding ground" for the virus.</p>
<p>"Most kids who get sick at camp haven't gotten sick because of something they caught at camp. It's something that they've already brought in," said Aruna Ogale, the association's executive director. "Somebody comes to camp ill and then, it gets spread around."</p>
<p>As a result, the association has urged its member camps, such as those run by the YMCA, B'nai Brith Ottawa, Christie Lake Kids and Camp Otterdale, among others, to report to the association and to public-health officials any time they see three or more cases of the flu within a four-day period.</p>
<p>"One of the things that we would start doing is issue alerts to other camps in the province and track if other camps have it," Ogale said. "When you think about the fact that camps are getting kids from out of area, you could be importing the illness from one area to another."</p>
<p>Camps accredited with the association must follow provincially-recommended guidelines to ensure they have on-site nurses, doctors and first-aid staff, as well as facilities to isolate campers and staff who fall sick. Beyond that, extra infection-control measures are expected to be enforced this summer, including installing more hand-sanitizing stations, ensuring common areas such as bathrooms are cleaned regularly and screening campers for flu-related symptoms.</p>
<p>This is particularly important for children who have underlying medical conditions that could either weaken their immune systems, making them more susceptible to the virus, or increase their risk of developing life-threatening complications if they get sick.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, parents aren't as forthcoming as they could be about their children's health conditions because they think that maybe they'll be turned away," said Ogale. "So this year, more than any other time, it's really important to be straightforward about any medications or any underlying conditions that camp directors should know about."</p>

<p>A Spanish cruise ship was turned away from three Caribbean islands after swine flu cases emerged among the crew and the 800-odd passengers finally got off in Aruba, the tour operator said Saturday.</p>
<p>The Ocean Dream docked in Aruba late Friday after being denied entry in Grenada, Saint Lucia and Barbados, Pullmantur said. Three swine flu cases were reported among the crew but the passengers were unaffected. The ship's nine-day cruise through the Caribbean was hampered by the flu outbreak and the ship could not dock at three destinations on the itinerary.</p>
<p>The A(H1N1) virus has infected more than 44,000 people around the world, resulting in 180 deaths since late March, WHO figures show.</p>

<p>Step Closer, by tessa mcwatt (Harper-Collins, 338 pages, $32.99)</p>
<p>One of the main characters in Tessa McWatt's latest novel is a young scientist doing research on swine viruses. Given that Step Closer would have been completed long before the recent outbreak of swine flu in Mexico, one wonders if McWatt has a crystal ball. Coincidence? Who knows.</p>
<p>In any case, there is a lot more than prescient scientific research going on in this sprawling and complex work, whose themes include identity, belonging, self-knowledge, guilt, atonement, borders, language, history and migration. Indeed, with such a variety of weighty themes, some may wonder if the writer's reach exceeds her grasp, but I'm happy to report that, a few rough patches aside, McWatt tames this turbulent tale with an efficiency that the World Health Organization could only envy.</p>
<p>The heroine of Step Closer is Emily, a 30-something Canadian who lives in Spain with her boyfriend, Sam, the virus researcher. The 2004 tsunami has just caused mass destruction in Southeast Asia; it has also galvanized Emily's desire to excavate her past and come to deeper self-knowledge. To do this, she begins to write a story about two men who played a major role in her life.</p>
<p>The first is Marcus, an enigmatic and beautiful young black man, who was Emily's platonic roommate and fellow waiter at a bar in Pamplona. The second is Gavin Lake, an Englishman who arrives in Pamplona in a disoriented state -- looking, we learn, to atone to Marcus for some wicked event. Soon after they meet, Gavin and Marcus embark on a pilgrimage on the Santiago de Compostela trail, or the Way of St. James, as pilgrims have done for more than 1,000 years. For reasons of her own, Emily intercepts them en route, and lives are changed as a result.</p>
<p>In the end, Emily decides that writing about life is not the same as living it, leading to a glorious declaration of personal progress that involves bulls, Vaseline and public nudity. But it's not what you might think.</p>
<p>McWatt, whose 2001 novel Dragon's Cry was nominated for a Governor General's Award, is a talented writer who has set herself a monumental task in this wide-ranging novel, with its subplots, shifts between past and present, and complicated cast of characters. For the temporal shifts, McWatt has Emily relate the past as a diary entry in which she herself plays a role, a device that works for the most part, although occasionally it comes off as contrived.</p>
<p>Despite McWatt's steady hand, though, there are some annoying aspects to this novel. For example, we discover that Marcus and Gavin both attended a British reform school years before, and that something monumental and horrible happened there. We know it was monumental and horrible because the author keeps telling us so, a heavy-handed narrative device so overused that the revelation of the actual event falls a little flat.</p>
<p>McWatt also is given to occasional fits of writerly preciousness--such as ending sentences with portentous single words. Like. This. And though the plot is complicated, the novel could have been at least 50 pages shorter, and fewer readers would be driven to wonder when the writer was going to get to get to the point.</p>
<p>Quibbles aside, McWatt writes with sensitivity and passion, and as a transplanted Guyanese who moved to Canada and then to Britain, she writes convincingly of the experience of the exotic other. This alone would make Step Closer a satisfying summer read.</p>

<p>Algeria's health ministry yesterday confirmed the country's first swine flu case in an Algerian woman arriving from Miami earlier in the week. Laboratory tests confirmed the H1N1 virus in the woman, who arrived in Algeria on Tuesday on a Lufthansa flight from Miami via Frankfurt, the state APS news agency quoted the ministry as saying. The woman was travelling with her two children, who were also receiving precautionary care. -- AFP</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 also affects the perfectly healthy</b>
</div><div>Helen Branswell </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>782 words</div><div>20 June 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record. </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Whether speaking of a 58-year-old man or a 38-year-old woman or a little boy of nine, officials announcing H1N1 flu deaths are almost always quick to note "underlying health conditions'' may have contributed to the fatal outcome.</p>
<p>Asthma, heart disease, diabetes, maybe even obesity are among the conditions used to help explain why H1N1 flu infection is hospitalizing and killing younger people, people who would be expected to make a full recovery from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>It could create the impression that only the sickly are dying from the new H1N1 flu virus -- a claim no one is making.</p>
<p>To the contrary, many, including the World Health Organization, say between one-third and one-half of H1N1 flu deaths have occurred in people who were previously healthy.</p>
<p>But how healthy is previously healthy? The answer depends on whom you ask.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar is a critical care specialist who has been treating H1N1 flu cases in embattled intensive care units in several Winnipeg hospitals.</p>
<p>He says a small portion of the ICU patients look like flu's typical victims, people with health conditions know to be badly exacerbated by a bout of influenza. But more are younger and -- until they got sick -- healthier than flu patients hospitals typically see during a regular influenza season.</p>
<p>"For the most part, these young, relatively healthy people aren't marathon runners or anything like that," he admits.</p>
<p>"They're normal people . . . . If you asked them 'Are you healthy?' they'd say 'Yeah, pretty healthy.' "</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam, head of infectious disease prevention and control for Ontario's public health agency, believes the constant refrain of "underlying conditions" bespeaks a sort of wishful thinking, an attempt to explain away the unusual age range of the people the new virus is sending to hospital or to the morgue.</p>
<p>"That's the story that I think people haven't really registered,'' says Gardam. "We're clinging to these 'Oh, they had underlying illness, therefore it's OK.' "</p>
<p>"But . . . I would argue that the 30-year-old with mild asthma -- how big of an underlying illness is that compared to again the 80-year-old person with bad lung disease from smoking, who's got heart disease?</p>
<p>"That's the usual group that unfortunately gets really sick with flu, not this healthy adult group."</p>
<p>You'll find little argument that this virus, at this time, is causing more severe disease in people far younger than those normally hospitalized and killed by flu or its complications in a typical flu season.</p>
<p>"This is not a disease of older adults. There's no question,'' says Dr. Allison McGeer, an influenza expert with Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"For people under 50, this is a significantly more severe disease than seasonal flu. For people over 50, it's much better,'' she notes.</p>
<p>But are the people under 50 who are being badly hit by the virus specimens of perfect health or are many of them already shaded by the broad umbrella known as "pre-existing health conditions''?</p>
<p>How you view a condition like asthma -- seen in 41 per cent of the hospitalized cases in New York City -- may influence how you answer that question.</p>
<p>"A lot of that is about labelling people,'' McGeer admits.</p>
<p>"Half of me doesn't want you to think you're diseased if you have asthma, and the other half of me wants you to get your flu vaccine because you're at increased risk.</p>
<p>"How do you walk that line?''</p>
<p>Year in and year out, public health authorities get plenty of evidence many people who have some health issues plunk themselves firmly on the "healthy'' side of the divide.</p>
<p>RISK FACTORS</p>
<p>Lung conditions: Flu is tough on people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or COPD. Likewise asthma -- 41 per cent of hundreds of hospitalized H1N1 flu patients in New York City were asthma sufferers.</p>
<p>Heart disease, diabetes and diseases that compromise the immune system: People with these conditions have a harder time fighting off flu.</p>
<p>Pregnancy: It's not an illness, but a time when a woman's immune system must strike a fine balance between protecting her and not rejecting the foreign tissue she's carrying. Past pandemics have been hard on pregnant women.</p>
<p>Smoking: Anything that weakens the lungs makes flu a more dangerous foe.</p>
<p>Obesity: Obesity is on the table as a potential complication with H1N1 flu. Doctors say they are seeing more obese people among severe cases. Some say it's just the morbidly obese, others say even people 20 or 30 pounds overweight seem harder hit.</p>

</p>
<p>A Regina man and his girlfriend's plans for a seven-day junket in China while en route home from Australia took an unexpected twist on Monday.</p>
<p>Reginan Brian Ballman and Vania Gamache, from Quesnel, B.C., who have been globetrotting for nearly three years, were quarantined upon arrival in Shanghai airport on Monday after one of their flight mates, who was running a fever, tested positive for the H1N1 virus. The quarantine was for seven days.</p>
<p>"The people are nice and we are getting looked after but by no means (is this) the experience of China we wanted," Ballman wrote in an e-mail to the Leader-Post.</p>
<p>Instead of walking the Great Wall of China and touring the Forbidden City, the couple, who are not allowed to leave their hotel, are walking the fourth-floor hallways at the Baineng Hotel, browsing the Internet and flipping channels looking for English TV newscasts.</p>
<p>"We play cards, eat at 8, 12, and 6 (when hotel staff hand out food) with two temperature readings daily, and have been chatting with a Swedish traveller, who is on her way home as well but travelling alone, so this has been tough to take,'' Ballman wrote.</p>
<p>In an attempt to contain the spread of the H1N1 virus, Chinese health authorities, who routinely check passengers for signs they may be ill, identified two passengers on Ballman's flight who were running fevers. They ordered further testing and decided to quarantine three rows of passengers in front and behind these people. The rest of the passengers were allowed to go.</p>
<p>"Not so lucky for us, we were in that area and were advised we would not be going to Beijing (that night). It was very subjective who got to go and who had to stay especially after 10 hours in the air. We all could have been affected,'' Ballman wrote.</p>
<p>The Canadian couple, along with about 40 other passengers, were detained at the airport and eventually transported to a hotel to await test results. They finally got word one passenger tested positive for H1N1 flu. Health authorities imposed a seven-day quarantine. Ballman hopes they'll be able to leave Monday.</p>
<p>"It is very boring, frustrating and tough to take, but we manage.''</p>
<p>After cancelling the Beijing trip and rescheduling their flight home, Ballman wrote that this is just one more story to tell when they finally get home.</p>

<p>A s Calgary experiences a spike in H1N1 flu cases, a local school is reporting two more students are ill with the virus.</p>
<p>There were 24 more confirmed H1N1 cases reported in the Calgary area Friday, including some at Edgemont School, said Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health at Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>"We have seen a significant increase in cases reported to us in this past week . . . It's across the board in terms of ages and it's not just in schools," MacDonald said.</p>
<p>As of Friday, Alberta had 498 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza including 139 from the Calgary area.</p>
<p>The majority of cases in Calgary are mild illnesses.</p>
<p>MacDonald couldn't say why there was a rise in H1N1 in Calgary at this time, but indicated increased public awareness and more doctors testing for it could be factors.</p>
<p>On Friday, two mild cases of H1N1 flu were confirmed at Edgemont School, said Calgary Board of Education spokesman Ted Flitton.</p>
<p>"The health authority has been working quite closely with us and we're monitoring the situation, hourly in some cases," said Flitton.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, up to 70 students were absent from Edgemont School for various reasons, though the number of absences was cut in half by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Two Edgemont School students were tested for H1N1 after experiencing serious symptoms, but were found to have a viral infection, said Flitton.</p>
<p>Even before the H1N1 cases were confirmed, Edgemont School was thoroughly disinfected. It was to be cleaned again Friday, he said.</p>
<p>Since this new flu strain appeared in the Calgary-area in April, there have been 19 schools with confirmed cases of the illness, said MacDonald.</p>
<p>Some schools have had a single case, or a couple cases. But there have been four schools where a cluster of cases were reported, she said.</p>
<p>"We have an outbreak surveillance system for any kind of illness in schools. Whenever there is more than 10 per cent of the school population (students and staff) away, then the school administration contacts the school nurse to report this and we investigate it further," she said.</p>
<p>An increased absence rate at Edgemont prompted select testing of students by Alberta Health Services, MacDonald said, adding the regular seasonal flu is also lingering and brings the same symptoms.</p>

<p>While the H1N1 flu has quietly dropped off the daily headlines, the potential of the pandemic returning with increased vigour is never far away.</p>
<p>Calgary churches are being asked to step forward and prepare to play a role in case the flu roars back this fall to hit large segments of the population.</p>
<p>marg Pollon, who leads Calgary's Bridges of love ministry, has spent the last four years building links between the emergency management and Christian communities. the result has been the creation of the regional Faith Community emergency Preparedness Coalition.</p>
<p>"the church community has a moral, ethical and spiritual obligation to stand in the gap if a pandemic or any other disaster which might come our way," says Pollon.</p>
<p>"It seems like we've been given a grace period to get our act together in terms of H1n1. But we know pandemics seem to come in waves and it could return this fall with a vengeance," she adds.</p>
<p>to that end, Calgary's church community has been divided into the city's four quadrants, with a designated lead church to co-ordinate preparations in each area.</p>
<p>a planning meeting for the northeast quadrant is set for 1:30 p. m. on June 24 at Crossroads Community Church, 912 19 st. n. e., the lead church for the northeast.</p>
<p>"we want to build a comprehensive database with details of which churches have what particular expertise and a list of volunteers if we're called on to help emergency authorities deal with a big pandemic," says Pollon.</p>
<p>meetings in the three other quadrants will be announced in coming weeks.</p>
<p>more information on the program is available by calling Pollon at 403-263-5683.</p>

</p>
<p>The provincial Health Department reported 35 new confirmed cases of H1N1 in Manitoba on Friday, bringing the total to 295.</p>
<p>Of those confirmed cases, 145 are Winnipeggers, with most of the remainder from the northern regional health authorities of Burntwood and Churchill (82) and Nor-Man (22).</p>
<p>The government also said Friday that it has distributed a bulletin to schools, businesses, child care centres and other organizations on precautions regarding influenza.</p>
<p>The province said it has provided hand sanitizer to four northern communities. The product was distributed by the federal government. Hand-washing is the most important practice to prevent the spread of infection, the government said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the province said Friday that its call to action for health-care workers in northern Manitoba is continuing. Two additional doctors will be working in northern communities this weekend. The Manitoba government said it is working with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC), the northern chiefs organization Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) and Ottawa to provide training sessions for First Nations emergency managers.</p>
<p>If Manitobans are experiencing flu-like symptoms and need advice or care, they should contact their health-care provider or call Health Links-at 788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free), the province said.</p>

<div>THE CASE FOR VACCINATION</div>
<div>Comment</div>
<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 / 6,000 DEATHS / THE PANDEMIC IS HERE; Those who dismiss H1N1 as a panic-fest are profoundly wrong – even the mild version in a country like Canada could kill thousands. And the nightmare scenario? That would be really scary</b>

</p>
<p>British science writer and broadcaster</p>
<p>So it's here at last. After months of will-it-won't-it anticipation, H1N1 officially went pandemic on June 11.</p>
<p>Yet despite increasing numbers of cases in over 70 countries, many still think it a fuss over nothing: “What's the big deal? It's just ordinary flu.” It is worrying that even Canadians are saying this, although they know from recent memory what it is to experience a big disease outbreak.</p>
<p>Many in Britain are saying the same thing. One high-profile commentator, Simon Jenkins in the Guardian newspaper, asserted that swine flu was a panic stoked in order “to posture and spend,” saying that health scares such as this enable media-hungry doctors, public-health officials and drug companies to benefit by manipulating fright.</p>
<p>Those who dismiss H1N1 as a panic-fest are profoundly wrong. This “ordinary flu” might have real consequences to many Canadians.</p>
<p>Canada has an excellent flu vaccination program and good access to medical care. Nonetheless, 6,000 to 8,000 Canadians die of seasonal flu each year, mostly older people or those with other health problems. These are people's mothers and grandfathers, uncles and fathers. Ordinary flu causes a great many deaths, even in a country such as Canada.</p>
<p>Let's say that H1N1 continues to be mild and is no worse than seasonal flu. “Mild” means having up to five days feeling really unwell with fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches, and then a further week before one feels able to return to work and normal life.</p>
<p>The old story about the difference between flu and a cold holds good: If a $50 bill is dropped outside your front door, if you've got a cold, you'll go pick it up; if you've got flu, not even $50 will get you out of bed.</p>
<p>This is a novel flu. While people over 50 seem to have some immunity, perhaps because of the Asian flu of 1957, those who are younger have not been exposed before and have no defences in place. Current H1N1 attack rates are about 20 per cent. That is, one in five people exposed to this new flu will come down with symptoms like the ones above; exposure can result from merely touching a surface where there are viruses, because someone else has touched it. Pretty much everyone who comes into contact with other people will be exposed to this flu, sooner or later.</p>
<p>4-PER-CENT IMPACT ON GDP</p>
<p>That means 20 per cent of the population becoming sick, with perhaps another 10 per cent of the working population home looking after them. Think about the effects on business, on transport, on day-to-day life, of so many people being off sick at the same time. Flu is estimated to have a 4-per-cent impact on a country's GDP.</p>
<p>And think about its effect on hospitals. Not on its effect on patients requiring intensive care, but its effect on staffing. A tanker drivers' strike in Britain bought our hospitals to a halt in less than a week. Why? Because schools didn't have fuel for heating and were closed, working mothers had to stay home to look after their children. Where are there are large proportion of working mothers? In nursing and allied health services.</p>
<p>There are 33 million people in Canada. At an attack rate of 20 per cent, six million people would develop flu. The death rate in Canada is currently tiny, at roughly 0.1 per cent (12 deaths, 4,905 cases). But 0.1 per cent of six million is 6,000. These 6,000 will not be just the old and the sick, whose deaths, extraordinarily, don't seem to greatly concern many commentators, but will include previously healthy twentysomethings (such as three of those admitted to intensive care units in Britain), pregnant women and a disproportionate number of those sections of the population that are genetically particularly susceptible. Such effects are already appearing in Canada with outbreaks of severe illness among previously healthy native people in Manitoba.</p>
<p>This is not scaremongering. This is reality.</p>
<p>Many people expect that all medical staff will turn up for work during a flu pandemic. Toronto's experience of SARS in 2003 shows that they won't, and cannot be made to do so. Many of them won't be able to, because they are looking after family at home, and some will fear catching flu and its effects. Normal hospital schedules will grind to a halt, meaning that far fewer elective procedures such as hip replacements and heart surgery can take place. It will inevitably cause deaths that should have been preventable. This is without the strain on services from many more people requiring respiratory support because of flu.</p>
<p>So why couldn't the hospital authorities make flu vaccines mandatory for health-care staff when they become available? Britain does not make this mandatory, and only 13 per cent of National Health Service Staff front-line staff voluntarily had seasonal flu vaccination in 2008-2009. Why? It's principally because staff think of flu as “ordinary,” not something that causes severe illness. Recently, unvaccinated NHS staff were shown by Britain's Health Protection Agency to have been the cause of a major outbreak of flu among patients who were already critically ill in a hospital in Liverpool.</p>
<p>When people look upon the threat to themselves as “mild,” they will not consider vaccination, which they feel has greater risks than the illness.</p>
<p>Playing in the background are current attitudes to vaccines, coloured by the long-running contention that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism, but also by the experience of swine flu in the United States in 1976.</p>
<p>THE FORT DIX PRECEDENT</p>
<p>In January, 1976, scores of army recruits at Fort Dix, N.J., complained of flu symptoms – not unusual at that time of year. But 18-year old Private David Lewis, with the bravado of youth, decided to ignore medical advice to go to bed; he went out on a strenuous all-night exercise in the bitter cold. At the end of the exercise, he collapsed. He died a few hours later. An autopsy revealed that his death was caused by a previously unknown variant of swine flu A/H1N1. But what really spooked the Centers for Disease Control was its similarity to the strain that had killed more than 40 million people across the world in 1918.</p>
<p>The CDC rightly decided to develop a swine-flu vaccine for use in the following flu season. But there were many production problems. It was on the point of being cancelled, when there was an outbreak of fatal pneumonia after the Pennsylvania convention of the American Legion. The media linked it with swine flu (although today it is known to have been what is called legionnaires' disease), and politicians joined in the clamour to push forward the swine-flu vaccination program.</p>
<p>The threat from swine flu was vastly exaggerated in the media, although it was already clear that the outbreak (which involved no more than 300 people) was over. President Gerald Ford took personal charge of a mass vaccination program, and it had deadly consequences.</p>
<p>With all manufacturing capacity devoted to swine flu, seasonal flu production stopped. That year, there was a particularly virulent strain of seasonal flu, and there were thousands more regular flu deaths than normal, largely in unvaccinated seniors. There was also the problem of vaccine side effects.</p>
<p>SIDE EFFECTS BECOME NUMEROUS</p>
<p>When millions of people are vaccinated, very rare side effects become numerous. About nine in every million of those vaccinated then developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, a paralytic disease. There were 500 cases and 25 deaths.</p>
<p>The batches may have been contaminated with a bacterium. In any case, the vaccination program was stopped, having only treated 24 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>This is not then. There are already thousands of cases, and vaccine technology is better than it was. But no vaccine is absolutely safe. There will be very rare side effects with new H1N1 vaccines too, and most have not yet been tested on children, who are one of the groups that are most likely to be vaccinated as a priority, because they seem to be especially affected. But people can only ever see risk from their own perspective.</p>
<p>It seems probable that, despite knowing that 6,000 or more Canadians might be prevented from dying and tens of thousands more prevented from having serious illness, people will concentrate on their own individual risks, with many choosing to remain unvaccinated. This places individuals at risk but also friends, family and loved ones and those who are unable to be vaccinated for one reason or another.</p>
<p>All this comes from a mild illness that many people think is not a risk and claim to be overhyped. Everyone should think again about the seriousness of pandemic flu.</p>
<p>Let us hope that the nightmare scenario of a new virus with the virulence of H5N1 (bird flu) and the transmissibility if H1N1 does not come to pass. That really would be scary.</p>

</p>
<p>The pounding shook the front door so hard that pictures rattled on the hallway walls. "Let me in!" demanded the muffled voice outside.</p>
<p>"Go away," I shouted back, jamming the chair even more tightly under the knob. "I'm calling 9-1-1!"</p>
<p>"C'mon, Dad," pleaded the voice. "It's freezing out here."</p>
<p>"No way," I replied. "You have swine flu. It's a global pandemic now. I already burned your clothes."</p>
<p>"I don't have swine flu," she said. "I have hay fever."</p>
<p>Well, maybe she did, maybe she didn't, but I wasn't about to take the chance. If that makes me a bad dad, what else is new? On the Parent-O-Meter I tilt closer to Homer Simpson than Howard Cunningham.</p>
<p>My record speaks for itself. When she was born, I described her as being the size of "a nice coho." I was golfing when she broke her arm. Stole her Halloween candy until she got old and wise enough to catalogue it. Cheered the wrong kid at a swim meet (they all look the same in cap and goggles). Forgot to pick her up at the airport once. A couple of years ago she blundered into a Tour de Rock event in a mall and found me singing karaoke, in spandex, in public. It was the worst single moment of her life. ("Introduce me to your friends!" I cried.)</p>
<p>Not that I'm the worst father ever. Last year a U.S. soldier fighting overseas was nailed with a big credit card bill after his dad stole his ID. An Oklahoma man was arrested after leaving his four kids -- aged three months to seven years -- in the car while he went for a 1 a.m. lap dance in a Tulsa strip club. Marvin Gaye's father killed his son with the gun the singer had given him as a gift.</p>
<p>Right, gifts. That's what I'm supposed to be writing about today. It's Father's Day coming up. Time to get dad a present, preferably one he won't shoot you with.</p>
<p>The papers are full of gift suggestions this week. CanWest's Iris Winston wrote a piece detailing the worst Father's Day ideas, including anything that implies criticism, such as odour eaters or diet books. "Most of all, ditch generic gifts," she wrote. "The popular wisdom may suggest that the thought counts more than the gift itself, but any gift shrugged off simply to fulfill an obligation without thinking about the person's taste and interests will fall flat." Can't deny that: Nothing brings a tear to dad's eye like a present that says "you might have given me life, but I really have no idea who you are."</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum are those gifts that reflect an unreasonably optimistic ideal. My daughter once gave me a tie on which she had painted "number one dad." Although disturbed by her serious lack of judgment, I was quite touched, even wore the tie to a funeral. "You're not the number one dad," said the guy in the next pew. "I am now," I replied, nodding at the coffin.</p>
<p>The guy had a point though. Six billion people in the world, there's no way I'm the best father. Top 10, maybe. Number four, tops. But number one? Let's get real. Giving me a "number one dad" tie is like giving me a hairbrush. It's one thing to be hopeful, another to be delusional.</p>
<p>What they need is a line of gifts for mediocre fathers, the ones who aren't Alec-Baldwin-screaming-in-the-telephone abusive, but aren't exactly Waltons/Cosby/Seventh Heaven material either. The middling kind of dads who show up for the dance recital, but only if the teacher is hot, who read bedtime stories, but only those written by Tom Clancy. The kind who walk her down the aisle, but miss the first waltz because there's a TV in the next room and the Canucks are on a power play.</p>
<p>For those fathers, you should be able to buy a coffee cup that says 60th Percentile Dad! or a T-shirt that reads Not The Best, But Never Dangled Me Off a Balcony Like Michael Jackson, Either.</p>
<p>Home-made presents are the best. (Unless they're improvised explosive devices. Then they're bad.) Put together a photo album of all the special occasions he missed (championship game, grad, sentencing) or bake him a cake in the shape of a big C+.</p>
<p>But if you have swine flu, just leave it at the door.</p>

</p>
<p>The number of cases of H1N1 influenza continues to climb in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>As of June 17, 381 people in the province had tested positive for the virus, according to the Saskatchewan Health website. That's 160 more than a week earlier when, on June 10, 221 cases had been identified by the Saskatchewan Disease Control Laboratory.</p>
<p>More than 95 per cent of those who have tested positive for the virus have had no signs of severe symptoms.</p>
<p>The province's website does not break down the latest numbers by health region.</p>
<p>"Showing the number of positive results in a given health region could wrongly give the impression that the risk of infection is greater in that region. In fact, it would only show that more testing is taking place in that region," says the website.</p>
<p>The government is asking doctors to discontinue testing for the virus when patients display mild symptoms.</p>

<p>Re: The WHO's Fabricated Pandemic, Michael Fumento, June 19.</p>
<p>I get it. The media, including the National Post, has done a poor job of relating what is actually happening in regards to swine flu, or has gone for more of the fearful aspects of this story. Now, in light of the fact that some people feel this is not an issue or are tired of this story, you print this column.</p>
<p>Michael Fumento is right, in some regards. The disease is not the killer it has been made out to be. I am certainly not going to fault the World Health Organization (WHO) for that; it deserves some credit for at least attacking the situation head on. If the media made this situation overly dramatic and reported every press conference as though it might be the last, who's fault is that?</p>
<p>What if swine flu did kill more people than the seasonal flu Mr. Fumento seems so attached to? Would he revisit his argument on these pages or would he be too busy leading the mob to stone the WHO?</p>
<p>And how many deaths is too many? Mr. Fumento mentions SARS and AIDS as though they are not large problems. Honestly, one death is one too many.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health agency muzzled, opposition claims - Question its freedom in listeriosis outbreak</b>
</div><div>By Mia Rabson </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- In a parliamentary report on the listeriosis outbreak of 2008, opposition parties called Thursday for increased independence of the Winnipeg-based Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>The Liberals and NDP say the agency was sidelined during the crisis, and needs to be given independent powers.</p>
<p>The opposition parties want a full public inquiry on the outbreak. Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, the former health minister, said she hopes the inquiry will help determine how to create "a truly independent Public Health Agency of Canada with a chief public health officer who can speak to Canadians without any threat of political intervention, interference or blockage."</p>
<p>The opposition parties admitted they had no evidence of it but still said they heard allegations that political interference may have played a role in the limited communication from the public health agency.</p>
<p>Bennett said when she watched Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones during the listeriosis crisis, "it did not seem like he was allowed to do his job."</p>
<p>NDP MP Malcolm Allen said it seemed to him it was <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span>President Michael McCain giving Canadians all the information rather than Butler-Jones, who should be the face of public health to Canadians during an outbreak.</p>
<p>He said in the recent H1N1 influenza outbreak, Butler-Jones has been far more visible than he was during listeriosis.</p>
<p>"I don't know what happened last year," said Allen, adding that's why a public inquiry is necessary.</p>
<p>The recommendations for a public inquiry and a more independent public health agency came in a report from a subcommittee of the House of Commons agriculture committee that looked at the listeriosis outbreak that killed 22 people last year after a <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span> plant became contaminated with the bacteria.</p>
<p>The committee, however, produced two reports: one from the opposition parties, who hold a majority of seats on the committee, and a second, dissenting report and recommendations from the Conservative members of the committee who felt the majority report was not accurate or fair.</p>
<p>The Conservatives' dissenting report pointed out Butler-Jones testified before the committee there was no influence from the prime minister, his office or any cabinet ministers or their offices</p>
<p>"No one gave me direction about what information to provide, what questions to answer, how to answer questions, or what actions to take, from the Public Health Agency," Butler-Jones said. "No one. If they had, I would have resisted it."</p>
<p>He said he would have resigned if the prime minister's office or anyone else told him what to say.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq noted Butler-Jones' testimony in responding to the opposition suggestions Thursday.</p>
<p>"It's important for government departments and agencies to be accountable to democratically elected representatives," said Josée Bellemare.</p>

</p>
<p>At least 81 U.S. health care workers have contracted laboratory-confirmed cases of the novel H1N1 influenza virus, and about half caught the bug on the job, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.</p>
<p>The finding is worrisome because it suggests that hospitals and workers are not taking sufficient preventive measures to limit spread of the virus.</p>
<p>If a large-scale outbreak recurs this fall, a similar infection rate could cause significant problems -- not only because it would limit the number of workers available to care for the sick, but also because the infected nurses, doctors and others could transmit the virus to debilitated patients before their own symptoms become apparent.</p>
<p>Already-ill patients would be more likely to develop life-threatening side effects from the flu.</p>
<p>The report in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report studied only 48 cases that occurred from the beginning of April to May 13, and concluded that "probably half were related to the health-care setting," said Dr. Michael Bell of the CDC's Center for Preparedness, Detection & Control of Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>An additional 33 cases have been observed since then, but not studied in depth.</p>
<p>One of the key findings of the study, he said, is that potential patients with so-called swine flu "need to be identified at the front door" of the hospital so that personnel will know they need to take preventive measures, such as wearing masks, isolating the patients and paying particular attention to hand hygiene.</p>
<p>It is also "absolutely essential that health care personnel be vaccinated annually, for their own protection and to protect patients in hospitals," he added.</p>
<p>The agency is not recommending that all hospital personnel receive the antiviral drug Tamiflu but that it be used prophylactically in personnel who have been exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>Agency officials are mildly surprised that the new flu virus is continuing its spread in the summer months, well after the normal end of the flu season.</p>
<p>To date, there have been more than 17,800 laboratory-confirmed cases in the United States, with 1,600 patients hospitalized and 44 deaths, according to Dr. Daniel Jernigan, an epidemiologist in the CDC's influenza division.</p>
<p>Worldwide, there have been nearly 40,000 confirmed cases in 88 countries. In the U.S., the spread appears to be tapering off throughout most of the country.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has not had any reported cases of flu transmission by health care workers, an official said.</p>

<div>SMALL DOSES / STUDY / ANTI-AGING</div>

<div id="hd"><b>Cancer free – smoother skin too</b>

<p>Acream normally used to prevent skin cancer also bestows a more youthful appearance – smoothing wrinkles and fading unsightly age spots, according to a new study.</p>
<p>If further tests confirm the promising findings, the cream could turn out to be the next rage among aging baby boomers looking for new ways to reverse the ravages of time.</p>
<p>The prescription ointment, known by the generic name fluorouracil, is currently used to treat actinic keratoses, skin lesions that can develop into a common form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. The cream has been on the market for four decades.</p>
<p>Many patients have commented that their skin appears smoother and softer after treatment.</p>
<p>So researchers at the University of Michigan's medical school near Ann Arbor conducted a small study to gauge the cream's potential as a fountain of youth in a tube. The team, led by Dana Sachs, recruited 21 healthy volunteers with minor actinic keratoses lesions and sun-damaged skin. The patients, aged 56 to 85, put the medicated cream on their faces twice a day for two weeks. Dermatologists measured skin changes and took biopsies.</p>
<p>“The skin gets very red, it gets inflamed and starts to peel,” she said. “It can become swollen for some people and it can be kind of tender.”</p>
<p>The cream essentially irritates the skin, setting in motion a natural wound-healing process. Results from the study, published in Archives of Dermatology, suggest the body is producing new collagen to rebuild damaged skin.</p>
<p>It appears to work in the same way as other cosmetic skin treatments such as chemical peels, microdermabrasion and certain laser therapies that can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Other anti-aging treatments may produce better results than the cream. But fluorouracil has one big advantage – it's relatively cheap, costing about $50 a tube from online pharmacies, she noted.</p>
<p>The study was partly funded by <span class="companylink">Valeant Pharmaceuticals</span>, which produces a brand-name version of the cream called Efudex. Dr. Sachs said the firm had no say in how the study was conducted or the conclusions. Furthermore, she suspects a generic product would work just as well as the brand.</p>
<p>But with any of these cosmetic treatments, “there is a price to pay for looking better,” she cautions. “I tell patients you're going to look terrible for a few weeks,” as the irritated skin goes through the healing process.</p>
<p>FLU DRUGS IN PREGNANCY</p>
<p>A drug-safety review suggests pregnant women and nursing mothers can take anti-flu drugs without causing harm to their children.</p>
<p>With the H1N1 swine flu now considered to be a pandemic, researchers at the Motherisk Program at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and the Drug Information Institute in Pregnancy in Tokyo joined forces to evaluate two medications used to prevent and treat influenza – Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir).</p>
<p>Pregnant women are at an elevated risk of suffering complications from the flu. So there's good reason to have treatment options.</p>
<p>Neither drug appears to affect the normal growth and development of the fetus, according to the findings published online this week by the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledge that safety evidence is limited because drug trials are seldom conducted on pregnant women. Among other data, they reviewed physician reports to the drug makers and a previously unreported study.</p>
<p>Tamiflu “appears to be the drug of choice because there are more data on its safety in pregnancy,” Shinya Ito, part of the Sick Kids team, said in a statement released with the study.</p>
<p>In particular, an unpublished Japanese study followed 90 women who took Tamiflu during the first trimester of pregnancy, when birth defects are most likely to occur. The results showed they were no more likely to have a child with a birth defect than women in general.</p>
<p>Only small amounts of Tamiflu and Relenza end up in mother's milk. That suggests either drug would be suitable for nursing moms.</p>
<p>TRANSPLANT PATIENT DIES</p>
<p>One of the first patients in the world to receive a face transplant has died during a second operation to treat an infection, French medical authorities reported this week.</p>
<p>The unnamed patient had been horribly disfigured in an accident several years ago. On April 4, French surgeons replaced the patient's entire face above the lips – including the scalp and ears – with tissue from a dead donor. At the same time, the patient also received a new pair of hands.</p>
<p>All transplant patients are given immune-system suppressing drugs to prevent rejection of the donated tissue. But that leaves them vulnerable to infection.</p>
<p>The patient suffered heart failure on June 8 as doctors performed an operation to deal with a “common postoperative infection,” according to news reports from Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>Despite the death, French officials said it's worth proceeding with revolutionary face-transplant operations that hold out the hope of a more normal appearance for severely disfigured individuals.</p>
<p>So far, there have been seven face transplants worldwide – four in France, two in the United States and one in China. In the latter case, the patient died after he stopped taking anti-rejection drugs.</p>

<p>QUEBECOR WORLD DELAYS VOTE</p>
<p>MONTREAL -<span class="companylink">Quebecor World Inc</span>., now operating under protection from its creditors, is delaying the U. S. vote and Canadian meeting that will be held to approve the printer's restructuring plan.</p>
<p>The Canadian meeting will now be held on June 22 instead of June 18. U. S. creditors have until 5 p. m. eastern time on June 22 to submit their ballots.</p>
<p>The company still expects to present the plans for approval in Canada and the U. S. on June 30. It has said it hopes to emerge from creditor protection by mid-July.</p>
<p>URANIUM RUSH UNDERWAY</p>
<p>TORONTO -A global shift toward nuclear power is prompting countries to rush to lock in long-term access to tight supplies of uranium, and China and India look to be the next players to get in on the action.</p>
<p>A tie-up between <span class="companylink">Rosatom</span>, the Russian state-owned producer, and Canadian miner Uranium One announced this week is just the latest in a series of moves on the part of Asian and European countries to lock in uranium supply to fuel construction of dozens of new reactors over the next decade.</p>
<p>"I think, increasingly, the supply of reactors is being tied to security of supply of nuclear fuel," said Divya Reddy, an energy analyst with the Eurasia Group in Washington.</p>
<p>COTTAGE INDUSTRY STILL STRONG</p>
<p>OTTAWA -Ever dream of owning your own cottage? You're not alone, according to the 2009 Royal LePage Recreational Property report, a countrywide survey on ownership attitudes.</p>
<p>The real estate company's study found that many Canadians not only want to own a cottage or other recreational property, 64 per cent think it's a good long-term investment.</p>
<p>The survey found that to achieve their dream of owning a recreational property, 55 per cent of Canadians would be willing to make financial or lifestyle compromises: purchasing a property with family and friends, renting out the cottage, making it their primary residence, buying a fixer-upper, or moving into a smaller principal home.</p>
<p>BANKRUPTCY FOR PAPER FIRM</p>
<p>TORONTO -Specialty-paper company <span class="companylink">Fraser Papers Inc</span>., along with its subsidiaries, has filed for bankruptcy protection in an Ontario court amid continued operating losses, weak demand and lower selling prices for pulp and lumber.</p>
<p>Fraser also cited impending debt repayments and significant pension-funding obligations, and said it continues to pursue alternatives to restructure its operations.</p>
<p>The company said it will also seek protection from creditors in the U. S.</p>
<p>Fraser said weak pulp and lumber markets have drained its limited resources, more than offsetting the progress in its paper business.</p>
<p>SMELTER, REFINERY CLOSING</p>
<p>TORONTO -<span class="companylink">HudBay Minerals Inc</span>., which last February cancelled its $672-million acquisition of <span class="companylink">Lundin Mining Corp</span>. because of shareholder opposition, said Thursday it will close its copper smelter in Flin Flon, Man., by July 1 next year and its copper refinery at White Pine, Mich, soon afterwards. About 225 jobs will go at Flin Flon and 65 in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Flin Flon smelter has become uneconomic because of its age, market conditions and changing environmental rules, the company said.</p>
<p>The smelter's anode production is shipped by rail to White Pine for refining into cathodes. Copper concentrates produced at Flin Flon after next June will go elsewhere for smelting and refining, possibly offshore.</p>
<p>Hudbay will remain a fully-integrated zinc producer with up-to-date processing plants at Flin Flon and Brampton, Ont.</p>
<p>U. S. CONTRACT GOES TO ONTARIO</p>
<p>TORONTO -Shares of <span class="companylink">Magellan Aerospace</span> jumped more than 15 per cent on Thursday after the company was awarded a$60-million-US contract to build components for a new generation of U. S. fighter jets.</p>
<p>Stock in the Kitchener, Ont., company was up 27 cents at $2.02 on the Toronto Stock Exchange shortly after the market opened.</p>
<p>GM DROPS JET LEASES</p>
<p>NEW YORK -<span class="companylink">General Motors</span> has won approval to cancel leases for seven corporate jets and a hangar at a Detroit airport.</p>
<p>U. S. bankruptcy judge Robert Gerber approved the request at a hearing Thursday.</p>
<p>GM's former chief executive Rick Wagoner, who was pushed out in March, was criticized last year when he and other executives flew to Washington by corporate jet to ask for government aid to prop up the auto industry. GM has said it tried unsuccessfully to cancel some of the leases last year.</p>
<p>CRUISE OPERATOR BEATS TARGETS NEW YORK - Cruise-line operator <span class="companylink">Carnival Corp</span>. reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates after the company wooed vacationers with discounts and benefited from lower costs.Netincome dropped 32 per cent to $264 million US, or 33 cents a share, the company said. That topped the 29-cent average of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 13 per cent to $2.95 billion US in the three months ended May 31, compared with the $2.98-billion average estimate.</p>
<p>The company, which runs cruise lines including Seabourn, Princess and Cunard, is discounting tickets to boost demand and fill its ships.</p>
<p>Cancellations and cruises rearranged to avoid outbreaks of swine flu eroded some of the benefits of cost-cutting and lower fuel prices.</p>
<p>CHINA HURTS TIRE MAKERS</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -U.S. tire companies are being harmed by products from China, a U. S. agency ruled, setting up a decision by President Barack Obama on whether to impose tariffs or quotas on America's biggest source of imports.</p>
<p>The U. S. International Trade Commission ruled 4-2 that U. S. tiremakers are being hurt by $1.7 billion US in imports from China. The United Steelworkers union, which represents workers at tire factories, filed the case. U. S. tire companies including <span class="companylink">Goodyear Tire&Rubber Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Goodrich Corp</span>. haven't taken a position.</p>
<p>The ITC will next recommend what level of tariffs or quotas should apply to the Chinese imports, and Obama would have to make a decision on the so-called safeguard case by September.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The Who's Fabricated Pandemic; The World Health Organization is hoping the swine flu outbreak will offer it a chance to salvage its reputation</b>
</div><div>Michael Fumento   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>893 words</div><div>19 June 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>A global flu pandemic is a "when, not an if." So the World Health Organization (WHO) has been crying for five years. Now it can boast it was right. Problem is, the mildest pandemics of the 20th century killed at least a million people worldwide, and old-fashioned seasonal flu strikes every nation yearly, killing an estimated 250,000 to 500,000. But only 144 people had succumbed to H1N1 swine flu when the WHO declared its pandemic -- far less than seasonal flu's daily toll. Further, in Mexico, where the outbreak began and where it has been the most severe, cases had already peaked.</p>
<p>You see, the pandemic the WHO had been warning of was actually H5N1 avian flu. To get its pandemic, the organization used its own bizarre, unscientific new definition. Meanwhile, the declaration has signalled governments worldwide to launch emergency response plans. These will be costly when we can least afford it, could prompt severe restrictions on human activities (think China) and render the term "flu pandemic" essentially meaningless-- risking lethal public complacency if a bona fide one hits.</p>
<p>How could the WHO do this?</p>
<p>The organization's definition for "influenza pandemic" once required "several, simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness." But in 2005, it promulgated a new one that virtually ignores case numbers and completely ignores deaths. Now it requires "sustained chains of human-to-human transmission leading to community-wide outbreaks" in two parts of the world, with this addition: The cause must be an animal or human-animal flu virus; the latter known as a "genetic reassortment."</p>
<p>Thus, under the 2005 definition, "community-wide outbreaks" of swine flu in two South American countries and somewhere in China could qualify as a pandemic. No deaths required. Meanwhile, a pure human flu that killed 20 million people would not qualify.</p>
<p>The obvious presumption is that viruses with animal genes pose a greater threat. But that's "a matter of faith more than science," says James Chin, a University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist who was in charge of surveillance and control of communicable diseases at the WHO in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Indeed, the science indicates the presumption is false.</p>
<p>Since 1997, there have also been six confirmed human outbreaks from four different non-H5N1 avian flu strains, together causing merely 96 confirmed cases and one death.</p>
<p>Flu transmission from pigs to pig workers is apparently routine; yet a 2007 review of the MedLine Database found only 50 cases severe enough to make the medical literature.</p>
<p>The WHO first warned of an H5N1 avian flu pandemic in 2004, projecting up to 150 million deaths when it became readily transmissible among humans. Yet a 2007 study found that H5N1 -- though it's been rubbing shoulders with humanity at least since its 1959 detection in Scottish chickens -- was many mutations away from such a transmission ability.</p>
<p>We were also repeatedly warned that if H5N1 reassorted with human flu, the combination would pack together</p>
<p>the alleged severity of the bird virus and the infectiousness of the human one. Yet a 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found the opposite: that a genetically engineered reassortment given to ferrets -- the best animal models for human flu -- produced milder and less infectious flu than did pure H5N1. Reassortment didn't create a "super flu" but rather a 98-pound weakling.</p>
<p>As to human-pig hybrids, a 1976 New Jersey H1N1 swine flu outbreak in the dead of winter, when flu is most contagious, infected just 230 soldiers, killing one, on a crowded Army base.</p>
<p>The WHO knows its definition is faulty. The organization's Handbook for Journalists still states: "A pandemic virus can emerge" by adapting "during human infections." And the WHO has warned that one way avian flu could become pandemic is through a purely human mutation.</p>
<p>But it also knows its allegedly "inevitable" pandemic, despite its half-decade fear campaign, has virtually no chance of materializing. The swine flu outbreak gave the WHO a chance to salvage its reputation, by simply swapping the word "avian" for "swine."</p>
<p>In her pandemic announcement last Thursday, WHO director-general Margaret Chan smugly declared: "The world can now reap the benefits of investments over the last five years in pandemic preparedness." Wrong. Swine flu, being no more contagious and far milder than seasonal flu, calls for absolutely no actions that wouldn't apply to seasonal varieties. Further, a lot of that "investment" has been in vaccines specific to H5N1.</p>
<p>So the same people who grossly exaggerated the world AIDS and SARS outbreaks think they'll get away with it again. Let's hope governments and the media will finally call them to task when those millions of deaths don't occur.</p>
<p>For now, we'll pay in told and untold ways because the WHO has cried "havoc" and let slip the dogs of pandemic.</p>

</p>
<p>Treaty 6 chiefs in Saskatchewan and Alberta will sign an agreement this week to work together on a medicine chest task force.</p>
<p>The agreement comes after a traditional gathering of chiefs, elders and First Nations citizens to discuss the state of health care, with special reference to the medicine chest clause in the treaty.</p>
<p>The clause was inserted into Treaty 6, which covers the First Nations in central Alberta and Saskatchewan, because the chiefs present in 1876 feared the diseases that were being introduced as a result of increased European contact.</p>
<p>The clause stipulates that a "medicine chest be kept at the house of the Indian agent for the use and benefit of the Indians." Over the years, its meaning has been expanded and interpreted in the broader context of the spirit and intent of treaties to mean universal health care.</p>
<p>Medicare is a fact of life now for Canadians, but it isn't universal. There are still items such as the prescription drugs, dental and optical care that are not included.</p>
<p>Making health care truly universal for First Nations people has been the goal of our leaders for decades. Medical care for everyone has expanded greatly from the medical chest to modern medical care. If we are to regard our treaties as living documents, then we must see that they reflect the technology of the times. To do otherwise fossilizes our treaties and disregards their spirit and intent.</p>
<p>This gathering to discuss treaty issues is older than the treaties themselves. For generations our leaders and elders have gathered in the summer to discuss issues of importance across Indian Country. Information has been exchanged and policies developed at these meetings.</p>
<p>This year, the gathering takes place on the Moosomin First Nation and the topic under discussion is First Nations control of health care. This follows the discussions three decades ago that led to the policy of Indian control of Indian education.</p>
<p>Part of the discussions revolve around the threat of the H1N1 flu pandemic. This threat takes us back to the concerns expressed by our leaders more than 130 years ago. They feared the new diseases that were decimating their population and they wanted health care included under the terms of the treaty.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu, otherwise known as swine flu, has been in the news for several months. However, it's slipped to the back pages even though the pandemic is steadily growing throughout the world. The World Health Organization has declared the H1N1 flu the first pandemic of the 21st century and the first one in 41 years.</p>
<p>In Canada, it is hitting the First Nations and Inuit communities the hardest. In Manitoba, the First Nations communities of Garden River and St. Theresa's Point have been walloped by the flu outbreak. Across the border in Ontario, the Sandy Lake First Nation has reported more than 120 people sick with the flu.</p>
<p>So what are the factors that are leading to a high rate of H1N1 in the aboriginal community?</p>
<p>Inadequate living conditions that include poor housing and overcrowding are most probably the causes of its spread. It is impossible to prevent the disease from spreading when you have three families living in a two-bedroom home, according to Chief Adam Fiddler of the Sandy Lake First Nation.</p>
<p>On the Garden River First Nation, for example, only half the homes have running water.</p>
<p>As of June 12, there were 31 people in hospital on ventilators due to the H1N1 virus. Two-thirds of them were aboriginal. As of June 13, there were 96 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Nunavut.</p>
<p>The flu outbreak currently is restricted to areas of northeastern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario, but we can expect to see the disease spread even more across Indian country. During the summer our people travel widely to see family and attend social events.</p>
<p>The fear is that the virus will travel throughout Indian country and be in full bloom when the flu season hits later this fall and winter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have a jurisdictional issue, with the federal government holding the constitutional responsibility for "Indians and lands reserved for Indians" and the provinces holding the responsibility for health care. All too often our people fall through the cracks, with the two governments blaming one another for the failure to deliver proper services.</p>
<p>The flu pandemic of 1918 hit the First Nations hard. The fear is that this will be the case again. Many of our people live in Third World conditions far removed from the Canadian mainstream. Aboriginal communities are ground zero for the H1N1 flu pandemic and the federal and provincial governments must respond accordingly.</p>

</p>
<p>T he Calgary Vipers should be climbing on a plane today and heading to Tijuana for the start of a road trip in sunny Mexico.</p>
<p>Instead, they face three days of batting practice, likely in some rain, before hosting Victoria for their third straight three-game series against the Seals starting Tuesday.</p>
<p>Just as the Golden Baseball League season was about to begin, the Tijuana Potros, an expansion team, dropped out of the schedule due to the closure of several sports facilities in Mexico affected by the outbreak of the H1N1 flu. Without a place to play, the Potros begged off and left scheduling holes throughout the season.</p>
<p>The Vipers have five days off and after finishing back to back three game stints against the Seals, they'll play three more next week.</p>
<p>Vipers pitching/player coach Evan Greusel said he would've liked the chance to play another team before hosting Victoria again.</p>
<p>"To play anybody else would've been nice," said Greusel. "When you play a team that much, it almost becomes intersquad. You know the guys so well. They're almost like guys you play with every day because you're playing them every day. Usually in games like that, they're very even and they go either way.</p>
<p>"You like to face new teams and new guys and I'm sure they're looking forward to going home and facing somebody new. We could use the break right now."</p>
<p>The Vipers lost two of their three home games against the Seals this week, including a 6-5 loss during an afternoon game at Foothills Stadium Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Vipers had their chances.</p>
<p>In the second inning, leading hitter Fehlandt Lentini, who was batting a bloated .442 for the season, struck out with two runners on base and the game tied 1-1.</p>
<p>More egregious to the coaching staff was failing to score in the seventh inning with the bases loaded and none outs to build on a 3-2 lead.</p>
<p>Victoria tied it in the ninth and scored three runs in the 10th inning to win the game.</p>
<p>"That's the big thing. We had bases loaded, nobody out and we didn't score," complained batting coach Boots Day. "First guy(Clint Johnston) strikes out. It kills the thing right there. When you get bases loaded, you've got to score. The last three days, we've left guys on base way too much.</p>
<p>"We're getting lots of hits," he said. "It's the situational hitting that's killing us. They've got to bear down out there when guys are in scoring position."</p>
<p>Calgary's sluggers will get plenty of time to work out the kinks during batting practices scheduled for Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>"There's nothing you can fix. They've got to fix themselves. I can't hit for them," said Day.</p>
<p>Of course, even with the loss, the Vipers remain in first place in the North division with 15 wins and nine losses.</p>
<p>Last week, Lentini was named the league's player of the week with a five-game batting average of .545, with 12 hits in 22 at bats.</p>
<p>"Any time you're in first place, you're not going to complain," said Greusel. "Our biggest thing is these one-run games."</p>

</div><div>Anne Kyle </div>

</p>
<p>Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer said the climb in H1N1 positive cases in the last couple of days was likely due to people getting tested in response to media reports of an outbreak in the school system.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, Saskatchewan reported 381 positive tests for the virus -- the bulk of which were in Regina, Dr. Moira McKinnon said.</p>
<p>"Over the weekend we put out a notice on our website trying to encourage people not to get tested if they have mild symptoms of the disease,'' said McKinnon, explaining anyone with mild symptoms should stay home until they are symptom free. "We are seeing a lot of absenteeism in Regina. It is almost like the wave has moved from Saskatoon down to Regina. I think we have seen the peak of that and hopefully it will start to fade away in the next few days because there has been high absenteeism, and high absenteeism in hospitals.''</p>
<p>As of Wednesday the Public Health Agency of Canada surveillance numbers have indicated more than 4,900 people in Canada have tested positive for H1N1, with 12 deaths connected to it. There have been no reported deaths in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>In response to the situation in Manitoba where isolated northern communities have been hit hard by the virus, McKinnon said public health in Saskatchewan has stepped up testing in northern and border communities with Manitoba and in people who are hospitalized.</p>
<p>"We have got a smattering of cases, maybe three or four I think at this stage, of H1N1 in communities in the north and we are seeing some influenza-like illness but not a lot, and most of it has been quite mild,'' McKinnon said.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen anything serious yet, although we have had two hospitalizations (for H1N1). But again they are not serious enough to be transferred out.''</p>
<p>She also noted that one person -- a man in his 20s -- was hospitalized in a rural hospital in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region but his condition did not warrant that he be transferred into Regina.</p>
<p>"We will see more hospitalized patients over the next few months, but remember it is not unusual to see some hospitalizations during seasonal influenza season, particularly in people with asthma or long-standing respiratory illnesses," McKinnon said, adding 2,000 to 4,000 Canadians die from seasonal influenza every year.</p>

</div><div>By Arielle Godbout and Larry Kusch </div>
<div>762 words</div><div>18 June 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>A Manitoba woman who died of H1N1 complications was twice turned away by hospital staff who didn't diagnose the virus, said her brother.</p>
<p>Lorraine Wilson, 45, lived in the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, 730 kilometres north from Winnipeg, and worked at the local school library.</p>
<p>She complained of chest pains and laboured breathing two weeks ago, and went to a local hospital in The Pas on June 3, said her brother, Guy Constant.</p>
<p>They told her she had a cold and sent her home, but she returned two days later. She was then told to take Tylenol and sent home again, her brother said.</p>
<p>"They didn't check her, they didn't test her, they didn't do anything," Constant said as he choked up during a phone interview.</p>
<p>As her symptoms worsened, she returned to the hospital for a third time and was put on a ventilator.</p>
<p>"That time they told us the symptoms of the influenza," Constant said, adding her doctors began to run tests.</p>
<p>Officials from Nor-Man Regional Health Authority -- which includes The Pas -- could not be reached for comment Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Manitoba reported 34 new confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza on Wednesday, bringing the total to 260 -- nearly half of which are in Winnipeg. Two people in Manitoba with H1N1 have died -- Wilson, and a middle-aged Winnipeg man.</p>
<p>Wilson's illness was not confirmed to be H1N1 until she was transferred to Winnipeg on Sunday, June 7, by air ambulance. Constant said his sister remained in a near-catatonic state for a week and a half before she died Tuesday, June 16.</p>
<p>Constant, her husband, Archie, and 23-year-old daughter, April, were among family members who flew to Winnipeg to be with her.</p>
<p>Wilson was also diagnosed with pneumonia, which Constant said was a complication of her H1N1 infection, and her lungs began to fill up with liquid.</p>
<p>She had a final responsive moment a week before her death, said her brother.</p>
<p>"For a brief few minutes, she was able to respond," Constant said. "My sister nodded her head, she wiggled her toes." Wilson's condition continued to worsen as her kidneys began to fail, and the doctors informed the remaining family they may need to decide whether to remove her from life support.</p>
<p>His sister died Tuesday from a heart attack, before Wilson's family were forced to make the difficult decision.</p>
<p>"The Good Lord just made that decision for her," he said.</p>
<p>Wilson's family gathered Wednesday evening at her home to share stories.</p>
<p>"My sister was very friendly, outgoing. She was just always helping out," Constant said. "She would just reach out and help you any way she could. She had a very big heart."</p>
<p>Wilson was one of 21 confirmed H1N1 patients in the Nor-Man health region, an area that includes The Pas, Flin Flon and Snow Lake.</p>
<p>In a news release Wednesday, the province said "all Manitobans" are at risk of exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>"The influenza outbreak is provincewide and it is likely that H1N1 is present in every community in Manitoba," the government said.</p>
<p>It said although there has been an increase in the number of people with severe respiratory illness, they make up a small proportion of the people who have had the flu in Manitoba over the past two months.</p>
<p>The majority of people who have become ill have not required hospitalization, the government said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manitoba Public Insurance spokesman Brian Smiley said two employees working in one of MPI's Winnipeg facilities have confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>Smiley said the two have very mild cases of the virus, and other employees have been notified. Staff have also been encouraged to see a doctor if they're feeling unwell, and stay home from work.</p>
<p>The provincial Health Department Wednesday provided a breakdown, by regional health authority, of all confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Winnipeg has had 122 people test positive for the H1N1 flu virus over the past two months.</p>
<p>Another 80 cases have been confirmed in the Burntwood and Churchill regional health authorities, the government said.</p>
<p>Burntwood's territory covers 210,000 square miles north of the 53rd parallel, including the city of Thompson but excluding Flin Flon, The Pas, and Churchill. It also includes Garden Hill, St. Theresa Point and several other northern First Nations as well as the towns of Leaf Rapids, Lynn Lake and Gillam.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fraser Institute school rankings now a learning disability; Excessive emphasis put on them has begun to skew B.C. education</b>
</div><div>Jack Knox </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>775 words</div><div>18 June 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Early</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>Here's why the Fraser Institute school rankings suck: People take them seriously.</p>
<p>So seriously, in fact, that your kid's education is suffering in consequence. Teachers say schools are under so much pressure to perform well in the Fraser Institute ratings that they are abandoning curriculum in favour of getting good test results instead.</p>
<p>The annual high school rankings came out yesterday, the results as predictable as usual. The Saint Whoever private academies were perched at the top as if by birthright, while a bunch of schools named Former Mill Town Regional Secondary wallowed at the bottom, along with those inner city edifices where the custodian goes on syringe-and-condom patrol each morning.</p>
<p>Ten of the 13 Vancouver Island schools in the top 100 were private institutions; the other three -- Oak Bay, Claremont, Nanaimo's Dover Bay -- were in nice postal codes, the kind with more golden retrievers than pit bulls.</p>
<p>It's easy to argue that the Fraser Institute report says more about family demographics than teaching ability.</p>
<p>The rankings are also, as we should all know by now, based on narrow criteria. For the high school rankings, provincial exams are a big factor. For elementary schools, it's the Foundation Skills Assessment taken by all B.C. students in Grades 4 and 7 to test their knowledge of numeracy, reading and writing. The rankings don't account for less tangible factors, let alone performance in other subjects, in other grades.</p>
<p>Think of schools as restaurants, and the FSA tests as a hamburger. If a restaurant makes a good hamburger, it will do well in the Fraser Institute report. The soup might taste like dishwater, the chef might prove to be Ground Zero in the swine flu outbreak, the steak might come tougher than Surrey after dark and the servers might move as slowly as a glacier and be twice as frosty, but as long as that burger makes</p>
<p>diners drool like the front row at the peeler bar, the Fraser Institute will grant it five stars and the</p>
<p>customers will be lined</p>
<p>up out the door.</p>
<p>Fair enough, if all you want is a really good burger. But if the kitchen staff are so busy building the perfect burger that the other dishes fall flat as a Letterman joke at Sarah Palin's house, it's a lousy recipe.</p>
<p>And that, teachers say, is what's happening. The politicians lean on school district staff, who pressure the principals, who let teachers know that good test results are the priority.</p>
<p>Sometimes the directive is couched in principalspeak, but the message is obvious. "It's absolutely clear what they want you to do," one retired teacher said yesterday.</p>
<p>So the curriculum goes out the window and teachers end up spending inordinate amounts of time coaching kids how to pass a test.</p>
<p>It's not just the Fraser Institute stuff, says Thierry Ponchet, the president of the Greater Victoria Teachers' Association. Provincial exams have been modified in the past few years, and now include subjects such as Socials 11 and Science 10.</p>
<p>Sounds good from the perspective of parents who want a means of measuring their children's progress, but the reality, says Ponchet, is that schools just end up teaching to the tests.</p>
<p>Rote memorization of dates and numbers without context replaces real learning. In Science 10, that means there's no room for the cool lab experiments that keep kids engaged. In Socials 11, no time to capitalize on students' interest in Obamamania. "It becomes a disservice to education," Ponchet says.</p>
<p>I have long defended the Fraser Institute against the protestations of the B.C. Teachers' Federation, whose blanket condemnation of the report has smacked of self-interest, the Wizard of Oz anxious that no one get a glimpse behind the curtain. Parents frustrated by the difficulty in gauging the quality of their children's education have been able to seize on the rankings to peek inside the classroom, to use the ratings as a yardstick where no other measuring device exists.</p>
<p>Two things happen as soon as the report comes out each year: Parents 1) dismiss it out of hand, then 2) rush to read the results. Put in perspective, the Fraser Institute ratings are fine.</p>
<p>But when the emphasis on the report is so great that gun-shy schools and paranoid parents allow it to get in the way of kids getting a proper education, we all have a problem.</p>

</p>
<p>During a meeting between the federal health minister and First Nations leaders Wednesday, the federal government turned down a request to set up a field hospital in a northern Manitoba First Nations region hit hard by swine flu, according to one of the chiefs who attended.</p>
<p>Garden Hill First Nations Chief David Harper said a senior Health Canada official told the chiefs that setting up a field hospital would actually slow down efforts to stem the outbreak of the H1N1 virus in their communities. Harper said he responded by saying that it takes around 20 hours for someone from the aboriginal communities-- which sit about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg--to be flown to hospital in Winnipeg for treatment.</p>
<p>Harper, along with chiefs from St. Theresa Point First Nation and Wasagamack First Nation, met with Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq for 30 minutes and Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl for close to an hour. Harper said the meetings were positive and he came away with a renewed belief that the federal government is concerned about the situation in their communities.</p>
<p>"(Aglukkaq) heard us, she knows why we were there and we told her that there is a problem at hand, we need to start moving forward on this and not stalling," said Harper.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq's office said, "the minister had a productive meeting with the chiefs. The meeting went well."</p>
<p>Churchill NDPMP Niki Ashton said the ministers should have agreed to the field hospital.</p>
<p>"I'm very concerned that the field hospital was rejected--these communities need strengthened medical services," said Ashton in a media statement.</p>
<p>Harper, along with St. Theresa Point Chief David McDougall and Wasagamack Chief Jerry Knott, had travelled to Ottawa to implore federal officials to take action in their region, which is being buffeted by an H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Manitoba's health authority said earlier in the week that there are 78 cases of swine flu in the small communities.</p>
<p>The chiefs said they face shortages of medical personnel and supplies to deal with the flu outbreak, including a lack of hand sanitizers in communities where many houses are overcrowded and lack running water.</p>
<p>Less than half of the homes in each of the First Nations communities have running water.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First flu, now teen's death in holding cell -</b>
</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch </div>
<div>648 words</div><div>18 June 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>ONE of the remote First Nation reserves grappling with the H1N1 flu outbreak is also coping with the suicide of a teenager who died while in police custody.</p>
<p>Calvin Waylon McDougall, 19, was found dead May 7 in a cell at the Garden Hill police station. The death was never made public.</p>
<p>His family says McDougall used a strip of blanket tied to a doorknob in the holding cell to hang himself.</p>
<p>Now questions are being asked why McDougall wasn't being properly monitored in his cell.</p>
<p>"He was a nice guy -- quiet, kind, loving," said McDougall's grandfather, Absalom McKay. But McDougall, who worked occasionally as a plumber's assistant on the reserve, was struggling with the death of his longtime girlfriend, who killed herself on New Year's Day 2008. He also occasionally partied with friends who drank "superjuice," a potent, yeast-based homebrew that can produce black-outs.</p>
<p>"When they take that stuff, they don't know what they're doing," said McKay. "We were trying to take care of him. We truly believed he was getting through."</p>
<p>McDougall was planning to marry his new girlfriend from the nearby reserve of St. Theresa Point this summer. The couple was expecting a child. Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point, two of the province's poorest and most troubled communities, are in the midst of an outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus that has infected hundreds of band members and forced at least 149 people to be airlifted to Winnipeg by air ambulance.</p>
<p>The bands are begging for a field hospital, more supplies and a long-term solution to overcrowding and a lack of sewer and water service to many homes.</p>
<p>A similar epidemic involving youth suicides has prompted aboriginal leaders to call repeatedly for more counselling and funding for youth programs.</p>
<p>Last month, officials from Pukatawagan wrote to Ottawa begging for help with a rash of suicides plaguing the reserve south of Lynn Lake. Youth workers surveyed 10 other northern communities and found that more than two dozen children and teens had committed suicide in the last year, even though Ottawa and the province had pledged to help with suicides. McKay said he knows there's been money earmarked for counselling services but they never seem to be available when band members need them.</p>
<p>"We lost my granddaughter to suicide three years ago. We never got counselling for that. When Waylon lost his girlfriend, there was no counselling," said McKay. "I get frustrated. We need some help."</p>
<p>McDougall's death also raises questions about how well band constables monitor suspects in the holding cells. McKay said he is trying not to ask those questions, but he said other family members wonder why no one checked on McDougall overnight to ensure he was all right.</p>
<p>McKay said the RCMP donated video monitoring equipment for the cells several years ago but the gear isn't working properly or doesn't work in all cells. Garden Hill has its own police department with about six constables who keep the peace and run the police station and small jail.</p>
<p>Const. Sam Monias, who runs the police department, referred questions about McDougall's death to the band office. Chief David Harper was in Ottawa Wednesday and couldn't be reached. A band councillor familiar with the issue could also not be reached.</p>
<p>RCMP spokeswoman Sgt. Line Karpish said McDougall was taken into custody in the wee hours of May 7 following a disturbance at a home on the reserve. RCMP were called in to investigate after McDougall was found dead, and Karpish said the investigation is almost done. Once it's finished, it will be forwarded to the chief medical examiner, who automatically triggers an inquest whenever someone dies in police custody.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ciesielski gets down to business</b>
</div><div>Mark Bryson   </div>
<div>RECORD STAFF</div>
<div>780 words</div><div>18 June 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE</p>
<p>Victor Ciesielski has learned a number of valuable lessons since earning a full-time job on the Canadian Professional Golf Tour last fall.</p>
<p>At the top of that list would be to never again act as his own swing coach. Ciesielski is able to look back and laugh now as he recalls how he spent five long months working by himself while spending the bulk of this past winter in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he returned home in the spring and did a few taped sessions with coach Dave Smallwood at Whistle Bear that he finally got to see what he'd accomplished. The video didn't lie.</p>
<p>"When I saw the swing, the one I worked so hard on, I was embarrassed for everyone I had played golf with," laughed the good-natured Ciesielski, who is making a quick pit stop at home this week to visit friends and family.</p>
<p>"It was just awful. I worked so hard on what I thought was right and it was the total opposite of what I should have been doing."</p>
<p>Fortunately for Ciesielski, 24, the swing is in great shape now and he is eager to start earning significant paycheques when he returns to action next week at the Canadian Tour's $150,000 ATB Financial Classic in Calgary.</p>
<p>The six-foot-four Ciesielski has had mixed results to date on the Canadian Tour, earning $1,609 with a 19th-place finish at the Costa Rica Classic in December and $300 for finishing 75th at the City of Surrey Invitational earlier this month. There were a pair of missed cuts in between.</p>
<p>Just how difficult it is to actually make a living as a golfer is another lesson that Ciesielski has quickly learned. He figures it costs about $2,500 a week to compete on the Canadian Tour when all his expenses are taken into consideration, meaning he needs an eighth- or ninth-place finish to just break even.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the former Canadian amateur team member, he has Whistle Bear co-owners Emilio Cabral and Carlos DaSilva in his corner. The two are footing the majority of the bills for the Canadian Tour rookie so he can focus on results instead of expenses.</p>
<p>In addition to the four Canadian Tour events he has played this season, Ciesielski also received an exemption to play in the Hawaiian Open earlier this year and played with former PGA Tour player David Ishii and budding superstar Tadd Fujikawa in his final round.</p>
<p>He was also in Mexico to compete in Canadian Tour events when the H1N1 flu outbreak dominated front page headlines across the world. The tour managed to complete its event in Mazatlan before pulling the plug on a tournament scheduled for San Luis Potosi the following week.</p>
<p>"It was my first time in Mexico and I was worried about eating the food the first week and then the second week I didn't even think about food because I was wearing a mask for three days," recalled Ciesielski, who won three Great Lakes Tour events in 2008.</p>
<p>"We flew into Mexico City wearing the masks and were checked out by doctors before we could leave."</p>
<p>Ciesielski faces a gruelling schedule starting Monday in Calgary for a pro-am event. After next week's tournament, he'll make stops in Edmonton, Saskatoon and Winnipeg before heading back to Ontario for the Monday qualifier for next month's Canadian Open at Glen Abbey.</p>
<p>If he plays the weekend in Winnipeg, it will mean that he'd have less than 24 hours to prepare for the Monday event at Heron Point in Alberton, Ont.</p>
<p>Ciesielski, of course, competed in two Canadian Opens as an amateur, recording a memorable hole-in-one in 2006 at the Hamilton Golf and Country Club.</p>
<p>A full-time gig on the PGA Tour is Ciesielski's long-term goal, but this summer he simply wants to earn enough money to secure his Canadian Tour card for 2010 and perhaps even attempt to qualify for a Nationwide event or two along the way.</p>
<p>At season's end, he'll throw his hat into the ring and make his first attempt at the PGA Tour's qualifying school. "I'm working as hard as I can to get off the Canadian Tour because that's the goal for everyone. The long-term goal is to make the (PGA) Tour and make a living and continue playing golf as long as I can."</p>

<p>The families of 15 passengers who died in the March 12 crash of a Sikorsky helicopter off Newfoundland and the sole survivor of the tragedy are suing the U.S. company, alleging it made false claims about how long pilots could safely fly if oil leaked out of the chopper's gearbox.</p>

<p>The man, who was visiting friends, was admitted to hospital June 9, said Dr. Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph area.</p>
<p>"The influenza virus contributed to his death. Whether ... in a minor or a major way, I don't have the medical evidence to say," she said.</p>

</div><div>Jeanette Stewart   </div>

</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region could have a vaccination plan for the H1N1 virus as soon as this fall, CEO Moira Davies told reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We're quite hopeful there will be a vaccine developed and available," she said following her annual speech to the Greater Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>According to the provincial government's latest update, as of Wednesday there were 381 confirmed cases of H1N1 in the province. As of Monday, there were 112 cases detected in the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>"People can die from it," Davies said. "We need to control it and certainly immunization would be a part of that."</p>
<p>Davies chose to comment on the "health of the state," rather than the "state of the health region" in her address to the chamber. Part of this discussion included findings of a report released by chief medical officer Dr. Cory Neudorf in 2008.</p>
<p>HIV rates have risen "dramatically," from 5.6 cases per 100,000 people in 2004 to 25.8 in 2008, or more than 400 per cent in four years.</p>
<p>This is "mainly attributed to injection drug use, especially among our aboriginal community," Davies said in her speech Wednesday at the Travelodge Hotel. One-quarter of health region residents over 12 years of age reported binge drinking and the 2007 smoking rate was "significantly higher" than the national average. Core residents reported "dismal results" in the health survey, she said.</p>
<p>Changing demographics represent two serious challenges for the health region. Both the number of senior citizens and the number of aboriginals will be up in the province, Davies said. Projections show the region's senior population, aged 65 to 74, will increase 105 per cent in the next 19 years.</p>
<p>The health region also anticipates the results of the province's Patient First review this fall.</p>
<p>The "business sector is very prepared" to help the health region deal with the results of the review, said Troy Davies, an executive member of the chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>"There will be some issues out of that. From the business sector we want to say that we're there to help," he said.</p>
<p>Davies also told chamber members about a number of moves made to improve care in the health region. These included Internet service in some rooms, the recruitment of more than 100 Filipino nurses, progress on a new children's hospital in the city and a new health bus serving the core community.</p>

</div><div>By Mia Rabson </div>

<p>OTTAWA -- Three chiefs from the Island Lake region flew to Ottawa Tuesday to plead with the federal government for more supplies and even a temporary field hospital to address the growing outbreak of influenza in their communities.</p>
<p>Garden Hill Chief David Harper said the federal government's response to the pandemic on reserves in Manitoba is "unacceptable."</p>
<p>He said there is an urgent need for a field hospital to address the number of patients with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>"Why isn't Canada bringing a hospital in instead of sending people out?" asked Harper at a news conference with NDP MP Niki Ashton on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>Ashton, who represents Churchill, the riding that includes the Island Lake reserves, said Tuesday she is embarrassed as a Canadian to see the conditions the people in Island Lake are living in.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of May, 149 people have been flown to Winnipeg by air ambulance from Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point. Several have ended up on respirators in intensive care, including two women in their 20s from St. Theresa Point who were otherwise healthy until they came down with the flu.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people in both reserves are suffering from flu symptoms. Eighteen cases of H1N1 have been confirmed in St. Theresa Point, five in Garden Hill and two in Wasagamack.</p>
<p>The chiefs were hoping for a meeting with Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, but her spokeswoman, Josee Bellemare, said the minister could not accommodate the chiefs on such short notice.</p>
<p>During question period Tuesday, Aglukkaq said the medical supplies in the communities are "adequate."</p>
<p>Bellemare said the nursing stations have been stocked with antiviral medication, gloves, masks, gowns and hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>"Stocks of these supplies are replenished as quickly as needed," said Bellemare.</p>
<p>But the chiefs said the supplies are only being used at the nursing stations and aren't available to the community at large. With more than half the homes in St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill lacking running water, hand sanitizer is a much-needed alternative to warm water and soap, they said.</p>
<p>Harper said he spent $15,000 that had been intended for the school graduation on face masks and hand sanitizer. The chiefs are also looking for long-term investments in housing so the reserves are better equipped to face any future health threats.</p>
<p>The overcrowding and poor state of housing on many remote reserves contributes to generally poor health among residents and makes them more susceptible to serious cases of influenza, said the chiefs.</p>
<p>The chiefs and Ashton noted Canada spent $425 million to help rebuild foreign countries after the tsunami in 2004 but is ignoring the pleas from reserves for improved housing and infrastructure.</p>
<p>"What we do across the world we should do in our own backyard," said Ashton.</p>

<p>Re: "Alberta vaccination effort could cost millions," June 12.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical health officer, says plans are underway to vaccinate the most vulnerable Albertans in October. He lists people who smoke, are obese or are in poor health. There is no mention of vulnerable aboriginal communities similar to St. Theresa Point First Nation in Manitoba, where seriously ill swine flu victims are being flown out whenever a plane is available. If the Alberta government continues to ignore the abject poverty on our reserves, this population will be hardest hit in a pandemic. Why not work to improve their health while we await a vaccine?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Airline pension payouts trimmed; Deals with unions buy time for Air Canada, but the carrier will have to raise $600 million</b>
</div><div>Chris Sorensen </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>674 words</div><div>17 June 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>B01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>Air Canada has bought itself some breathing room after hammering out tentative agreements on pension funding with its employees, but observers say it still may not be enough to keep the country's largest airline out of bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>The airline reached tentative deals with its five biggest unions this week that include a moratorium on pension payments for 21 months, with four of the five unions also agreeing to wage freezes over the same period.</p>
<p>As well, the agreements call for Air Canada to raise $600 million in financing.</p>
<p>That includes $200 million to $300 million in the form of a federal government loan from Export Development Canada and up to $200 million from parent, ACE Aviation Holdings Inc., according a source familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>The loans are needed to keep the airline from being dragged into its second filling under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in less than six years.</p>
<p>Karl Moore, a business professor at McGill University, said the goal appears to be finding a way to "skinny" through a few more months in the hope that the global economy recovers and the demand for air travel returns.</p>
<p>"Is there still a risk of CCAA? Absolutely," he said. "But the risk has gone down significantly over the past week."</p>
<p>Air Canada announced early yesterday that it reached agreements with the Air Canada Pilots Association and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents 6,700 flight attendants. It also reached agreements with three other unions last week. The deals, if ratified, include a provision that would give employees a 15 per cent stake in the airline and a seat on its board.</p>
<p>All of the unions, with the exception of CUPE, have agreed to freeze wages and pension benefits for 21 months.</p>
<p>But David Newman, an analyst at National Bank Financial, warned investors yesterday the airline still must address other notable financial obligations this year - including $617 million in debt repayments - plus the challenge of funding its day-to-day operations when ticket sales continue to plummet due to the weak economy.</p>
<p>"The fundamentals continue to deteriorate, given the recession, the onset of the H1N1 influenza virus, a competitive marketplace and rising fuel costs," said Newman, who still rates Air Canada's shares "underperform," with a 12-month price target of $1.</p>
<p>Shares of Air Canada closed yesterday at $1.62, up 13 cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Newman said the current quarter looks particularly challenging with "continued economic weakness and pricings pressures." He said his calculations show that Air Canada is on track to burn through one half of its roughly $1 billion in available cash in the third and fourth quarters.</p>
<p>In other words, the bulk of the $600 million in financing that Air Canada is now looking to raise may be necessary just to keep it from running afoul of its covenants, including a recently renegotiated agreement with a credit card processor.</p>
<p>Calin Rovinescu, chief executive of Air Canada, in a statement said the next step is to obtain the necessary federal government approvals for the new pension funding arrangements, which call for fixed payments of $150 million, $175 million, and $225 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively, while raising money.</p>
<p>"Discussions are ongoing with several potential lenders who are assessing our financing needs."</p>
<p>What the agreements do not address is Air Canada's overall costs, estimated to be at least 30 per cent higher than its main domestic rival WestJet Airlines Ltd.</p>
<p>A source familiar with the negotiations said Air Canada has committed to finding "hundreds of millions" in annual cost savings expected to come mainly from streamlining its processes and procedures.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 claims two Manitobans - Winnipeg man, woman from north first deaths here</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch   </div>

</p>
<p>A Winnipeg man and a woman from northern Manitoba, both in their 40s, are the first two provincial residents to die of the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, chief provincial public health officer, said on Tuesday the Winnipeg man "had no known significant underlying health condition" that would have put him more at risk. But the woman from the vast Nor-Man health region -- which includes more than a dozen northern communities including The Pas, Flin Flon, Pukatawagan and Grand Rapids -- "did have significant underlying health conditions," he said. He gave few details about the individuals on Tuesday -- even refusing to confirm when each of them died.</p>
<p>Both had been hospitalized.</p>
<p>The two Manitoba deaths, together with two reported Tuesday in Quebec, brought to 11 the number of Canadians who have died from the H1N1 flu virus. In Quebec, health officials said a man and a woman from Montreal -- both between 30 and 50 years old -- had underlying medical conditions when they died that made them susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>Kettner told reporters while he was sorry to bear the bad news, the deaths were "not surprising" given the number of people who are severely ill and the fact that an estimated 100 people die in Manitoba each year due to influenza.</p>
<p>"It's particularly concerning, of course, when they occur in people in their 40s, because this is a premature death by anyone's test," he said.</p>
<p>Kettner wouldn't say whether either victim was aboriginal, adding such information would not be released on a case-by-case basis. Earlier, the province had said two-thirds of those seriously ill with the flu were Inuit or First Nations persons. The provincial health department also announced 74 new confirmed cases of H1N1 flu on Tuesday, bringing the Manitoba total to 226. However, the number of people severely ill with the virus appears to be fairly stable. Dr. Brian Postl, president and CEO of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said there were 31 patients on ventilators in intensive care units in city hospitals -- about the same number as on Monday.</p>
<p>Kettner said while the province has now seen its first deaths attributed to H1N1, it's important that this be put into perspective. The vast majority of confirmed Manitoba cases are still relatively mild and have not required hospitalization, he said. "And the majority of patients hospitalized have either done well or are holding their own," he said, even though a number of them are critically ill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health authorities are continuing to urge doctors and nurses to travel to northern communities to ease the burden the H1N1 threat has placed on health providers there.</p>
<p>Two additional nurse practitioners are now working in one northern community, and three more doctors will travel north this week. The province didn't specify where they were going.</p>
<p>As well, two more nurse practitioners, 13 nurses and 10 University of Manitoba medical residents have volunteered to travel to northern communities and "are about to be scheduled," Postl said.</p>
<p>Jim Wolf, federal regional director of First Nation and Inuit health, said Ottawa was working with regional health authorities to assign doctors and nurses as necessary to communities that need their services most.</p>
<p>He also said hand sanitizers would be delivered to St. Theresa Point late Tuesday or early Wednesday, with other northern communities receiving shipments shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Police are investigating allegations of extortion and Mafia-meddling in a $10.6 million contract to fix the roof at Montreal city hall.</p>
<p>The allegations were made public in yesterday's edition of La Presse.

<p>Alberta health officials have determined that a carpenter who travelled to Mexico before working at a central Alberta hog farm did not spread the H1N1 flu virus to the pigs.</p>
<p>"We ruled him out," said Howard May, spokesman with Alberta Health and Wellness. May said authorities may never know how the pigs on the farm near Rocky Mountain House got sick.</p>
<p>The entire 2,200-pig herd was eventually destroyed after farmer Arnold Van Ginkel told his veterinarian his pigs were coughing and showing other signs of sickness.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency quarantined the farm and took blood tests. Scientists originally thought the carpenter may have spread the illness to the animals when he worked in Van Ginkel's barn April 14.</p>

<p>Swine flu has forced one member of a New York improv group coming to Edmonton for Improvaganza to pull out of the festival. Peter Mcnierney of 4Track, a New York improv group showcasing Sunday at Improvaganza, was diagnosed with swine flu on Sunday, and is recuperating in hospital. 4Track has found a replacement, Russ Armstrong, so the show will go on. Improvaganza, the 10th annual edition of Edmonton's comedy festival, runs at the Varscona Theatre and B-Scene Studio Wednesday through June 27.</p>

<p>An isolated First Nation in northwestern Ontario is bracing for more confirmed cases of swine flu after an H1N1 outbreak was confirmed over the weekend.</p>
<p>"Ten confirmed cases and they're not swabbing anymore to confirm; they're just treating everybody as if they have it," Chief Adam Fiddler said Monday. "It is an outbreak, and the people that come forward, they're being told, 'You have it and you're going to be treated.' "</p>
<p>A bout of the virus was confirmed in the community of Sandy Lake First Nation when more than 120 people, including 43 children, were treated with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"(Testing) is a lengthy process. It will take several days and, because it's most likely (H1N1), they can't wait until they get the test results back," said Fiddler. He said residents have been urged to stay home and to avoid congregating in large groups to prevent further spread of the virus in the community, about 500 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Fiddler said the local store, the only place in the community that sells food, was struggling to stay open after more than half its staff came down with flu-like symptoms last week.</p>

<p>Relatives of a swine flu patient who died at a British hospital spoke of their devastation Monday as authorities appealed for calm over the first death from the pandemic beyond the Americas. Jacqui Fleming, 38, from the Scottish city of Glasgow, died in hospital on Sunday, two weeks after giving birth prematurely to her second child. Her family was dealt a new blow as health officials announced the baby boy named Jack, born June 1, had died of complications not related to the virus. Fleming's family earlier said in a statement they were "absolutely devastated" by her death. Government officials urged people to remain calm, as Scotland's health minister Nicola Sturgeon emphasized that most H1N1 flu cases were relatively mild and that the "risk to the general public remains low.</p>

</p>
<p>Dr. John Sehmer came home from a three-week holiday in New Zealand to find he owed $1,400 on his iPhone bill. And that wasn't even for phone calls -- except perhaps the one when Rogers called to see if he was happy with the service.</p>
<p>It was wireless data roaming charges that picked Sehmer's pocket.</p>
<p>With anywhere, anytime Internet connections the order of the new technological age, Sehmer isn't alone in finding out wireless surfing can come at a staggering cost.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, David Morton was sold on a Rogers Rocket Mobile Internet Stick -- a wireless USB modem that links to the Rogers network and provides wireless data connectivity when you're away from a wired-in or Wi-fi Internet connection.</p>
<p>It's a useful solution for road warriors and other mobile Internet users, but starting at $25 for 500 megabytes of data -- compared to upwards of 60 gigabytes or more on cable or ADSL Internet connections starting at about the same price -- it doesn't add up to an economical deal.</p>
<p>For many users, a combination of the two -- a wired-in Internet solution for home and a USB modem for when they're on the road -- is the best answer.</p>
<p>But some consumers are reading the fine print too late to avoid hefty contract cancellation penalties.</p>
<p>"I went into the Rogers store in Yaletown (a Vancouver neighbourhood) and had quite a discussion with them," Morton said. "It was kind of sold to us as a home Internet solution. They didn't tell us it had limits."</p>
<p>By the time he realized that wasn't the right solution, it was too late.</p>
<p>"My wife used it for just over the one-month trial period and when she took it back they stuck us for the penalty," said Morton.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that talk of megabytes and gigabytes is so much techno-gobbledygook for many consumers. They may have no idea what it translates into when it comes to websurfing, sharing videos, e-mail, downloading movies and music, or the many other functions that have made computers an indispensable tool of daily living.</p>
<p>Nadir Mohamed, the new chief executive at Rogers Communications, said in a recent interview that his company is prepared to address both the needs of early adopters who are heavy data users and of consumers who may be afraid to try new smartphones because they are worried about high bills.</p>
<p>His words were backed up by Rogers Wireless's recent announcement of promotional pricing of $30 a month for six gigabytes of data with its new <span class="companylink">Google</span> Android phones. It's the same deal the company offered when it brought Apple's iPhone to Canada last year. However, that pricing is only available for customers who buy one of the two</p>
<p>Android-powered phones, the HTC Dream or the HTC Magic. And the offer ends July 1.</p>
<p>Mohamed also said his company is looking at possible changes in data roaming charges.</p>
<p>Gordon Nelson, Rogers vice-president and general manager for B.C., said it is not the company's intent to sell consumers an Internet solution that's not right for their needs. He said the company will consider waiving the contract penalty for customers who mistakenly signed up for the Rogers Rocket mobile service thinking they were getting the equivalent of a no-limits plan.</p>
<p>For most Internet users, home-wired Internet such as cable and ADSL amounts to the equivalent of no limits, since most are well within their plan's cap.</p>
<p>"I would say we would like those individuals to get in touch with Rogers and we will review each individual case," Nelson said of customers like Morton. "It would be our intent to make sure we have customer satisfaction."</p>
<p>Nelson pointed out billing safeguards in his company's plans such as text message warnings when a limit is close to being reached, and optional plans that cap bills at $100 during a billing period. According to Rogers, the average usage for the Rocket among its customers is under 500 MB, within the lowest-priced $25 mobile data plan.</p>
<p>But users considering this for their main home connection should remember 500 MB usually suits just one person using the connection, and often for mobile use only. That limit would fall far short of the needs of a family sharing a home Internet connection.</p>
<p>To give you some idea of Internet usage, from mobile and from wired home Internet connections, here is a tally from some of the people on my Twitter network:</p>
<p>- Tris Hussey, a tech blogger, photographer and social media specialist, tested his Telus mobility wireless USB modem, and in 35 minutes ran up 70 MB of data usage. He wasn't downloading movies or doing any other particularly data-heavy tasks: it was web-surfing, receiving e-mail, and instant messaging with Tweetdeck, a Twitter application, open.</p>
<p>- Anthony Floyd, a father of two, said his home use with a cable Internet connection averages 17 GB per month, with a low over the past 11 months of 6.1 GB and a high of 55 GB.</p>
<p>- Jon Jennings listens to five GB of podcasts auto-downloaded through iTunes every month. Jennings points out downloading a five-minute video amounted to 25 MB.</p>
<p>- Greg Andrews and his two roommates have to watch that they don't blow their monthly cap of 200 GB up/200 GB down through Vancouver's Novus network. For mobile wireless, Andrews estimates one gigabyte might be good for basic e-mail and web-type use, but add music or video onto that and it's easy to hit.</p>
<p>In Sehmer's case, it wasn't a wireless USB modem that led to bills amounting to more than $100 a day at times, but data roaming charges on his iPhone. Wary of roaming charges when he travelled, Sehmer took an unlocked phone to New Zealand and used a local network SIM card there for voice calls.</p>
<p>What he failed to realize was that e-mail landing in his iPhone's in-box was costing hundreds of dollars. He wasn't web-surfing, and estimates he may have used the GPS mapping service on his phone two or three times.</p>
<p>"I had huge wireless data roaming charges," he said. "I wouldn't mind if I had a clue it was going to be like that.</p>
<p>"I did try to find out what the rates were before leaving. Through Rogers' website, I couldn't get any understanding of what the rates would be. There was something about so much per kilobyte downloaded, but one really has no idea what kilobytes are used to check an e-mail."</p>
<p>Sehmer disputed the bill with Rogers, but it was only after the company cut off his service that it relented and agreed to waive all the extra charges from the trip.</p>
<p>"Ironically, they cut me off during the (early) swine flu pandemic, and I'm a doctor," said Sehmer. "They told me I'd have to give a credit card number to get it hooked up again and pay a re-hookup fee."</p>
<p>Roaming charges can add up to astronomical bills. If you have a wireless data plan on your iPhone, BlackBerry or other smartphone, consider turning off the data functionality when you leave the country. Some people have their smartphones set to automatically retrieve data such as e-mail, a costly task if they forget that it's on when they leave home.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>How Much Wireless Do You Need?</p>
<p>According to companies such as Telus and Rogers, average USB wireless modem customers go through less than 500 MB per month, but heavy users can easily exceed that amount. Both Telus and Rogers offer mobile Internet sticks starting at 500 MB for $25. Here's what the companies say is normal usage:</p>
<p>- One e-mail, text with no attachments: 4 KB*</p>
<p>- E-mail with small attachment (PowerPoint, Excel sheet): 40 KB</p>
<p>- E-mail with one photo attached: 1 MB (although larger photo formats could be much more)</p>
<p>- Web browsing: 100 KB for average page such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or <span class="companylink">eBay</span></p>
<p>- MP3 download: 4 MB for three-minute song</p>
<p>- Online gaming: 270 KB per minute</p>
<p>- Streaming audio: 1 MB per minute</p>
<p>- Streaming video: 2 MB per minute</p>
<p>* 1,000 KB = 1 MB; 1,000 MB = 1 GB</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Federal politicians play chicken more cautiously than Hollywood's testosterone addled hot-rodders. So in putting the country on a collision course with a summer election, Michael Ignatieff is wearing a seatbelt and crash helmet.</p>
<p>If an accident occurs this week, if Ignatieff provokes the election he almost convincingly says he doesn't want, Liberals figure the Conservatives will be hauled away on stretchers.</p>
<p>Better still, if the fourth campaign in five years is to be prevented, someone other than the Liberal leader will have to blink. At the moment of impact, or in that bat of an eye, Ignatieff at best becomes prime minister and at worst exorcises the Stéphane Dion demon.</p>
<p>Both are leaps forward for a party caught too often savaging policies before meekly letting them pass. Ending those contradictions was essential and is made possible now by a change in prevailing winds.</p>
<p>The Liberals are enjoying a reassuring bump in opinion polls even as the recession drags down the Conservatives. Those trends, along with Stephen Harper's slide from leadership asset to liability, suggest this is a promising, if not yet quite prime time for Ignatieff to give voters a chance to do what they do most often when the economy tanks: Rewarding the alternative by default while punishing the party in power.</p>
<p>It's that dynamic, not oh-so-modest Liberal demands for Employment Insurance reform and added stimulus accountability, that will decide this test of wills. Compromise may still emerge if the Conservatives balk at facing angry voters, or if the NDP decides it will bear the brunt of any collateral damage.</p>
<p>Either way, the Liberals improve their position. An election now might reasonably secure them a minority government. An election postponed exposes rival's weaknesses.</p>
<p>Win-win is good politics, particularly when there's an added bonus. Committing to an election if necessary but not necessarily to an election allows Ignatieff to sound tough but fair, determined but pragmatic. It draws Dion's missing line in the sand while recognizing that an election so soon after the last will be welcome as swine flu.</p>
<p>Even the Liberals, if they were candid, would admit there are reasons to be otherwise occupied for the next few weeks. Bluster, cynicism and opportunism aside, they aren't ready for an election, nor is their leader.</p>
<p>Attack ads find credibility in a kernel of truth. Ignatieff needs to become more comfortable in his prodigal skin to debunk the ubiquitous Conservative spots accusing him of "just visiting.''</p>
<p>As much as he has to offer, including useful international experience and close connections to Barack Obama's confidantes, Ignatieff is still climbing an exhausting learning curve about a country he left for the grander rewards of greater challenges.</p>
<p>Conservatives will certainly frame Ignatieff as a patrician, self-absorbed outsider in a campaign Harper began road testing yesterday. Again and again Ignatieff will be blamed for slowing the stimulus flow to ordinary Canadians for the sole purpose of advancing his personal ambition to be prime minister.</p>
<p>That and the inevitable gaffes of an inexperienced leader coming to politics late in life are predictable. But Liberals also know those horrors can't be avoided by delaying an election that's no more than months away. Conservatives will use that time, their deep pockets and the anything-goes pre-election funding rules to more deeply etch their Ignatieff image.</p>
<p>With that wreck folding in slow motion, Liberals checked the rear-view mirror and, for the first time since losing power, put the pedal to the metal.</p>

<p>NETANYAHU'S PEACE PLAN HAILED</p>
<p>BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday evening that he had taken an "important first step" towards Middle East peace, officials said in Berlin.</p>
<p>"The chancellor had a long telephone conversation" with Netanyahu and "praised his speech (on Sunday) as an important first step towards realizing a two-state solution" meaning the establishment of a Palestinian state, said government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm.</p>
<p>"She hopes that the road will now open up for the start of corresponding negotiations, during which those questions that remain up for discussion can be resolved," Wilhelm added in a statement.</p>
<p>Netanyahu on Sunday endorsed for the first time the creation of a Palestinian state, provided it was demilitarized, after weeks of pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>COUNTRIES PLEDGE TO FIGHT TALIBAN</p>
<p>YEKATERINBURG, Russia - Russia, Pakistan and Afghan-istan called for stronger regional co-operation in fighting the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama has made better international co-operation on Afghanistan an important element of his plan to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan, where violence is at its worst level since U.S.-led forces toppled the Islamists in 2001.</p>
<p>"I think what is missing in this war ... is that the neighbours haven't been involved, the region has not been involved," Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said at the start of the meeting on the sidelines of a regional conference.</p>
<p>BANKER'S VOICE HEARD IN COURT</p>
<p>GENEVA - The voice of a French banker shot dead by his lover during a sado-masochistic sex session rang out Monday from beyond the grave across a Geneva courtroom, reducing his killer to tears.</p>
<p>Edouard Stern, one of France's wealthiest men whose influential circle of friends included President Nicolas Sarkozy, was found dead at his Geneva penthouse in March 2005 wearing a latex suit, with two bullet holes in his head and another two in his torso.</p>
<p>His 40-year-old lover, Cecile Brossard, eventually confessed to the killing.</p>
<p>Brossard cried as the jury heard telephone messages left by Stern on her answer phone. "I will always be there for you, and I ask you always to be there for me," the banker said in a message recorded two days before she killed him.</p>
<p>SWINE FLU RESULTS FALSE, CROATIA SAYS</p>
<p>ZAGREB - The Croatian government said Monday it was forced to retract its announcement of the country's first swine flu case after the London laboratory that conducted the test said the results were wrong.</p>
<p>"It is clear who has made a mistake. When we received lab results from a referal centre for Europe in London, we had to inform the Croatian public within an hour" that the results were positive, Health Minister Darko Milinovic told national television.</p>
<p>YEMEN HOSTAGES DEAD, GERMANS SAY</p>
<p>BERLIN - German intelligence services believe that all nine hostages taken in Yemen have been killed by al-Qaida, a German daily reports.</p>
<p>According to Sueddeutsche Zeitung, the German intelligence services are basing their conclusions on the "brutality" of the kidnappers.</p>
<p>"The Germans are particularly in al-Qaida's line of fire. Al-Qaida is intensifying things. We should prepare ourselves for additional deaths," an unnamed expert is quoted as saying by the newspaper.</p>
<p>Several television stations said late Monday that all nine kidnap victims had been killed, although no official announcement of deaths has yet been made.</p>
<p>FINNISH MPS BACK ALCOHOL TAX HIKE</p>
<p>HELSINKI - Finland's parliament unanimously agreed to hike alcohol taxes by up to 10 per cent Monday in an effort to curb excessive drinking, the leading cause of death in the Nordic country.</p>
<p>The move represents the second such rise this year and will be effective in October.</p>
<p>The amount tax levied depends on a drink's alcohol content with the price of beer and wine set to rise by three per cent and spirits by seven per cent.</p>
<p>Taxation on alcohol in Finland is among the highest in Europe after Sweden and Ireland.</p>
<p>WAITRESS WINS CASE OVER TIGHT DRESS</p>
<p>LONDON - A Muslim cocktail waitress won a US$4,900 compensation payout Monday for having to wear a figure-hugging red dress she said made her feel "like a prostitute."</p>
<p>Lemes, 33, worked at the Rocket Bar in Mayfair, central London, for barely a week last year. When she started, female staff wore a loose-fitting uniform, but she was told this would change in the summer.</p>
<p>The summer outfit turned out to be a tight-fitting red dress -- which she refused to wear, saying it was "disgusting."</p>
<p>WOMAN BUSTED FOR ABUSE ON WEBCAM</p>
<p>LONDON - British detectives said on Monday an investigation into Internet child pornography had uncovered a woman in the United States suspected of using a webcam to broadcast live sexual abuse of her young child.</p>
<p>British police launched the investigation last Thursday when officers arrested an 18-year-old man in central England, who was later charged with possessing and distributing abusive images of children.</p>
<p>The following day, detectives contacted Britain's Child Exploitation Online Protection agency and the U.S. Embassy, leading to the arrest of the woman in Maine.</p>
<p>POT SHOP OWNER FACES NOV. TRIAL</p>
<p>THE HAGUE - A Dutch coffee shop owner will face trial in November for allegedly storing more than the allowed amount of cannabis on site in what has been seen as a test case, a court official said Monday.</p>
<p>The owner of Checkpoint in Terneuzen, the Netherlands' largest coffee shop, will stand trial with staff members and suppliers after investigators said they found 120 kilograms of marijuana on the premises in 2007 and another 110 kilos last year.</p>
<p>The coffee shop is one of about 700 licensed to sell cannabis. They are allowed to keep 500 grams on site, but the limit has often been flouted.</p>
<p>PRINCESS'S HUSBAND DENIES ASSAULT</p>
<p>HILDESHEIM, Germany, - Princess Caroline of Monaco's husband Prince Ernst August of Hanover denied in court on Monday drunkenly beating up a hotel manager with a knuckle duster on the Kenyan island of Lamu in 2000.</p>
<p>The German aristocrat, a distant relation of Britain's queen, said through his lawyer at his retrial in Germany that he gave Josef Brunlehner "two symbolic slaps" because he was annoyed about the noise and laser show at the hotel disco.</p>
<p>"One for the music and one for the light," the 55-year-old said.</p>
<p>But he said that accusations that he then assaulted the 60-year-old German under the influence of alcohol were "grotesque inventions and lies."</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>MUSICIANS ATTACKED AT AFGHAN WEDDING</p>
<p>JALALABAD, Afghanistan - Taliban fighters beat musicians, shaved their heads and left them tied to trees overnight because they performed at an Afghan wedding, a village tribal chief said Monday, a sign of the fighters' growing influence.</p>
<p>While in power from 1996-2001, the Taliban banned music as un-Islamic.</p>
<p>"A party was going on when a group of Taliban grabbed five musicians and started beating them and smashing their musical instruments," said Rahmatullah Khan, a head of Merke Khel village in the east of the country.</p>
<p>"The musicians were tied up with rope to trees last night and villagers found them in the morning when going out for prayers," Khan said.</p>
<p>FIVE KILLED IN IRAQ ATTACKS</p>
<p>BAGHDAD - Five people, including an Iraqi soldier, were killed and 14 wounded in violence across Iraq on Monday, security officials said.</p>
<p>In one attack near Tarmiyah, a Sunni district north of Baghdad, an anti-tank rocket was fired at a convoy carrying the leader of a local militia opposed to al-Qaida.</p>
<p>Two bodyguards were killed and three were wounded, but the militia chief Sheikh Jassem al-Mashahadani emerged unscathed, police lieutenant Sarmed Sami said.</p>
<p>GEMS DONATED TO HOLOCAUST MUSEUM</p>
<p>JERUSALEM - A 95-year-old Auschwitz survivor donated jewlery he took from the clothing of Jews who were gassed to death at the Nazi camp to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum on Monday.</p>
<p>Polish-born Meyer Hack, who now lives in Boston, found the gems while sorting the clothing of victims sent to die in the gas chambers, which was his job at the camp where his mother, brother and two sisters perished.</p>
<p>He hid the eight rings, watches and brooches of diamond and gold beneath his barracks.</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
<p>12-YEAR-OLD KILLED IN N. MEXICO</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico - An armed commando killed a 12-year-old girl and three others in a car in north Mexico, adding to four other suspected drug-related deaths in the region, local officials said Monday.</p>
<p>The attack occurred some 20 kilometres from the notoriously violent border city of Ciudad Juarez, where more than 760 murders have been reported so far this year despite the presence of some 8,500 troops.</p>
<p>Four men died in separate incidents Sunday in the same northern state of Chihuahua.</p>

<p>UN TACKLES SEX CRIMES IN CONGO</p>
<p>KINSHASA - A UN envoy on Monday urged the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to empower women politically and socially to help them fight the high rate of sexual crime in the country.</p>
<p>"You have to promote the participation of women in governement, in the electoral process, in politics ... and strengthen the status of women to settle issues of sexual violence," said Helen Clark, the administrator of the UN Development Program.</p>

<p>The RCMP Academy "Depot" Division in Regina reported that there were three possible new cases of H1N1 flu infection among its cadets as of Monday morning.</p>
<p>Three cadets who were suffering from influenza-like symptoms were placed in isolation, bringing the total number of trainees in isolation up to 11, according to Sgt. Alain LeBlanc, official spokesman for the RCMP's "Depot" Division.</p>
<p>On Sunday, 15 cadets previously isolated amid concerns of H1N1/swine flu infection were released from isolation.</p>
<p>The outbreak at the RCMP Academy was initially made public on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a media release, LeBlanc indicated the situation will continue to be monitored closely and the public will be advised of any significant changes at the academy.</p>

<p>Upon learning the city is working on a "natural death surge strategy," a set of protocols to help manage the sudden influx of corpses expected during a serious influenza pandemic, my first thought was of Monty Python's infamous "Bring Out Your Dead (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grbSQ6O6kbs[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grbSQ6O6kbs])" sketch.</p>
<p>Of course, a flu pandemic is no laughing matter, especially after the World Health Organization has just declared its first one since 1968.</p>
<p>The illness-formerly-known-as-swine-flu has spread like wildfire but been mercifully mild to date, as health officials are apt to repeat. (I sometimes find their efforts to curtail public panic so obvious and patronizing I just want to scream, "Give me the facts and only the facts.")</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WestJet heats up rivalry in North; Low airfares may push others out of business, says one competitor</b>
</div><div>Gina Teel   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>908 words</div><div>15 June 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>D8 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Yellowknife is a city of about 20,000 people who, as of last month, were enjoying the spoils of cheap airfares, the result of having a fourth carrier touch down in the northern hub.</p>
<p>The arrival of <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>., which launched seasonal non-stop service between Edmonton and Yellowknife in May, marked the Calgary-based carrier's entry into Canada's North -- albeit into a market with arguably little elbow room.</p>
<p>Yellowknife's airport, which last year saw 400,000 passenger movements -- a fraction of what Calgary and Edmonton's airports command -- is now serviced by WestJet, <span class="companylink">Air Canada Jazz</span> and northern airlines including Canadian North and First Air.</p>
<p>"I defy you to find another market in Canada with the per-capita air service from jet aircraft that Yellowknife gets right now," said Chris Ferris, First Air's vice-president for marketing and sales.</p>
<p>For northern carriers, Yellowknife is a hub for their networks serving points further beyond in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Arctic -- routes underpinned by the Edmonton-to-Yellowknife leg.</p>
<p>The glut in capacity on this key southern leg has sparked an airfare war that's brought unprecedented low prices from Yellowknife, where traditionally it's been cheaper for families to drive the 1,524 kilometres to Edmonton.</p>
<p>The northern carriers say the bargain-basement airfares aren't sustainable in the long-term, and could potentially affect their northern connections and local economies.</p>
<p>First Air and Canadian North are aboriginally-owned and each have a mandate to provide reliable air service to the North, as well as economic and employment opportunities to the communities.</p>
<p>"We're not here to compete with carriers in the south. We're not in a position to do that," said Tracy Medve, president of Canadian North.</p>
<p>The deep discounting is especially irksome, the Northern carriers say, as WestJet entered the Yellowknife market for one reason: to compete head-to-head with rival Air Canada for market share.</p>
<p>"There's no other reason now for them to be in Yellowknife but that," Medve said.</p>
<p>Richard Bartrem, WestJet's vice-president for culture and communications, said that's not how the airline makes decisions.</p>
<p>"We are a rational and caring airline that brings its value proposition to Canadians according to a plan that is economic and sustainable," he said.</p>
<p>WestJet's trial run into Yellowknife -- the seasonal service ends in October and airline officials have said they'll review the numbers then -- also comes after talks about a possible code-share arrangement with Canadian North failed.</p>
<p>Medve said Canadian North isn't anti-competition -- in fact, it has grown in the face of competition from First Air over the years.</p>
<p>"Competition is good," she said. "It keeps you honest and it keeps you smart, but this is beyond what we can deal with."</p>
<p>The situation also comes at a time when travel and tourism are down, due to the recession and concerns over the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>All in all, there are 10 flights a day between Calgary, Edmonton and Yellowknife. That's close to 5,000 seats per week in the Yellowknife market.</p>
<p>Northwest Territories' Department of Transportation officials had no opinion on whether the Yellowknife airport is over-served.</p>
<p>"The only people that can really decide whether there are too many flights or too many carriers are the passengers who support the airlines," said department spokesman Earl Blacklock.</p>
<p>WestJet's launch into Yellowknife came with an introductory fare of $149 return to Edmonton. Canadian North had fares in the market in the $250 and $260 range one-way before WestJet entered the market.</p>
<p>Medve said such low airfares create a false expectation about what the airfares should be, and that in turn creates issues for northern carriers in other communities they serve.</p>
<p>Customers are asking why they can fly between Yellowknife and Edmonton on WestJet for $75 one way, when Canadian North charges so much more.</p>
<p>"They can't, really, and neither can we," she said.</p>
<p>Medve said if the current low fare landscape persists in the longer-term, someone will have to cut capacity.</p>
<p>Then the question becomes: "Who's not going to be there anymore?" she said.</p>
<p>Air service is essential in the north, she said, given there's three million square kilometres of land and less than 2,000 kilometres of road.</p>
<p>Canadian North is well-positioned to survive the current fracas, "but it won't be pretty," she said.</p>
<p>Air Canada operates two flights per day out of Calgary to Yellowknife and one from Edmonton with the 50-seat Jazz aircraft.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Angela Mah wouldn't discuss route profitability but did say Air Canada competes "very effectively in all markets that we fly into."</p>
<p>Peter Neugebauer, Yellowknife's director of economic development, said in his view, competition is generally a good thing.</p>
<p>The arrival of Canadian Tire and <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, for instance, has helped lower the cost of living in Yellowknife, and residents now enjoy national pricing as a result.</p>
<p>"The perfect world would be competing airlines with more affordable fares for both residents and tourism and business travel," Neugebauer said.</p>

<p>An Australian lacrosse team was placed under quarantine in South Korea after a player tested positive for swine flu, jeopardizing its chances of playing in an international tournament in Seoul this week, officials said Sunday. The 19-year-old player has been in a hospital since Saturday, when he tested positive for the virus after arriving at Incheon International Airport near Seoul, Health Ministry official Park Il-hun said. He said none of the 26 others in the party -- including family members -- displayed symptoms of swine flu, also known as influenza A(H1N1), but were put in isolation as a precaution. The team arrived in South Korea from Melbourne via Hong Kong. The one-week quarantine period for the Australians means that the under-21 men's national team will likely miss the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Tournament, which is schedule to start on Tuesday.</p>

<p>British authorities confirmed Sunday the first swine flu death outside the Americas, marking a new stage in the spread of the virus that has infected almost 30,000 people worldwide. Three days after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, the government in Scotland said an infected patient who also had "underlying health conditions" had died in hospital.</p>

She reportedly lived in Montreal and died Saturday in hospital. Also this weekend, Newfoundland and Labrador confirmed its first case of H1N1. A young man, who has since recovered, recently went to the hospital in Grand Falls-Windsor reporting flu symptoms that were confirmed as stemming from H1N1.</p>

<p>Canada's economy has traditionally relied on manufacturing and natural resources, particularly forestry and agriculture. So when the global recession hit, Ottawa started coming through with support. The auto sector teetered on the brink of collapse; Canadians shelled out $10 billion. Then last week, forestry received $1 billion.</p>
<p>And as for agriculture -- especially the export-dependent pork industry, which has been ravaged through no fault of its own by the economic crisis, a strong Canadian dollar, trade restrictions, and the ill-named swine flu (H1N1) -- well, it's still waiting.</p>
<p>That's baffling. Canada's pork producers are struggling, and it seems as if they're encountering more brick walls than support.</p>
<p>Back in May, with the walls crashing down, the Canadian Pork Council pleaded with the federal government to help by giving pig farmers $30 per animal in support. That was said to total about $800 million, which is what the council believes the industry needs to survive.</p>
<p>Admittedly, that's a lot of money, and there's certainly a tendency to wonder who's next in line. But the chips are really down for pork. Canada's hog herd has dropped by more than 15 per cent in the last three years, due mainly to chronically low prices and tightening markets. This decline was happening even before H1N1 came along and knocked the stuffing out the industry.</p>
<p>Pork producers couldn't do anything about H1N1. They were as helpless as the cattle producers who were hammered in 2003 when a sole Alberta animal tested positive for mad cow disease. The federal government came through then with a huge payment for farmers. So did the province.</p>
<p>But now that pork is on the skids, Ottawa says it's going to help by spending $50 million to support additional pork-processing capacity, instead of bankrolling a bailout.</p>
<p>Practically, additional capacity doesn't make sense right now. Indeed, plants have closed down and made a mess of traditional processing patterns. But more capacity is only one answer to the problem. Immediate help is imperative.</p>
<p>Politicians must understand the pork sector's contributions. Ontario Pork says the industry provides employment for 33,000 Ontarians and infuses $4.7 billion into the province's economy. The pork industry is progressive, research-intensive and big business. Statistics Canada says almost 18 per cent of hog farms have more than $1 million in income.</p>
<p>In that strata, pork has a higher percentage of farms than any agricultural sector. Some people argue against the proliferation of big hog farms, but there's no question about their role in the economy. "To lose this industry would be a significant blow to Ontario at an already difficult time," says Ontario Pork chair Wilma Jeffray.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada says agricultural and fishing product exports rose five per cent through April, and helped moderate the overall decline in exports. If Canada is going to count on farming to pull it out of the recession, the industry needs support.</p>
<p>In spirit, support for the pork industry is there. Long lines of politicians have been seen attending and participating in well-publicized pork barbecues over the past month, to rally support for pig farmers and dispel any relationship between pork consumption and H1N1. They've spoken out in favour of the industry, and they're being petitioned by the council to help expand trade into markets such as the European Union.</p>
<p>And while publicity is important, so is financial commitment. The federal agriculture minister has been front and centre at barbecues and on Parliament Hill, giving the sector his blessings. But he's also been quoted as saying the kind of per-head payment requested by the pork council is a non-starter in today's trade and economic environment.</p>
<p>Then what is? Pork producers need help, just like other sectors. And they need it soon. Ottawa, over to you.</p>

</p>
<p>The following editorial ran in the Waterloo Region Record.</p>
<p>For most Canadians, the fact that the H1N1 flu outbreak has been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization is a mere technicality, and no wonder. With less than 3,000 confirmed cases nationwide as of Friday, few Canadians know anyone who has caught the virus, (inappropriately) also known as swine flu, let alone fallen ill from it themselves.</p>
<p>So, despite this week's announcement by the World Health Organization, most people in this country will have already heeded the advice of federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq not to worry about this flu which, in the words of infectious disease expert Dr. Donald Low, has been "relatively mild.''</p>
<p>First Nations Canadians, however, will not and cannot be so blase. And their plight warrants attention and action from the highest levels of government, as well as the general public.</p>
<p>Both in terms of the number of people affected and the severity of their cases, the hammer of the H1N1 flu outbreak in Canada is falling disproportionately hard on aboriginal communities, particularly ones in the north. Aboriginal leaders in northeastern Manitoba say come communities there are in full pandemic mode. . . .</p>
<p>Aglukkaq, the health minister who is an aboriginal from the North, says health officials are working with First Nations leaders to deal with the outbreaks in their communities. This may be so. But when the pandemic is over, Canadians should not forget the deplorable conditions in these communities and the responsibility to help fellow citizens whose geographic remoteness cannot diminish their unquestionable human value.</p>

<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>The global influenza pandemic marched on through the weekend with reports of the first death outside of the Americas, two more deaths in Quebec and the arrival of the virus in Newfoundland and Labrador, the latest – and last – province or territory to report a confirmed case of influenza A/H1N1.</p>
<p>Public health officials will announce today the pandemic has travelled coast-to-coast-to-coast just seven weeks after the first case was reported.</p>
<p>“As other Canadian jurisdictions have recorded cases of H1N1 influenza, we anticipated it would be only a matter of time before Newfoundland and Labrador recorded its first case,” Faith Stratton, the province's chief medical officer of health, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We should expect to see other cases over the summer months and into the fall flu season,” she said, reinforcing the message that the presence of H1N1 should be considered the new normal.</p>
<p>Dr. Stratton said the public should not be “overly concerned” as most cases are mild.</p>
<p>Officials would only say that a man was treated at Grand Falls-Windsor hospital in central Newfoundland and he has since recovered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec announced yesterday that there had been two new deaths from H1N1 flu in the province over the weekend, bringing the Canadian death toll to six.</p>
<p>Alain Poirier, Quebec's director of public health, said a woman in her 50s and a man in his 40s had died of H1N1.</p>
<p>He noted that both suffered from chronic health conditions that made them vulnerable to the virus.</p>
<p>Data from the United States show that virtually all H1N1 deaths have occurred in middle-aged people with chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease.</p>
<p>Yesterday also marked another grim milestone, with the first reported H1N1 death outside of the Americas. The Scottish health department said in a statement that a patient had died, but provided no further details except to say he suffered from an underlying health condition.</p>
<p>As of Friday, there had been 145 swine flu deaths reported worldwide. Until the weekend, fatalities had occurred only in eight countries of the Americas: Mexico, the United States, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Guatemala.</p>
<p>The latest published data show a total of 3,515 cases of H1N1 influenza across Canada. Worldwide, the number of cases stood at 29,669 as of Friday night.</p>
<p>Both the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization will release up-to-date numbers later today and they will be significantly higher.</p>
<p>“There is no evidence that the numbers are going down,” Dr. Poirier said. “We haven't yet reached the peak of this epidemic.”</p>
<p>In fact, Canada is the country where H1N1 continues to spread most rapidly in the world, followed by Australia and Argentina.</p>
<p>And travellers from Canada are bringing the virus elsewhere. On the weekend, Morocco became the latest country to report H1N1. Both cases in that country were among travellers on a flight from Montreal to Casablanca on June 10.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the WHO declared a phase six pandemic alert (on a scale of six), meaning the world was officially in the midst of a global pandemic of influenza for the first time in four decades.</p>
<p>Health officials stressed, however, that phase six is a reflection of the geographic spread of the virus, not its severity.</p>
<p>But Canadians and international infectious disease experts have stressed that influenza is unpredictable and the virus could grow more lethal over time.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First Nations flu outbreak on radar screen - Senator to push for hearing this week</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The outbreak of H1N1 influenza in Manitoba First Nations was a big topic in question period last week.</p>
<p>At least seven questions were posed to the government by a number of MPs, some of whom weren't even from Manitoba.</p>
<p>That's not an easy feat considering the flu outbreak had stiff competition -- including the Lisa Raitt tape fiasco, the second report card on the economic stimulus package, the anniversary of the apology for residential schools and the shortage of medical isotopes because of the shutdown of the nuclear reactor at Chalk River.</p>
<p>Even Senator Sharon Carstairs got in on the act asking questions on both Wednesday and Thursday in the upper chamber about the slow detection of, and reaction to, the outbreak in Island Lake and the reports of a shortage of medical supplies such as hand sanitizer and face masks.</p>
<p>Don't look for it to cool down this week either.</p>
<p>Carstairs is intent on getting the Senate standing committee on aboriginal peoples to hold a committee hearing on the subject this week.</p>
<p>It certainly couldn't hurt for Parliament to take a look at how Canada can get a Disaster Assistance Response Team to Sri Lanka within two weeks of the tsunami that hit south Asia in 2004 but it took a month for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch to study what type of hand sanitizer to send to Island Lake, just a few hundred kilometres north of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Winnipeg NDP MP Pat Martin has a number of different pet projects, including banning trans fats and getting rid of the penny. But none of his causes raise his hackles more than asbestos.</p>
<p>Martin worked in asbestos mines in the Yukon when he was in his early 20s and he has scarring on his lungs that requires regular chest X-rays.</p>
<p>For years, he has battled the government -- both the current Conservative one and the former Liberal government -- to ban the product.</p>
<p>Last week, after CBC The National aired a feature on Canada's exports of the product to developing nations, Martin again made his plea, writing a scathing letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper practically begging for the ban.</p>
<p>"Not only does Canada want to keep exporting human misery on a monumental scale, they don't want anyone putting warning labels on asbestos or implying that it will kill you," he wrote. "This makes me hang my head in shame as a Canadian."</p>
<p>He was talking about Canada's refusal to add chrysotile asbestos -- the form still mined at one location in Quebec -- to an international treaty. It would force Canada to warn countries it exports to about the dangers of the product.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem it will have much impact.</p>
<p>Christian Paradis, the minister of public works, stood in the House of Commons to answer a question from Martin.</p>
<p>"The policy is clear and has not changed," Paradis said in French. "We promote the safe use of chrysotile asbestos here, in Canada, and all over the world."</p>
<p>Paradis isn't just a cabinet minister. He's Harper's Quebec lieutenant, and the MP representing the area in Quebec that is home to the mine.</p>
<p>Banning asbestos would put the mine out of business and several hundred people out of work.</p>
<p>Not exactly something a political party wants to do when it is already facing a free fall in support in Quebec, and a recession with more than 300,000 Canadians already out of work because of the faltering economy.</p>
<p>It's garden party season in Ottawa. The time of year that has the nation's leaders inviting reporters over for an evening of schmoozing and small talk.</p>
<p>In the last week, both Harper and Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff invited the media over, but in very different fashions.</p>
<p>Ignatieff had an after-work affair at Stornoway, the official residence of the leader of the opposition, with entertainment provided by high school musicians from his Toronto riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore and a cheese bar to make any dairy lover weep with gratitude.</p>
<p>In contrast, Harper held a Saturday afternoon family fair at 24 Sussex Drive, complete with bouncy castle and cotton candy for the kids, and hot dogs, lobster rolls and cookies even the Pillsbury Doughboy might envy for their softness.</p>
<p>Harper, whose hate-hate relationship with the media is well-documented, nevertheless put on a brave smile to welcome press gallery members and their families, posing for countless photos.</p>
<p>It is one of the less enviable parts of his job -- having to stand for hours and glad-hand. In 2008, he said he posed for 17,000 official photographs at various receptions and events.</p>
<p>That's a lot of "cheese."</p>

<p>jtimson@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Here is a variation on the old “if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, will it make a sound?” question: If the World Health Organization finally declares swine flu to be a global pandemic, as it did last week, but many of us overdosed weeks ago on swine-flu information, not to mention misinformation, will anybody care?</p>
<p>The answer is that many people won't give a rat's ass (or perhaps I should say a pig's hoof) because they are now at a completely different place in their personal information cycle vis-à-vis the swine-flu thing. They've moved on.</p>
<p>Moving on – from major world-threatening events, from big splashy crime stories, from political imbroglios and even from Susan Boyle – has now become a key survival tool in the post-information age.</p>
<p>I say “post,” because “information age” – surely a passé term, anyway – hardly feels like an adequate description of the unprecedented daily – no, hourly – feed of news, views and gossip coming at us through old and new media sources.</p>
<p>The torrent is so relentless, there's even too much information about those new media sources. If I have to read one thing more about how to Twitter, I will scream.</p>
<p>Today the news cycle is nasty, brutish and, above all, short: Blink and you may miss which Canadian politician called which life-threatening medical issue “sexy” and have to sit out the next dinner-party conversation. (Mind you, on the flip side, every single misdeed by a public person lurks forever in Internet archives, ready to rear up and bite a promising career over and over again.)</p>
<p>The most screwy thing is how the speed at which we move on often diminishes our capacity to really feel for others. I was taken aback in March when less than 10 days after the tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson in a skiing accident at Mont Tremblant, a young woman at one social gathering asked almost callously, “Why are we still talking about this? Isn't this over?” (I wanted to respond, “It's not over for me because her death touched me, and it still does.” But the table had already moved on to – what was it? Oh yes: Who Twittered?)</p>
<p>How we absorb, cope with, process and personally curate our information these days is worthy of its own academic discipline. A few years ago, David Levy, a professor at the Information School at the University of Washington, coined the phrase “information environmentalism,” which means we need to at least be conscious of what we're absorbing and ask ourselves whether we really need to know whatever it is that is consuming the airwaves.</p>
<p>Many busy people I know seriously triage information, deciding what they will not even attempt to grasp. I recently drew the line at something called Jon & Kate Plus 8 that seems to be currently commanding too much attention, and I think I am a far better person for it. (And please, don't write in and tell me what it is – I really don't care.) Another strategy might be to delegate some specific information absorption to others: “Hey, can you let me know if I need to worry again about swine flu?”)</p>
<p>In a funny example of how much our information streaming and rate of absorption has changed, I experienced a dislocating moment last month when I heard that Elizabeth Edwards, wife of disgraced and unfaithful former U.S. Democratic leadership candidate John Edwards, had given a soul-baring interview to Oprah about her new book. For days I read about this interview online and even watched an excerpt. But for some frustrating reason – I figured it was my own ineptitude – I could not find the entire interview to download. Finally, I figured out why: It hadn't happened yet! In other words, I had been absorbing first hype and promo, then “news” about the hype and promo, when the actual interview in its entirety was only due to be aired later that week.</p>
<p>It's no wonder then, that in the midst of this relentlessly churning information cycle that people get confused. They either yawn and say, “Swine flu? Why are we still talking about this? Isn't it over?” Or they feel eternally restless, asking themselves and each other in a kind of mass ADD moment: “What's next?”</p>
<p>To which, my heartfelt answer is, I haven't a clue, but I'll let you know as soon as I do. It just might be swine flu.</p>

</p>
<p>I took a group of teenage girls to an Ottawa shopping centre last week, where I noticed a public dispenser of hand sanitizer. Before heading to the stores, I made them douse their hands, my concession to the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>That was probably the last thought I gave to the flu, at least until I began reading reports out of northern Manitoba of a very different experience with H1N1.</p>
<p>In St. Theresa Point, a fly-in community about 500 kilometres north of Winnipeg, the flu is not something that can be wiped away with a squirt of hand sanitizer. It has taken hold with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Almost 30 people from the community of 3,200 have been airlifted to Winnipeg, where many have required respirators. One pregnant woman is in critical condition and has lost her baby. Schools, community centres and gatherings have been shut down in an attempt to prevent further spread. But, given living conditions there, that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>For years, critics have decried the conditions in which many of Canada's First Nations live, particularly in the remote North. With H1N1, Canada's north-south divide has never been so starkly obvious.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the flu will be little more than an inconvenience for most. Some may become seriously ill and a few, with underlying health problems, might even die. But it is highly unlikely the community will become overwhelmed. We are being told, rightly, to be vigilant, but not to panic. "We can assure people that, in a general sense, for the vast majority of them, this is a business-as-usual type of experience," says Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical health officer.</p>
<p>Levy is right. As a community, we are sheltered from the worst the world can throw at us by a protective bubble that most of us don't even realize is there.</p>
<p>It is not luck that allows us to brush off the kinds of illnesses that regularly devastate poorer parts of the world.</p>
<p>We are protected by a functioning health-care system, plentiful fresh food, clean, running water, available housing -- things that we take for granted and demand as Canadians.</p>
<p>So why do we find it so easy to shrug our shoulders when it becomes clear that this protective bubble does not extend to many of Canada's First Nations communities, where running water and adequate housing are luxuries?</p>
<p>The story that has put remote St. Theresa Point on the map is not really about flu. It is about poverty, substandard living conditions and a country that prefers not to look too closely at this widening poverty gap. It is a story that should make southern Canadians feel ashamed. The flu has acted as an uncomfortable highlighter.</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point First Nation Chief David McDougall held a press conference this week to talk about this situation in his community. He said lack of housing -- "It's common for 12 people to try and fit in a two-bedroom bungalow" -- and a lack of proper medical facilities make the region a powder keg when an infectious disease hits. H1N1 has lit the match.</p>
<p>"It's a wake-up call for everyone," he said. "We've stressed this over the years, saying this is an emergency or a catastrophe waiting to happen and now we're seeing it."</p>
<p>It is difficult to stop disease from spreading once it gets into communities such as St. Theresa Point because everyone must fly in and out of the community on the same plane and there is a housing shortage.</p>
<p>In many remote communities, there is not enough clean water, which rules out frequent hand washing as a first line of defence.</p>
<p>And then there are chronic underlying diseases such as diabetes and tuberculosis which affect Canada's native population at a much higher rate than the rest of the country.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the World Health Organization warned that H1N1 could be a disaster for poor parts of the world.</p>
<p>WHO director general Margaret Chan was talking about parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America when she asked: "What will happen if sudden surges in the number of people requiring care for influenza push already fragile health services over the brink?"</p>
<p>She could also have been talking about many aboriginal communities in Canada's North.</p>
<p>The flu outbreak in St. Theresa Point -- which is among the most functional and best served First Nations communities in its area -- has drawn attention to the gaping need. Doctors and medicine are being flown in and patients flown out.</p>
<p>But simply treating the flu will do little to prevent another health crisis. Communities like St. Theresa Point need better health services, better housing, better schools and clean water.</p>
<p>Our country's health gap is something that can't be washed away.</p>

<p>IRAN CRACKDOWN SHOCKS AMNESTY</p>
<p>LONDON -- Amnesty International called Sunday for Iranian authorities to immediately investigate a crackdown on de-monstrators by the security forces after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election.</p>
<p>"The shocking scenes of violence meted out by the security forces need to be urgently investigated and those responsible for human rights violations must be brought to justice," said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa program.</p>
<p>The London-based rights organization said it had reports of plain-clothes security forces using batons to disperse supporters of Ahmadinejad's closest challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi, who protested the election result on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police said they had rounded up 170 people over the protests, which triggered violence on a scale not seen since 1999.</p>
<p>"Amnesty International considers anyone arrested simply for demanding transparency and for questioning the results of the elections to be a prisoner of conscience, who should be immediately and unconditionally released."</p>
<p>FRANCE CONFIRMS 7 SWINE FLU CASES</p>
<p>TOULOUSE -- French officials on Sunday confirmed seven cases of swine flu in a group of children from the same school in an outbreak that did not appear to have been brought in from abroad.</p>
<p>The cases from the outbreak led to 13 children, all aged around 11, being hospitalized in the southwest of the country with suspected A(H1N1) infections.</p>
<p>So far seven of the students, all from Quint-Fonsegrives, close to Toulouse, have been confirmed as having the infection after the group was taken in overnight Saturday.</p>
<p>The remaining six students are considered "probable" cases, local authorities said, but their teacher tested negative.</p>
<p>The children have also been given anti-viral medication, local authorities said.</p>
<p>"The unique thing about this situation is that these cases are not linked to a trip abroad. The virus is present in our country," said Anne-Gaelle Baudouin-Clerc, chief of staff to the prefect of the Haute Garonne region.</p>
<p>The seven confirmed infections bring to 87 the number of reported swine flu cases in France since the end of April -- the vast majority of which were linked to people who had returned from travel abroad.</p>
<p>RIVAS SHOOTING BEING PROBED</p>
<p>CARACAS -- Venezuelan prosecutors said Sunday they have opened an investigation into the killing of an opposition leader and the wounding of two other people during a protest on Saturday.</p>
<p>Jhonathan Rivas, 31, a leader of the Primero Justicia party, was shot and killed in El Tigre, 320 kilometres southeast of Caracas, while protesting the arrest of opposition activists.</p>
<p>The arrests came in the midst of an opposition campaign to raise donations over the weekend to pay for fines imposed on Globovision, a private television network embroiled in a legal struggle with the government of President Hugo Chavez.</p>
<p>Gustavo Marcano, a co-ordinator for Primero Justicia in the region, blamed "armed bands" of Chavez supporters for the shootings.</p>
<p>EGYPT TO 'PROVE' NEFERTITI STOLEN</p>
<p>BERLIN -- Egypt will soon provide evidence that the 3,400-year-old bust of Queen Nefertiti was taken illegally out of the country by Germany, Egyptian antiquities chief Zahi Hawass said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"We are still gathering information, but I expect we will shortly have enough to place a formal request to the Berlin Museum for the return of the bust," Hawass told the Tagess-piegel in an interview.</p>
<p>The fabled bust of Nefertiti was brought to Berlin in 1913, a year after German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt unearthed it on the banks of the Nile.</p>
<p>Cairo began demanding the statue in the 1930s, but successive German governments, beginning with Adolf Hitler's, have refused its request.</p>
<p>"There do not appear to be any documents that prove conclusively that Nefertiti left Egypt in a way that was legal and beyond ethical reproach. I think we have good arguments for her return," Hawass added.</p>
<p>ENDEAVOUR TO LAUNCH WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL -- NASA said Sunday it was aiming for a Wednesday launch for the space shuttle Endeavour after the mission to the International Space Station was postponed over a hydrogen leak.</p>
<p>Shuttle launch director Pete Nickolenko said the root cause of the leak in Endeavour's external fuel tank had not yet been determined but that the team was "confident" that repair procedures for a similar leak on space shuttle Discovery in March would work for the current mission.</p>
<p>Technicians at NASA's Kennedy Space Center were expected to complete the repairs today.</p>

</p>
<p>A Montreal man in his 40s is the second person in Quebec to die of the swine flu.</p>
<p>Public Health Department director Alain Poirier announced the man died yesterday after contracting the H1N1 strain of the flu that has infected at least 833 people in Quebec, an increase of 131 from the previous day.</p>
<p>A total of 118 people have been hospitalized with the virus.</p>
<p>Poirier said the man was already sick with another illness, but for confidentiality reasons refused to go into details about his health.</p>
<p>"He had an underlying disease that lowered his immunity," Poirier said.</p>
<p>The nationwide death toll from the flu now stands at five.</p>
<p>On Monday, Poirier confirmed the province's first death - a woman over the age of 65 from the Quebec City area - also had bacterial pneumonia, which contributed to her death. She died on June 5.</p>
<p>Additionally, Morocco reported its second swine flu infection yesterday.</p>
<p>The new case is "a young Moroccan man, 29 years old, who returned from Canada in the same plane" as a young woman diagnosed on Thursday as the first case with the virus in the north African country, a health ministry statement said.</p>
<p>The second case was discovered during checks of the passengers on the June 10 flight from Montreal to Casablanca, the ministry added.</p>
<p>He has been hospitalized in Casablanca and is said to be in stable condition.</p>
<p>The first patient, an 18-year-old woman who had been studying in Montreal, and members of her family have been placed in quarantine for eight to 10 days in Fez, about 200 kilometres east of the capital, Rabat.</p>
<p>Health officials said yesterday she has been treated with anti-virals and her condition has improved.</p>
<p>England had a further 67 cases yesterday, pushing the total to 1,121, the Department of Health said.</p>
<p>The so-called swine flu has so far infected almost 30,000 people in 74 countries and claimed 145 lives since it was first detected in Mexico in April, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>Teen seriously injured</p>
<p>in Brampton stabbing</p>
<p>A teen was in serious condition after being stabbed in the chest in Brampton Friday night.</p>
<p>Just before 11 p.m. Peel police were called to Torrance Woods near Chinguacousy Rd. and Steeles Ave. W., where they say six teens were involved in a fight.</p>
<p>Three teens, including the victim, face several assault charges.</p>
<p>The victim is expected to recover, police said.</p>
<p>Toronto</p>
<p>Driver charged after</p>
<p>motorcyclist struck</p>
<p>A 45-year-old motorcyclist was taken to hospital after he was struck by a car and thrown from his bike while driving on Leslie St., south of Sheppard Ave. E.</p>
<p>The victim was driving north on Leslie St. around 11 p.m. Friday when an oncoming Toyota Camry made an abrupt left turn and hit him, police said.</p>
<p>"He was launched right over the car," Toronto police Sgt. Tim Burrows said.</p>
<p>The man is expected to recover.</p>
<p>The driver of the Camry, a 24-year-old man, has been charged with careless driving.</p>
<p>Blood-covered man</p>
<p>dropped at hospital</p>
<p>A blood-covered man who appeared to have been slashed with a machete in the arm and back was dumped outside Scarborough General Hospital yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Two men dropped off the 26-year-old wounded man shortly before 3: 30 a.m., police said.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes earlier, officers were called to a fight at a bar on Eglinton Ave. E. near Danforth Rd., where they found blood splatters. Investigators won't say whether the incidents are related.</p>
<p>Police say the man's injuries are minor.</p>
<p>Manitoba</p>
<p>Hospitals to cancel surgeries if flu cases rise</p>
<p>The chief nursing officer for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority says city hospitals may have to cancel elective surgeries if more flu cases turn up in Manitoba this weekend.</p>
<p>Jan Currie says the authority is closely watching to see if more people get sick and need to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>There are 119 cases of confirmed swine flu in the province. About two dozen people with severe flu-like symptoms are being treated in intensive care. About two-thirds of those are aboriginal.</p>

<p>Guelph considers open-air urinals</p>
<p>Men ambling home late from the bars in Guelph may no longer be forced to duck behind a bush when they've really gotta go.</p>
<p>A city staff proposal to introduce open-air urinals this summer will be considered as a pilot project at a meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Open-air urinals, which are available in several styles, are rarely used in North America but used to be common in Europe.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer, the public bathroom would be installed late Thursday afternoons and removed Sunday mornings.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>State as mother; Critics say it's time to rein in child-welfare agencies</b>
</div><div>By   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>2360 words</div><div>13 June 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>(From the National Post, June 30, 2009) Marty McKay is a former clinical psychologist. Her credentials were misstated in the June 13 edition of the National Post. ***** </p>
<p>They are charged with the most essential of duties: protecting vulnerable children from abuse and neglect. They will intervene in the lives of roughly 200,000 Canadian children this year.</p>
<p>For most of us, they are generally unseen, save for occasional mentions in news reports, when they rescue children from misery. Or, as sometimes happens, deliver it.</p>
<p>Canada's child-welfare agencies, says University of Manitoba social work professor Brad McKenzie, have among the broadest intervention powers in the Western world.</p>
<p>Caseworkers come armed with vaster powers than any police officer investigating crime.</p>
<p>It is an immense authority easily abused, without vigilant restraint.</p>
<p>It is time, critics say, they were reined in.</p>
<p>"The social worker system, as it applies to children, is out of control, seriously out of control," says Katherine McNeil, a children's advocate who has worked with families in Nova Scotia and B. C. "And nobody's doing anything about it."</p>
<p>Child-welfare agencies step in when kids are homeless, exploited, hungry or abused. They do not stop there. As the highly publicized neo-Nazi case in Winnipeg demonstrates, they might seize children from parents for teaching racist views, or for "emotional neglect." They have taken newborns from parents considered insufficiently intelligent; from religious families believing the Bible commands them to discipline kids with a rod. They order homeschooling parents to enroll children in public school, deeming them inadequately socialized.</p>
<p>"They violate all kinds of privacy and rights," says Chris Klicka, senior counsel for the Home School Defense League, which represents Canadian and American parents.</p>
<p>Whether we wanted it or not, knew it or not, over time, the work of child-welfare organizations has become "parenting by the state and the imposition of their value system on other people," says Marty McKay, a clinical psychologist who has worked on abuse cases in the United States and Canada. Provincial agencies have the power to intervene when children are considered "at risk" of abuse or neglect -- even if none has actually occurred. Or, where spousal abuse happens, but kids are untouched. And what they do with the children they take can sometimes be worse than what they suffered at home.</p>
<p>When journalist J. J. Kelso founded Canada's first Children's Aid Society in 1891, it was from revulsion at what he had witnessed working in Toronto's slums: the filthy, homeless urchins begging on the street, the school-aged girls whored out by parents for whisky money; children needing "rescue," Kelso exhorted, "from the environments of vice, cruelty or mendicancy."</p>
<p>Courts could imprison parents for cruelty, but not revoke custody. Backed by the 1893 Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to and Better Protection of Children, the society had unique authority to directly interfere in affairs of parents and children: Anyone under 14 found begging, receiving alms, out late, homeless, orphaned, imprisoned, thieving, or associating with thieves, drunkards or vagrants, would be appropriated by the province.</p>
<p>Since then, as child-welfare agencies multiplied across Canada, their authority expanded, too.</p>
<p>One Calgary mother said her kids were recently pulled from class and questioned by a caseworker after she kept them home from school for a week, fearing they might be exposed to swine flu. When the mother protested, the worker threatened to seize all six children in her house, including two toddlers.</p>
<p>"All because I was overtly concerned about my children's health," says an incredulous Ms. K, who, as is the case with all investigations, cannot be identified. Nor can she ever know who lodged the complaint against her.</p>
<p>The worker later visited the house. There, Ms. K reports (and witnesses confirm), when she further protested the interference -- at one point calling police -- the agent hollered at her, physically accosted her, and threatened to report her for abuse, of which, the caseworker later relented, there was no evidence.</p>
<p>The secrecy that envelops these cases makes it nearly impossible to fully investigate Ms. K's remarkable claims: caseworkers do not permit "clients," as they're called, to record meetings, and agencies cannot comment on any case. But the account doesn't shock those who work closely with the authorities.</p>
<p>"I'm certainly not surprised, and hear over and over again of workers ... threatening [parents] with apprehension. They'll never admit it in court, of course, but I hear it all the time," says Bradley Spier, a Calgary family lawyer. "Most of the time they're above board.... They all have an attitude, but they'll do their investigation and, if they can't substantiate it, they're generally pretty honest about that, and won't take any action. But until then, they're god-like creatures, for lack of a better word. Or they think they are."</p>
<p>The government's role in protecting vulnerable children treads an impossibly fine line. Without anonymous complaints, and the power to interview and apprehend, some children would undoubtedly suffer terribly. Accordingly, legislators grant workers astounding licence: a social work graduate, fresh from college, can enter a home without warrant; apprehend children without due process; and commandeer police officers to enforce his or her efforts. A caseworker can order children dressed, fed, medicated and educated any way they consider appropriate. Parents who do not submit risk losing custody, even visitation of their kids. Or have them taken away permanently.</p>
<p>"I think child protection workers, in the system that they work in, do a very good job and they have the best of intentions," said Kendra Nixon, a social work professor at the University of Manitoba who worked for Child Welfare in Ontario. "But the reality is that it's underfunded. You're dealing with families that have complicated, complex, life situations....</p>
<p>"It's hard not to be personally invested, because the case is so real-- you're dealing with children, so people are going to be emotional about it."</p>
<p>And yet, it is an authority that is sometimes severely misused. When that happens, Ms. McKay says, families can be traumatized in a perversion of the very system designed to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>The anonymous process, for example, invites bogus tips -- commonly from divorcing parents, for instance, since agencies can unilaterally alter custody arrangements. Most complaints prove "unsubstantiated": 55% according to the most recent statistics from the Public Health Agency's Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect.</p>
<p>"Children's Aid, even when they don't start an investigation [themselves], they can be manipulated by people," Ms. McKay says.</p>
<p>Prof. McKenzie says childwelfare agencies typically do good work under difficult circumstances. Overstretched caseworkers, with general training, can be unequipped to specialize in interventions and the complexities each case brings. What some, middle-class agents might consider neglect, for example, is often a matter of poverty, not necessarily cruelty.</p>
<p>And some child-welfare workers also exploit their tremendous clout to behave unethically, prejudicially or illegally.</p>
<p>"Some of them get a real power complex because they have a bachelor of social work, or a master's, and they suddenly have this power [to] apprehend," Ms. McKay says. "They throw their weight around." She sees in some workers a "police mentality." It may be a coincidence, but in the largest English-speaking provinces, Alberta, B. C. and Ontario (Quebec data are incomplete), the number of children taken into care by provincial agencies between 1993 and 2001, rose a remarkable 97%, 63% and 72% respectively.</p>
<p>Prof. McKenzie is encouraged by a nascent trend in Canadian agencies away from historic, heavier-handed investigative and apprehension focus, and toward working more cooperatively with families to improve home conditions.</p>
<p>Studies show that under the current system, he says, "generally we find that the majority of children that are served [by welfare agencies] do well" -- meaning they thrive at school, seem generally well-adjusted, are free from abuse and neglect. About 15% to 20%, he says, do not.</p>
<p>That is not a trifling number. But the stories behind it -- let alone the validity of the initial apprehensions -- can prove impenetrable. Cases are shrouded in silence, media blocked from reporting details in the legitimate name of protecting children involved (even in the Winnipeg neo-Nazi case, most details were concealed). But such limits thwart public scrutiny of an arm of government as capable of error as any other, and working with some of the highest stakes imaginable.</p>
<p>Last year, Ontario MPP Andrea Horwath tabled a private member's bill to make Children's Aid Societies answerable to the provincial ombudsman, something Ontario's Children and Youth Services has repeatedly resisted (ombudsmen in some other provinces, such as Alberta, have that authority). Ontario's CAS typically refuses to share files with its Child Advocate; in his annual report released earlier this year -- which found 90 children in provincial care died in 2008 -- Irwin Elman called it "almost impossible" to get information necessary to investigate potential agency wrongdoing. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled parents could not sue childwelfare agencies; provinces, it ruled, owed no "duty of care" to families. The lack of oversight, says Ms. McNeil, creates departments accountable only to themselves.</p>
<p>And there are numerous instances of caseworkers acting improperly. Two years ago, a Nova Scotia judge ruled that workers intervening in a divorce custody dispute were so biased against the mother, and in favour of the father -- who lived with a woman previously the subject of interventions for violence and neglect -- that they took "intentional and deliberate" steps to "mislead the court" by concealing evidence against him. A few years earlier, the CAS of Prescott and Russell, near Ottawa, and one worker, were convicted of contempt of court for refusing to return a two-year-old boy to his parents, defying a judge's instructions to do so. Agents insisted they were acting in the boy's "best interests." In 2001, two judges in Simcoe, Ont., criticized the CAS there for "arbitrary use of government power" and unreasonableness "verging on blind obstinacy" in fighting to keep children from being adopted by certain foster parents. Several parents interviewed for this story claim to have faced false accusations and bullying from caseworkers harbouring apparent agendas.</p>
<p>A report this year from Saskatchewan's Children's Advocate, Marvin Bernstein, found children suffering serious, ongoing abuse and neglect in the care of the province amidst a "culture of non-compliance with policy" among social services staff.</p>
<p>Even when acting with utmost professionalism, whether agents are able to provide children a better, safer environment than where they came from is not certain.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernstein's report found staff knowingly placing children with histories of committing sexual abuse into crowded foster homes where they preyed on other kids, without alerting foster parents to the problem (one reported that a caseworker assured her "a certain amount of sexual abuse is to be expected in a foster home"). A quarter of children were placed in overcrowded homes, he found, as staff routinely used "manipulative methods" to "trick" foster parents into taking more kids than they were approved for. Two Saskatchewan caseworkers were suspended in February after being discovered shuffling children between foster homes to hide overcrowding conditions from investigators.</p>
<p>"Children's Aid has no business placing into care a child that they can foresee is going to come out worse the other end than when they went in," Ms. McKay says. "If that's the best they can do, just leave them."</p>
<p>Two teens charged in connection with a recent double murder near Edmonton were in care of a ministry-licensed group home -- a place neighbours say they warned the government for years was poorly monitored. In March, a 15-month-old baby in care of Alberta's Children and Youth Services suffered critical head injuries in a foster home; in the past four years, two Alberta children have been killed by foster parents. A 2008 report found Alberta caseworkers regularly placing kids in unsafe conditions, including abusive situations.</p>
<p>Last year, seven-year-old Katelynn Sampson was killed in Toronto in care of a foster parent with a record of violent crimes, and in Vancouver, police discovered minors in provincial care working as prostitutes. In 2002, Jeffrey Baldwin was abused and neglected to death by a couple with a known history of child abuse but were nonetheless granted custody of the five-year-old by the Catholic Children's Aid Society of Toronto. A 2006 CBC investigation uncovered Ontario caseworkers drugging a seven-year-old Ontario boy into a stupor with massive doses of psychotropic medications, which a psychiatrist would later find had "no actual treatment value," except making him more compliant in his group home. While in his drugged state, he was sexually abused by fellow residents.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the good intentions of child-welfare agencies argue they lack the resources to deal properly with each case; with some workers handling more than 30 clients simultaneously, it is impossible to act perfectly. One problem, believes Ms. McKay, is caseworkers spread too thin, drifting far from the original vision of the state's role in family matters: protecting kids from verifiable and authentic abuse, cruelty and neglect.</p>
<p>"They need to go back to the basics," she says. "Do the children look well-nourished? Do they have bruises on them? Are they molested? Is the house crawling with cockroaches? If not, they're not being abused or neglected."</p>
<p>But with powerful, generally unaccountable agencies, dependent on justifying their place in a world far improved from the cruelties of J. J. Kelso's Victorian Toronto, the need to intervene in more cases, for more reasons, may make such discipline difficult. "I would love to just demolish the system and start from scratch again," she says. "Because it's gone very far awry here."</p>

</div><div>By Bruce Owen   </div>
<div>444 words</div><div>13 June 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The number of confirmed H1N1 flu cases in Manitoba jumped by 42 Friday, bringing the total to 119 laboratory-confirmed cases, provincial health officials said.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of those cases are aboriginal with 17 coming from northern Manitoba, the hardest-hit area of the province in the flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"This isn't unexpected," acting chief provincial public health officer Dr. Elise Weiss said. "It confirms, basically, what we knew before, that the virus is present throughout the province.</p>
<p>"We certainly expect to see more cases. We don't know how long this is going to continue, but we're certainly prepared for it.</p>
<p>Jan Currie, vice-president and chief nursing officer for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said of the 119 cases, 31 patients are in hospital being treated for severe respiratory illness. No health care workers have become severely ill.</p>
<p>Currie also said officials will monitor the number of new cases over the weekend to determine if elective surgeries should be cancelled next week to free up resources.</p>
<p>She also said the current hospital system is satisfactorily handling the outbreak and the number of people being admitted. Two Winnipeg hospitals, the Health Sciences Centre and Seven Oaks General Hospital, will open as flu clinics should the number of people becoming sick increase sharply.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't be opening those clinics unless we had a need beyond our normal services or a need to hand out antivirals in large quantities," Currie said.</p>
<p>She added about 25 per cent of visits to Winnipeg emergency rooms are flu related, with only the most severely ill being tested for H1N1 so as to not put strain on resources.</p>
<p>The majority of people in Manitoba who become ill will not require hospitalization.</p>
<p>Health officials also said there is no public health reason at this point to close schools, community centres or other public gathering places or to avoid travel to any community. That includes communities like St. Theresa Point, which has been hit hard by the virus.</p>
<p>They also said wearing surgical masks does little good for the public.</p>
<p>"Mask use is really indicated for health care workers, if you're within two metres of an individual where there might be risk of coughing and sneezing and then breathing it in," Weiss said. "The same thing might go if you're caring for a family member at home. You may want to consider a mask in that instance.</p>
<p>"Otherwise, there's no public health reason for masks for the general public."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doctors call for flu aid to first nations; Canada 'can and should' send help</b>

<p>The global volunteer agency Doctors Without Borders says Canada can and should help its own first nations struggling with Third World conditions and he H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>"I believe in Canada we have the capacity to respond to that," said Dr. Joanne Liu, the outgoing president of Doctors Without Borders Canada.</p>
<p>Her comments come as health authorities say a 42-person jump in the number of Manitobans infected with the H1N1 flu virus further confirms the influenza outbreak is provincewide, and it's likely flu is present in every community in Manitoba.</p>
<p>On Friday, officials reported there were 119 cases of confirmed in Manitoba. Two-thirds of those cases are aboriginal, with 17 coming from northern Manitoba, the hardest-hit area of the province.</p>
<p>"This isn't unexpected," acting chief provincial public health officer Dr. Elise Weiss said. "It confirms, basically, what we knew before, that the virus is present throughout the province.</p>
<p>"We certainly expect to see more cases. We don't know how long this is going to continue, but we're certainly prepared for it."</p>
<p>But Liu says governments and agencies involved need to work together and make sure care is getting to the people in times of crisis, said Liu.</p>
<p>"Being a country of the G8 and with all the resources we have here, it would be unfortunate if we are not able to coordinate ourselves and respond to the crisis," Liu said Friday.</p>
<p>"We need to get our act together and do what is right for the First Nations people," said Liu. "That needs political leadership. It's a question of will."</p>
<p>As the H1N1 virus sweeps through the remote Manitoba native communities of Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point, about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, local officials point out Ottawa and Manitoba are unable to provide them with basic medical care, such as a full-time doctor and adequate hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>"It's very frustrating," said Liu.</p>
<p>"It is important that Manitobans and the Canadian public understand the obstacles and hurdles first nations are facing in accessing the basic health-care services that many others take for granted," said Ron Evans, grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 virus that is seriously impacting our communities today demonstrates that our communities and people continue to suffer in poor living conditions," Evans said.</p>
<p>For nearly three years, aboriginal leaders have tried to work with federal officials to develop pandemic planning, but nothing happened until the H1N1 virus hit the northern community of St. Theresa Point about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>"We are on the verge of a full-scale pandemic, and we are once again calling upon all levels of government, the minister of health, and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, for immediate action," Evans said.</p>
<p>"We have no time for jurisdictional battles. We must all work together on this."</p>
<p>And there are signs some help is mobilizing for the remote communities.</p>
<p>A call Thursday for extra medical coverage in St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill has been answered, an official said Friday. A physician is being sent next week.</p>
<p>On Friday, Manitoba Nurses Union president Sandi Mowat said some Winnipeg Regional Health Authority nurses will volunteer to work at some of the understaffed northern nursing stations to give their colleagues a break.</p>

<p>We have read a great deal recently about Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt's musings about how "sexy" the problems are at Chalk River and her negative views of her colleague, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>But while Raitt looks after her career prospects, Aglukkag goes about her job looking after the H1N1 issues. "We must resist speculation, rely on the science, and report only on confirmed cases" she was quoted yesterday as saying.</p>
<p>Perhaps the management of the Chalk River isotope facility should be the minister of health's responsibility rather than the natural resources minister's.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The spread of sickness</b>
</div><div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>Even if the swine flu only sickens rather than kills people, a Level 6 pandemic could still translate into severe economic dislocation.</p>
<p>In the City of Ottawa, the number of people who have tested positive for the disease is up close to 300 per cent -- in one week. And medical officer of health Isra Levy says the number of positive tests is just "the tip of the iceberg."</p>
<p>Serious medical officials are making serious statements about swine flu. Dr. David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer of Canada, said that this country, as one of the first three to be infected, has already been experiencing the pandemic for a few months. One gets the sense that the declaration of the global pandemic by the World Health Organization was but a formality. Here in Ottawa, the number of schools with confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus is now 50. This thing is spreading.</p>
<p>Health officials are absolutely right to avoid any talk that rings of panic. But it's important to communicate messages of concern and caution, because a lot of people are going to get sick.</p>
<p>The city's pandemic plan imagines a scenario in which as many as 35 per cent of Ottawans are ill at the same time, for a period of up to eight weeks. Any such pandemic would place strain even on those who are not ill, because they will be the ones taking care of friends and family who are.</p>
<p>Companies could be looking at absentee levels that will interfere with their operations, which is very bad news in an already trying economy. In such a situation, sick workers might be tempted to come to work anyway, but that would only create additional risks, jeopardizing the operation even more. This is something that employers would do well to start thinking about, sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Levy worries that we are becoming too complacent about swine flu, and he's right. This is not flu season; the weather is turning nice. Now that it appears H1N1, at least in its current incarnation, is not a 1918-level killer, we figure that the coast is clear.</p>
<p>The truth is that influenza, even an ordinary variety, is a killer disease for many elderly people and those who have other health problems. When swine flu first appeared earlier this year there was suddenly much attention drawn to the value of hand-washing, coughing into sleeves and other basic techniques that reduce its spread. These practices should be kept up. They aren't on par with great vaccines or wonder drugs, but they work.</p>
<p>"The more our residents and businesses prepare as a community," says John Ash, the manager of the city's integrated public safety unit, "the better our city can remain resilient to lessen the impact of an influenza spread."</p>
<p>That's advice worth listening to.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Aboriginal communities hit by H1N1 flu short on supplies, chief insists</b>
</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>The Manitoba government tried to reassure aboriginal communities hard-hit by H1N1 flu that they are getting proper supplies, but a chief in the area rejected the idea.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Health Minister Theresa Oswald toured St. Theresa Point, the epicentre of an outbreak that has caused more than two dozen people to be airlifted to Winnipeg, and declared the community well-stocked.</p>
<p>"I saw supplies on the ground with my own eyes -- masks, protective materials,'' Oswald told reporters on her return to Winnipeg.</p>
<p>"(Residents) are OK right now, but they're wanting to receive more supplies like hand sanitizer, in particular for homes that don't have running water.''</p>
<p>But Chief David Harper of the nearby Garden Hill First Nation said his community is short of pretty much every medical supply, especially masks.</p>
<p>"The nursing station had a box of 20 and that was gone right away. That was the only one that we had,'' Harper said.</p>
<p>The flu's effects on St. Theresa Point, Garden Hill and other communities in the sparsely populated northeast section of Manitoba has caught the attention of the World Health Organization, which is concerned that many residents have suffered severe symptoms and have ended up in intensive care.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, there were 31 Manitobans in hospital on ventilators due to the H1N1 flu. Two-thirds are aboriginal, health officials said. Many are from the Burntwood region, a sprawling northern area with only 10,000 residents and no hospital.</p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders have cancelled public events, closed schools, and have been trying to hand out masks to community residents.</p>

</p>
<p>It happens occasionally that you catch a glimpse of your face in a mirror and are momentarily unfamiliar with yourself. In that fraction of a second before recognition sinks in you might mutter internally, "My, what an odd-looking person."</p>
<p>I had such a moment a few days ago in a warped mirror in a campground restroom somewhere around the border between Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It was about 6 a.m. and I had just woke from a brief, terrible sleep in the front seat of my car. I was on the first leg of my trip back across the country from the Prairies. I was not myself.</p>
<p>There in the glass was a gaunt, deeply tanned face with a battered bottom lip, heavy eyes inhabited by an expression of grave illness, and a mug covered with five days' worth of mostly silver beard. "Who the hell are you, buddy, and what have you done with the real me?"</p>
<p>I was in quite a state after spending five days cycling in Saskatchewan's Qu'Appelle Valley. I had picked up something that made me forfeit control of my bodily functions -- a swamp parasite, a tick-borne bacteria or a hint of the swine flu. I had lost roughly 12 pounds, and was forced to keep a minute-by-minute vigil over the alarming thunderstorm that churned in my stomach. The gut rumblings continued for roughly 2,500 kilometres.</p>
<p>In planning my idyllic bike tour of the Great Plains valley there were a couple of crucial variables I overlooked. First, could my nearly 50-year-old body actually handle pedalling a bike for nine or more hours a day, especially without training? And, secondly, the wind. The cursed prairie wind! I had forgotten all about it.</p>
<p>Somehow my idealistic expectations about the spiritual self-discovery element of the journey overshadowed the practical, realistic side. That's just life, I guess. Fantasy so often overrides reality.</p>
<p>Cycling 350 kilometres in five days, weighed down with four packed panniers, a tent and sleeping gear over a rolling landscape, under a constant, draining sun, was the most physically demanding experience of my life. My thighs got torn up, my wrists grew numb. My backside became an ungodly sore spot screaming for rest and pain relief. Add the wind -- the cursed wind -- to the equation and I was losing fluids, burning fat and dropping weight at the rate of a liposuction clinic.</p>
<p>On the second morning of my trek, after I had spent the night behind the chapel of a vacant summer camp, I dipped my water bottles in a small valley lake and drank them down. I was so thirsty. Later, I learned there were boil- water advisories throughout the region.</p>
<p>Also, not convinced ticks would be present that early in the year, I initially sat carefree in the grasses along the roadside. I was alarmed by the number of the diabolical blood suckers that found their way down my socks and dined on my ankles.</p>
<p>I had hoped to log 100 kilometres each day on my adventure, but the wind kept me down to roughly 70 kilometres. Those gruelling kilometres took me through an awe-inspiring landscape and many dying rural towns, where I met some of the most curious, courteous and friendly people I have ever met, and where I breathed some of the purest air in the country.</p>
<p>Once my physical recuperation is complete, I suspect the spiritual dimension of the trip will emerge. And even if there are no immediate revelations, I take consolation in the fact I now have the strongest pair of legs I've had in a long time.</p>

</p>
<p>LONDON -- Once there was a boy growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico, whose appetite for horror novels and comics was nearly insatiable. Vampiric, even. One day this boy had a job cleaning a swimming pool, but he also had his hands on the unholy grail – a novel by one of his favourite writers, Stephen King.</p>
<p>At 9 a.m., when he was supposed to be checking filters and skimming bugs, he stretched out on a deck chair instead, thinking he'd just read a bit of the novel, maybe a chapter, because it had such an intriguing title: Salem's Lot.</p>
<p>Twelve hours later, the small town of Jerusalem's Lot, Maine, had been laid waste by vampires, and the boy, Guillermo del Toro, was still clutching the novel in his deck chair, sunburned, with two pale reverse raccoon shadows across his eyes where his sunglasses sat.</p>
<p>So if Guillermo del Toro scares the bathing suits off readers this summer with his own horror novel, The Strain, they can send their thanks – or legal writs – to Stephen King. Or any one of a hundred masters of the macabre who feed the boy's appetite for “summer books” – those gripping, gory stories that you read in a sitting, forgetting to eat or move until you realize the room has gone eerily dark, and you jump up to turn on the lights.</p>
<p>“When that happens with a book, it's so joyful,” says del Toro, over the phone during a cyclone promotional tour of England. “You want to be entranced like that.”</p>
<p>Until now, del Toro has been famous for projecting his dark preoccupations on to cinema screens, as the director of Hellboy, Mimic and 2006's Oscar-winning Pan's Labyrinth. Now he's taken a lifelong obsession with the vampire, evident from his directorial debut, 1993's Cronos, and turned it into The Strain (the first in a trilogy, co-authored by thriller writer Chuck Hogan.) It may be his first novel, but it's been percolating for three-quarters of his life, as he collected vampire lore from around the world, and created, in his head, a complex system of vampire biology and sociology. It's not pretty. Think Rabid (David Cronenberg's 1977 take on vampirism, a huge influence on del Toro) rather than Twilight.</p>
<p>In fact, it's best not to mention Twilight; it's like waving a crucifix.</p>
<p>The just-released novel's opening deliberately evokes the ship-borne evil in Bram Stoker's Dracula: A 777 jet sits on a runway at JFK Airport, its lights out, an inexplicable sense of dread escaping its sealed doors. Everybody on board is dead, and epidemiologist Ephraim Goodweather is dispatched to uncover the cause. Think there's something waiting for him? Something that travelled in a huge ebony box filled with dirt?</p>
<p>These are not paperback-variety vampires. For one thing, the main metaphor is contemporary; the monsters' sickness is virally transmitted. It's a thoroughly modern malaise.</p>
<p>“We have enthroned the concept of a pandemic in the same sense that primitive man would have enthroned the idea of an evil spirit – we've made it into a bogeyman,” says del Toro. “Except we sound a little more civilized by invoking science. But the panicked, irrational way people react to it is pretty superstitious.”</p>
<p>He's been thinking about it even more lately with the threat of swine flu, the H1N1 virus which originated in Mexico and on Thursday was formally declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. To make it even more of-the-moment, there's a not entirely subtle critique of capitalism in that the betrayer of humankind is one of the world's richest men.</p>
<p>Del Toro's diabolical chuckle suggests that this was deliberate. “I tried to press the point that some of the most horrible acts are not necessarily by the vampires,” he says. “Lack of choice kind of exonerates you. When a creature is hard wired to be a certain way, it's ingrown in the DNA, but when a person chooses to proceed with ethnic extermination or enforcing his own greed – those are conscious choices.”</p>
<p>Ask about his other influences and he responds in flawless, exuberant and somewhat baroque English: He and Hogan were striving for a certain noir sensibility and a thriller's pace, and to achieve those ends they were not afraid to use “the purple prose of Cairo.” From the vampire lore he's collected all his life, he appropriated the Polish idea that the creatures don't have fangs, but instead fleshy, tentacle-like stingers; from Mexican mythology, he took the idea that vampires are hairless and hot-blooded, “like Chihuahuas.”</p>
<p>Also from Mexico, and Catholicism, too many influences to count: “Have you ever been to an open-casket wake?” he asks, with a nearly audible shudder. “Man, if you have the misfortune to look in, you see the person's not there any more. You just see what used to contain that person.”</p>
<p>If lust and horror are the twin fuels of the vampire genre, it's clear which one del Toro finds more combustible. He and Hogan go so far as to render the vampires neuter, in a chilling fashion. (Let's put it this way: del Toro pronounces the obscure but anatomically precise word “cloaca” with great relish.) There are no moony glances in The Strain, no preternaturally smooth skin, no undying puppy love.</p>
<p>“I detest the fact that some vampire fiction has continued to perpetuate this shrine to eternal youth and beauty, which I find truly castrating as an aging, fat, ugly man,” he says, and it's pretty obvious he's got the Twilight franchise in his sights.</p>
<p>“It used to be quite iconoclastic to enthrone the vampire as an anti-hero; it had value. I really enjoyed Anne Rice's first novels. But now that there's pre-packaged rebellion in every store that you can order or download, I find it less interesting.”</p>
<p>If Salem's Lot was the main literary influence, the cinematic equivalent was Rabid, in which a ravenous Marilyn Chambers gives new meaning to “the pits” (Chambers' character develops an unusually hungry organ in her armpit).</p>
<p>“I love Cronenberg,” del Toro says. “All of his early Canadian shock movies were fantastic.” Not surprisingly, he originally envisaged The Strain as a multi-part TV series along the lines, believe it or not, of The Wire. He wrote a treatment and went into the headquarters of Fox to pitch it to their TV executives. “And they said, ‘We love vampires. Could you put them in a comedy?' So I asked them to validate my parking. As I grow older, I get less patient with people dabbling with my stuff.”</p>
<p>He's got a lot of his own stuff to play with right now: There are the next two novels, to be released next year and in 2011, and he's overseeing a competition to create a cinematic trailer to accompany the first novel – the winning directors will see their trailers in cinemas across the land.</p>
<p>Then there's the small – about hip-high – matter of The Hobbit, a Lord of the Rings prequel that he's directing, which he calls a “very beautiful experience; I'm having the time of my life. There are plenty of monsters to keep me happy.”</p>
<p>Del Toro has always been interested in the stout-hearted innocent at the centre of a dark tale, and in some ways the journey of Bilbo Baggins is similar to the one taken by 11-year-old Zack Goodweather in The Strain.</p>
<p>“I love Zack,” says del Toro. “I'm afraid we take him to some very dark places in the next book.” He laughs again at the thought of inflicting torment on his young hero.</p>
<p>Does he realize how diabolical that laugh is? “I know,” he says. “I have no other kinds.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Horror's pedigree</p>
<p>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE STRAIN</p>
<p>• Guillermo Del Toro borrowed from Polish lore the image of vampires with fleshy stingers rather than fangs. In line with Mexican mythology, his vampires are hairless and hot-blooded.</p>
<p>• In David Cronenberg's 1977 film Rabid, an injured woman has some of her tissue grafted to damaged parts of her body, and it morphs into an orifice under her armpit that hides a stinger used to feed on the blood of others. Her victims then transform into rabid zombies, whose bite spreads the disease.</p>
<p>Del Toro's films</p>
<p>Cronos (1993)</p>
<p>A mechanical device found by an antique dealer, shaped like a scarab, looks harmless enough, but when wound up, it grabs a hold of him with spider-like legs and injects him with an unidentified solution. What he doesn't know is that the solution is designed to convey eternal life to its owner, as well as a vampire's thirst for blood. When a businessman who knows of the device's existence seeks it out, the fight is on.</p>
<p>Mimic (1997)</p>
<p>Del Toro says studio meddling ruined his film about cockroach-killing insects, designed to die after one generation, that outsmart the scientists and are still alive three years later. Oh yes, and they can also mimic the human form. Look out, Manhattan.</p>
<p>The Devil's Backbone (2001)</p>
<p>A boy stuck in an orphanage faces ghostly disturbances. Set during the Spanish Civil War, Del Toro has called this film his most personal project.Blade II (2002)</p>
<p>Marvel comic books first introduced the character of Blade, and the first film in this series was directed by Stephen Norrington. In the sequel, the vampire hunter, played by Wesley Snipes, joins forces with his enemies to battle a deadly foe. Hellboy (2004)</p>
<p>Another comic book character, this one courtesy of Mike Mignola. A red-skinned, horned demon rescued from the Nazis during the Second World War joins sides with a top-secret government organization to fight evil.</p>
<p>Pan's Labyrinth (2006)</p>
<p>Del Toro blends fantasy with the horrors of war in the story of a young girl who goes to live with her stepfather, a captain in 1944 fascist Spain. There, she is put on a quest by a faun that puts her in the path of some mighty strange creatures.Hellboy II: The Golden Army(2008)</p>
<p>Hellboy returns to battle a ruthless leader who has awakened an army of creatures capable of destroying the human race.</p>
<p>The Hobbit</p>
<p>and The Hobbit 2 (2012)</p>
<p>Del Toro plans to direct these two films back to back. The first picks up the story of Bilbo Baggins as he journeys to the Lonely Mountain with a group of dwarves to reclaim a treasure. Staff</p>

<p>FRESH off the plane from St. Theresa Point First Nation, Health Minister Theresa Oswald said two doctors and two nurses have responded to her urgent call for medical help in Manitoba's northern communities.</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point, located 500 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, has at least nine confirmed cases of H1N1, while dozens of other residents have been flown to Winnipeg for treatment after reporting severe flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Oswald pleaded for more doctors and nurses to serve in northern First Nations communities as the virus continues to spread. Neighbouring Garden Hill First Nation has also been afflicted with two confirmed cases of swine flu, including an 18-month-old boy.</p>
<p>"Right now, we have an additional four personnel that have committed -- two doctors and two nurse practitioners -- which is excellent, but that's not yet enough," Oswald said, adding she believes more health professionals will step forward as her call to action reaches more people.</p>
<p>"I am going to say right now that there will be no number (of doctors and nurses) that I will consider enough, so I want more to come forward and arrange for today, for tomorrow and well into late August."</p>
<p>It has yet to be determined where the four recruits will be sent, but Oswald said the decision would be made soon so they can begin their work swiftly.</p>
<p>The visit to St. Theresa Point allowed provincial health officials to speak directly with the community's leadership and residents, and answer their questions.</p>
<p>Oswald was accompanied by Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer and Dr. Catherine Cook, who specializes in aboriginal health with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>Oswald spoke positively about her interactions with both the federal nurses who run the local nursing station, and the Northern Medical Unit doctor who is currently stationed in St. Theresa Point.</p>
<p>"The medical personnel there are second to none, they're working very hard and they're keeping people calm. It is not a situation of chaos -- it's a situation of control, of calm, and of care," she said.</p>
<p>The trip also allowed Oswald to see first-hand what supplies are available in St. Theresa Point, and she said the community appears to have enough surgical masks and other material to meet their needs at this time.</p>
<p>Oswald -- who said she did not wear a mask during her visit -- and Kettner stressed there is no risk in travelling to St. Theresa Point.</p>
<p>"It's not dangerous and everyday business should continue," said Kettner.</p>
<p>"Judges can hold court in the north, and transport drivers can drive up with the needed food and supplies, and doctors and nurses can safely work in those communities."</p>

</p>
<p>LONDON -- With H1N1 influenza now an official pandemic, the race is on among drugmakers to produce a vaccine.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said Thursday after the World Health Organization declared a global flu epidemic it would be ready within weeks to begin large-scale vaccine production. <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span> also said it had started working on its own version. On Friday, Swiss pharma giant <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> announced it had created an experimental vaccine that has not been tested in people. <span class="companylink">Novartis</span>' vaccine was made via a cell-based technology that may prove faster than the traditional way of making vaccines, which relies on chicken eggs.</p>
<p>Many rich countries like Britain, Canada and France signed contracts with pharmaceuticals long ago, guaranteeing them access to pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>WHO and others estimate about 2.4 billion doses of pandemic vaccine could be available in about a year.</p>
<p>The likely scramble for vaccines will leave many people in poorer countries empty-handed.</p>
<p>So far, H1N1, also known as swine flu, has been mostly detected in developed countries like the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>"We do not know how this virus will behave under conditions typically found in the developing world," WHO chief Dr. Margaret Chan said Thursday.</p>
<p>WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said officials were concerned people in poorer countries and those fighting other health problems like malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition and pneumonia might be more susceptible to swine flu.</p>

</div><div>Editorial June 13   </div>

<p>Assurances from Canada's chief of public health that there is no good evidence that aboriginal people are at elevated risk from H1N1 flu might surprise those living on reserves in Manitoba. They have elevated risks from epidemics because they suffer disease at higher rates than non-aboriginals, they live in crowded, substandard housing conditions and are served inadequately with health services. Nursing stations are not hospitals.</p>
<p>Those nursing stations have been shown inadequate to the job that is thrust upon them now, with the spread of swine flu on some of Manitoba's northern isolated First Nations communities. But the problem the federal government is having recruiting sufficient numbers of nurses for the stations is a chronic, well-known issues. This epidemic -- now considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization -- only highlights the gravity of the issue and the danger to residents who are at elevated risk of getting hard hit by illnesses that hit the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones is right in one respect: It will take time to figure out whether the flu's spread in the Island Lakes region was unusual -- that more people contracted the flu itself -- or whether the impact of the virus hit that population harder than other populations. So far, swine flu in Canada has proven to be a virus similar to those that circulate during seasonal flu outbreaks -- striking a wide population but making only a limited percentage ill to the point of requiring hospitalization.</p>
<p>But general observations in Manitoba are reinforcing the experience with respiratory diseases that prey upon those most vulnerable: Of the 24 people in intensive care at Manitoba hospitals, two-thirds are aboriginal. The impact on the Island Lakes region has been considerably harder, and especially so because the people there who got sick could not stay in their home community, but were airlifted out to a Winnipeg hospital.</p>
<p>Most reserves are not well-served with adequately equipped health facilities. Nursing stations are staffed typically by nurses, many on longer contracts, who possess higher skills for the primary care required. But they work with limited equipment, usually low technology and are augmented by doctors who fly in for a short-term. A flu spreading through an isolated native community can wreak havoc on a population with high rates of asthma, tuberculosis, diabetes or other conditions compound an illness that hits the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>Responding to daily and epidemic health issues requires good, modern health care facilities. But the typical fall back for small northern reserves has been to airlift patients out to city hospitals. In southern Manitoba, a community of 10,000 is likely to have a well-equipped hospital. Island Lakes, comprised of four reserves, has a population of 10,000 but copes with nursing stations.</p>
<p>The pressures on the nurses -- many of whom leave their homes and families for months at a time -- and the struggle to recruit them would be alleviated with improved working conditions that accompany a well-equipped and staffed hospital.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq is proud of the country's plans for pandemic, but the swine flu has revealed a hole in how the country has met the challenge of H1N1. Using nursing stations to meet the daily or emergency needs of a community of the size of Island Lakes is getting by on the cheap. It is insufficient to the demands. Ms. Aglukkaq should make hospital construction a priority for sizable First Nations communities.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Judge slams criminalization of HIV; Canada giving wrong message by using courts in battle against AIDS, says South African leader</b>
</div><div>Tracey Tyler   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>634 words</div><div>13 June 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada's relentless practice of invoking the criminal law against people with HIV and AIDS is only intensifying the stigma surrounding the conditions and contravenes United Nations guidelines, argues a judge of South Africa's Constitutional Court, who is HIV-positive himself.</p>
<p>African countries that look to Canada as a world leader on human rights issues are getting the wrong message when it puts people with HIV/AIDS on trial for having unprotected sex, even when the virus has not been transmitted, Justice Edwin Cameron said yesterday.</p>
<p>"Canada's wide approach to exposure offences is sending out a terribly retrograde message to other countries, especially on my own continent, in Africa," said Cameron, who delivered the keynote speech last night to kick off a weekend symposium on HIV and human rights issues, hosted by the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network.</p>
<p>With human immunodeficiency virus still steeped in so much stigma in Africa that many are afraid to be tested, Canada is not providing a good example of dealing rationally and justly with the epidemic, said Cameron, noting Canada is a "world leader" in targeting HIV-positive people for prosecution.</p>
<p>The UN recommends those with HIV/AIDS be charged with exposing people to the virus through unprotected sex only in cases where they intended to transmit the virus and transmission actually occurred. Many other countries, including England, have developed similar guidelines.</p>
<p>But Canada's unusually aggressive approach goes "way, way" beyond those limits and has earned it the "dark distinction" of having prosecuted, per capita, more people with HIV than any other country, Cameron said in an interview.</p>
<p>Since the late 1980s, more than 90 people with HIV have been charged and almost 70 convicted of transmitting or exposing others to the disease.</p>
<p>Among them is a case now before the Manitoba Court of Appeal involving a man convicted of aggravated sexual assault for instances in which none of his partners was infected.</p>
<p>AIDS activists, Cameron said, must accept there may be instances in which criminal liability is justified, noting that one example might be the recent case in Hamilton of Johnson Aziga, convicted of first-degree murder for actively deceiving women about his HIV status and infecting them.</p>
<p>But Canada needs to rethink its sweeping use of the criminal law and question why it is singling out HIV-positive people for prosecution when the same Criminal Code powers are not being used against those who expose people to other potentially deadly conditions, he said.</p>
<p>"Let's take, for example, the two recent health scares, swine flu and the highly, highly contagious forms of tuberculosis. We had a case where somebody got onto an aircraft with a highly transmissible form of tuberculosis, and no one ever suggested that person should be prosecuted."</p>
<p>Cameron, 56, who was appointed to the court in January, acknowledged it is highly unusual for a sitting judge to speak out on social issues, particularly when they raise legal questions that might come before his court. But he does so under special circumstances, he said.</p>
<p>"I feel a sort of intensity about these issues because of the path I have walked. I have been close to death from AIDS. I've had my life given back to me. And I'm still the only person holding public office in the whole of Africa - the whole of Africa - who has spoken out about living with HIV."</p>
<p>"So I am speaking from an epidemic of silence."</p>

</p>
<p>Some things, nobody wants to hear.</p>
<p>Things like the new chair of <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., proudly declaring, "I don't know anything about cars." Whitacre does, at least, know something about business. He helped transform <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> from a dinosaur phone company into a diversified telecommunications powerhouse. Even so, at the age of 67, you'd think he'd know at least a little about cars. How can a man live for 67 years in the United States of America and know nothing about cars? That's like a Canadian who knows nothing about hockey. You have to wonder if there's something wrong with him.</p>
<p>Granted, there probably are Canadians who know nothing about hockey, but none of them is running a team.</p>
<p>If Whitacre can turn around GM, he's guaranteed a place of honour in the Executive Hall of Fame. If he fails, people will shake their heads and say, "He didn't know anything about cars."</p>
<p>ANOTHER THING nobody wants to hear is more pandemic alarms over the flu previously known as the swine flu.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization this week breathlessly declared a Level 6 alert, the highest alert level there is. Had the WHO been around in 1918 when the Spanish Influenza killed tens of millions around the world, including disproportionate numbers of the young and healthy, that, too, would have been a Level 6 alert. If the WHO had been around when the Black Death wiped out one-fifth of the world's population, that would have been a Level 6 alert.</p>
<p>But this flu that's going around now, this flu that has the WHO whipped into a lather, is nothing like the Black Death or the Spanish Influenza. This flu is no worse than the seasonal flu that comes around every winter. In other words, who cares?</p>
<p>We're told by the WHO, over the din of alarm bells, that pandemic alert levels are a measure, not of virulence, but of geography. A Level 6 alert means the outbreak is worldwide, not that the symptoms are especially severe. By that logic, the WHO should declare a Level 6 alert for athlete's foot, which also is worldwide and not that severe.</p>
<p>When this flu pandemic has passed -- if anyone notices, that is -- maybe the WHO could come up with a new alert system that actually is relevant to people.</p>
<p>HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE we don't want to hear:</p>
<p>"The mint has lost track of precious metal."</p>
<p>This from Rob Merrifield, federal minister responsible for the <span class="companylink">Royal Canadian Mint</span>, among other things.</p>
<p>Merrifield this week confirmed that an estimated $20-million worth of the mint's gold and silver is unaccounted for. The RCMP has been called in to investigate, but mint officials still are hoping the discrepancy is the result of a clerical error. The kind of clerical error that someone might make just before he suddenly packs up and moves to the Cayman Islands, I should think.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can narrow it down even further. Authorities won't specify what precious metals are missing, but if it's gold, $20-million worth would weigh a little more than half a ton. This would suggests a culprit who is either very strong or who knows how to operate a forklift.</p>
<p>It's possible, of course, that the loot was removed in smaller increments. Given a year between audits, with holidays and weekends factored in, the culprit had 240 working days, maximum, to pull off the heist. He only had to smuggle out about five pounds of gold each day. In that case, I'd look for someone who wears pleated trousers.</p>
<p>FINALLY, HERE is this week's winner in the Things We Don't Want to Hear Challenge. It comes from the picket line outside <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>'s Saskatoon distribution centre, where striking employees are urging consumers to drink to Pepsi.</p>
<p>"Have a Pepsi summer," declared union staff representative Rocky Luchsinger. A strike sometimes is unavoidable, but for striking employees to promote the competition is unwise and then some. If they were granted their wish for Pepsi to capture Coke's market share, they'd go straight from the picket line to the unemployment line. That's not exactly the optimal result for a strike supposedly over job security.</p>

</p>
<p>Quebec education department officials have not changed their approach to the management of swine flu cases by schools across the province, spokesperson Pierre Noël said after yesterday's upgrade of the illness to global pandemic status.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to follow developments closely," Noël added.</p>
<p>"If there are any measures to be taken, the school network will be notified in the quickest possible time."</p>
<p>However, he specified, education officials have opted for a status quo approach "for the time being."</p>
<p>The English Montreal School Board, among others, issued a similar stay-the-course message.</p>
<p>Spokesperson Mike Cohen did add that the board is being "extra vigilant" in ensuring that a June 1 directive from director-general Antonio Lacroce - on management of the illness and its consequences - continues to be applied.</p>
<p>There is no change in policy, Cohen specified, regardless of yesterday's fresh declaration by the World Health Organization that the first flu pandemic of the 21st century has begun.</p>
<p>"Any student who develops flu symptoms" - fever and cough, along with headache, extreme fatigue and muscle pain - should "remain at home until symptoms cease," the policy notes. Students who show up in class with "flu-like symptoms ... will be sent home."</p>
<p>"Regional directors are communicating directly with the principals (of individual schools) just to make sure that they're following up," Cohen said.</p>
<p>"They want to keep tabs, so to speak - if there are students absent, to follow up on why they're absent and if there have been specific problems, that they don't come back sick" with the flu in communicable form.</p>
<p>The board's policy was revised June 1 to reflect a significant change in public-health policy:</p>
<p>"Only individuals who have been hospitalized or admitted to emergency (rooms) for at least 24 hours due to flu symptoms ... will be subject to an investigation by public health authorities."</p>
<p>Along with this, specific schools are no longer being linked or identified with confirmed cases since the start of this month.</p>
<p>The same approach is common to other boards.</p>
<p>"Our policy remains the same and we have no further instructions" from the Education Department or public-health authorities, said Daniela Scoppa at the Lester B. Pearson School Board.</p>
<p>Added Alain Perron, speaking for the Commission scolaire de Montréal: "We continue to follow the directives and procedures issued by public health authorities."</p>
<p>Information: Info-Santé - dial 811 - can answer health-related questions and advise on proper procedures.</p>
