<p>With an anticipated second wave of H1N1 looming, some experts warn swine flu could leave a bigger psychological footprint than a medical one.</p>
<p>Humans by nature tend to be more afraid of what they don't know than what they do know, and when the threat is something people can't see, smell, hear or taste, and when anyone can be a carrier, it's a "game changer," says Steven Crimando, a crisis-management consultant, who has worked with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United Nations.</p>
<p>Crimando says the most common response in an emergency -- one pandemic readiness plans bank on -- is a "neighbour-helping-neighbour" response.</p>
<p>But if people believe others are in some way a threat to them, "all bets are off."</p>
<p>"You count on community cohesion in all sorts of crises and emergencies," said Crimando.</p>
<p>"When you have something that's invisible, when you have something that's contagious, it raises a different sort of fear -- a fear that very often divides people instead of bringing them together."</p>
<p>His comments follow a steady drumbeat of warnings from public health officials last week about an imminent, and possibly more serious, second wave of swine flu.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer says there could be four times as many hospitalizations in the next wave of H1N1 and that intensive care units across the country could quickly reach capacity with an increase in severe cases.</p>
<p>Doctors are warning of a shortage of critical medical equipment, including special ventilators needed to keep those with severe lung injury alive.</p>
<p>Crimando believes stigma could become an issue in the coming weeks, should H1N1 take off in greater numbers.</p>
<p>"You have a child who maybe mom or dad works in a hospital or health-care setting. The other parents perceive that that kid coming to school may be a greater risk to their own son or daughter because of their exposure at home. We saw that during the SARS outbreak."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sask. flu worries few; Many unconcerned about possible H1N1 outbreak, poll says</b>
</div><div>Anne Kyle </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>841 words</div><div>8 September 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>

<p>Saskatchewan residents are not overly worried about becoming ill with the H1N1 virus, according to a Sigma Analytics polls conducted on behalf of the Regina Leader-Post, but that could change.</p>
<p>Nearly one-half of those surveyed (46.3 per cent) said they were unconcerned about becoming ill with H1N1, while almost 30 per cent didn't voice a strong opinion either way. Concern is higher among women, First Nations and those with less than a Grade 12 education, according to the survey.</p>
<p>"I am not surprised the public isn't worried yet, but as soon as they start getting some symptoms and more and more people get (H1N1), they are going to want answers," said NDP health critic Judy Junor.</p>
<p>"I think we should be ahead of that curve and have the answers ready so we can assure the public that 'Yes, we are ready. We are right on top of this.' "</p>
<p>Health officials are warning residents that even though most cases to date have been mild to moderate, people should take an active role in protecting their health by practising good infection prevention measures.</p>
<p>While three out of four people were confident they would be able to get vaccinated in a timely way, only 59 per cent said they would likely roll up their sleeve and get an H1N1 shot, according to the survey.</p>
<p>Just under one in five (18.1 per cent) in the remaining 41 per cent who expressed reservations and uncertainty about getting immunized said it was highly unlikely they would get the shot.</p>
<p>The greatest number of people expressing concerns about possible side-effects were found in Moose Jaw and the southeast region of the province.</p>
<p>"It occurred to me that if a sufficient proportion of the population choose not to get vaccinated, the impact of a pandemic, if it happens, could be amplified," said Cam Cooper of Sigma Analytics.</p>
<p>"It is up to everybody to make their own call, but when you do a vaccination presumably you want it to be as close to universal as possible so that it has the maximum impact in limiting the downsides for everybody."</p>
<p>Last week the Ministry of Health announced it was ordering 1.5 million doses of H1N1 vaccine -- enough to serve the province based on the assumptions that recipients will need two shots and the uptake will only be about 45 per cent of the population, based on annual seasonal flu shot participation.</p>
<p>Junor questions whether there is enough vaccine to provide universal coverage. "I think . . . if the outbreak occurs and starts hitting people, and then the worry level will increase and you'll see more people wanting the vaccine," she said.</p>
<p>While the survey results indicate the ministry has done a good job informing the public about a possible H1N1 pandemic and the majority of those surveyed are satisfied with its pandemc planning, Junor begs to differ.</p>
<p>"Those awareness numbers are super strong. They are pushing universal," Cooper said, noting more than 80 per cent of those surveyed knew about pandemics and the planning that is underway for an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>Forty-seven per cent of those surveyed said they were satisfied with the government's pandemic planning; however, four out of 10 don't have a definitive opinion.</p>
<p>That 40 per cent number probably reflects the degree to which people aren't aware of what preparations are being made in the event of an H1N1 pandemic this fall, Cooper said.</p>
<p>"I think until the thing sort of comes over the horizon and looks imminent, there probably isn't too much more you can do in terms of talking about the possibility of it," he said, noting the first wave was mild but health officials are anticipating a more virulent second wave this fall.</p>
<p>"My guess would be that you might do better once the thing rears its head -- that might be the right time to pull the trigger on more publicity. It looks like the thing is widely known. On the whole, people are comfortable with the preparation, so really what you need to do is be ready to put the preparation into gear when the thing does come on, if it does," he said.</p>
<p>However, Junor, who conducted her own informal survey this summer, said she isn't convinced the province is doing a good job, particulary when it comes to communicating its pandemic preparation plans to front-line workers.</p>
<p>Sigma Analytics is a Saskatchewan firm providing data mining and modeling, attitudinal polling and market research.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted with 611 adults, over the age 18, between Aug. 27 and Sept. 1. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.96 per cent, 19 times out of 20. The sample was drawn provincewide and stratified by 10 regions so that response in each region met a quota determined by that region's share of the province's population.</p>

<p>It's been almost 300 years since Jonathan Swift proposed that the Irish, um, "utilize" their children to save themselves from famine. His writings were satire, but the notion comes to mind when considering the implications of a recent study on how to contain an H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Would we risk the health of our children if it could save us from a pandemic? That question could become our modern modest proposal.</p>
<p>In a recent issue of Science, researchers from Yale and Clemson universities state the best way to contain a flu pandemic is to vaccinate schoolchildren and their parents. As we know, schools are a bacteria-laden microcosm of society; a closed-in space with hundreds of kids breathing the same air.</p>
<p>Since schools serve as ground zero for an outbreak, mathematical models suggest that a flu pandemic could be contained at the lowest possible level by vaccinating only those associated with schools (children, their parents). Vaccinating health-care workers would have an added benefit, but stopping the transmission of the virus in schools would be sufficient to protect the entire population.</p>
<p>Adopting this approach would greatly minimize the number of individuals who need to be vaccinated. In addition, pregnant women, the elderly and the ill -- those considered most at risk of complications from H1N1 -- would be spared the added risks associated with the new H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The idea of focusing the vaccine on those most likely to transmit the virus makes sense (especially if you aren't in the group being vaccinated), but it also flies in the face of most public health strategies that suggest individuals be vaccinated according to their level of risk for complications.</p>
<p>For example, a July directive from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control suggested that pregnant women get the vaccine first, followed by caregivers/parents of infants, then health-care workers, babies, children, teens and, finally, adults from</p>
<p>25 to 65. Canada's Public Health Agency has yet to issue its priorities, but should do so this month.</p>
<p>As a mathematical theory, this strategy is a winner. Its practical application, however, is fraught with difficult medical and ethical issues.</p>
<p>First of all, the safety of the H1N1 vaccine is unknown. It has undergone rapid development and clinical trials on adults only began in August. Later trials will deal with its safety in other groups (such as children), but if the plan is to begin vaccinations in October or November, one can reasonably question whether researchers have had sufficient time to determine both the short- and long-term effects of the new vaccine. Canada's vaccine supplier, GlaxoSmith</p>
<p>Kline, says there will be no compromises on safety, but an editorial in an August issue of The Lancet encouraged public health leaders to "assess carefully the risks and benefits of rapid approval of an H1N1 vaccine."</p>
<p>Second, there is the issue of violating the privacy rights of children. Most are incapable of</p>
<p>giving informed consent -- they get a vaccine because their parents say so. But children and their parents might not be so compliant if they realized that children typically have fairly mild H1N1 symptoms and are at a low risk for experiencing complications. That's the irony of vaccinating children: They are the biggest transmitters of the disease, but also the least likely to experience severe symptoms.</p>
<p>So would we ever consider mandatory vaccines for schoolchildren to save us all from a pandemic?</p>
<p>The one factor that could override ethical and moral concerns about a mandatory vaccine lies in the words "epidemic" and "pandemic." These words change all the rules; suddenly the biggest concern isn't whether you get sick -- it's whether you will spread it to others.</p>
<p>The government's role is to protect society first, not individuals. If there is a pandemic, we could come to the place where authorities rule that an individual's right to refuse a vaccine ends if it affects the health of others.</p>
<p>We may not have a flu epidemic and, if we do, it might be a mere blip on the epidemiology scale. But should a true pandemic ever break out, the rules governing health care and individual rights could quickly change.</p>

<p>Average adults worried their flu symptoms might be a sign of H1N1 will never know if they have the virus.</p>
<p>Alberta Health and Wellness stopped regular testing for H1N1 a little over a month ago, spokesman John Tuckwell said Monday.</p>
<p>Only those who have been hospitalized or are experiencing severe flu symptoms are currently being tested for the specific flu strain.</p>
<p>"The resources of the test lab had to be redirected to things in the summer like West Nile virus," said Tuckwell. "From what we've seen . . . if you have influenza during summer in Canada, chances are you have a stomach one. So what we need to do is learn more from those cases that are more serious."</p>
<p>Tuckwell said there are no plans to resume regular testing this fall, when a second wave of the H1N1 flu pandemic is expected to hit.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing is that H1N1 is, for the most part, acting more like a normal flu virus," Tuckwell said. "The reason it's a pandemic is that it's considered very widespread, so it's a novel strain, but for the most part, it's producing pretty normal flu symptoms."</p>
<p>The province will continue to monitor the spread of H1N1 through the Alberta Viral Watch Program, which collects influenza reports from sentinel physicians throughout Alberta.</p>
<p>"You're not going to count every case of H1N1, but based on the testing of those sentinel physicians, you get a picture, an estimate of how much you have at any one time in the year and it's actually considered pretty accurate," said Tuckwell.</p>
<p>A halt on regular H1N1 testing is in line with recommendations by the World Health Organization, said Edmonton Dr. Mark Joffe.</p>
<p>"It is appropriate. The challenge will be to make sure we're doing enough testing to know what's happening because there will be a variety of respiratory viruses circulating," said Joffe.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Urban Canadians rank safety as No. 1 priority; Only eight per cent consider economy their top concern</b>

<div>509 words</div><div>8 September 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald    </div>

<p>H alf of urban Canadians say they are very concerned about drugs in their communities and almost as many fear guns, gangs, and random shootings.</p>
<p>Crime upstaged health care, taxes, municipal spending, transportation and the economy as the top issue in a survey of 4,393 Canadians living in nine cities and Newfoundland.</p>
<p>Twenty-two per cent of urbanites identified crime as the main issue in their area;although the results varied widely depending on the city, with Winnipeg leading the way by far.</p>
<p>The far-reaching poll, conducted for Global News by Toronto-based research firm Ipsos Reid, surveyed residents of Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax from Aug. 14-18.</p>
<p>In a series to be aired this week, Global will detail how Canadians in each community responded to almost three dozen questions, such as whether they fear the H1N1 virus, how they feel about <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and whether they are satisfied with their sex lives.</p>
<p>When asked about their specific crime worries, 52 per cent of those polled said they were "very concerned" about drug activity, as did 43 per cent about the number of guns on the streets, 41 per cent about random shootings, 39 per cent about gang activity, and 33 per cent about child abductions.</p>
<p>Twenty-three per cent agreed that they felt safe walking alone after dark in their neighbourhoods --although another 42 per cent felt somewhat safe. Also, 87 per cent of urban Canadians either strongly or somewhat agreed that their community is a great place to live.</p>
<p>"People are concerned about crime, but it's not necessarily in their own backyard," said Ipsos senior vice-president and pollster John Wright. "It also depends on what area of the country you are in."</p>
<p>He noted that the national crime rate is steadily falling, yet it only takes a few news headlines about horrific incidents to breed fear.</p>
<p>The survey found 23 per cent of city dwellers --almost one in four --strongly or somewhat agreed they had been victimized by crime in the past two years. Wright speculated that the ones who felt only somewhat victimized were hit with minor crimes that they didn't consider worth reporting to police.</p>
<p>On a national scale, health care rated as the second most pressing issue at 18 per cent, followed by taxation and municipal spending and transportation.</p>
<p>Only eight per cent of urban Canadians rated the economy as the top issue affecting their community and 75 per cent said they "strongly agree" or "somewhat agree" that the financial fortunes of their province will improve "in the next year or so."</p>
<p>The survey also showed the H1N1 virus is on the minds of Canadians --with 50 per cent reporting that they are strongly or somewhat concerned a family member will contract the illness within six months.</p>
<p>The survey has a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points.</p>

<div>Issues & Ideas</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Our ancestors would take the swine flu in stride</b>
</div><div>David Warren   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>868 words</div><div>8 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The politically correct term is now "H1N1." The original term, "swine flu" -- which caught on spontaneously, in all the European languages at least -- has been ruled politically incorrect. (I especially enjoyed the German version -- so that I was referring to the flu consistently in private conversation several months ago as Die Schweinegrippe!)</p>
<p>This was among the major decisions reached by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international authorities. Indeed the WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) combined forces on this last month, in urgent teleconferences. They pooled international expertise on political correctness in disease-naming. All progressive persons have now complied. It would be sad if millions of people died in an influenza pandemic; but how much worse if it were carrying a name that detracted from the dignity of pigs.</p>
<p>From what I can gather, as a civilian, it is anyway a mongrel virus, with genetic sequences suggestive of North American influenzas both swine and avian, plus the Eurasian swine, and the general human. In other words, swine flu was only approximately correct. Whereas, H1N1 is generically vague, and thus nearly meaningless. The term applies to the subtype of the influenza virus A that has been the cause of every major flu pandemic since La Pessadilla of 1918-19, along with half of the flu infections that arrive each fall.</p>
<p>These latter incidentally kill quite a few people, mostly invisibly to the media. For there is nothing exciting about the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Diseases are generally boring. Deaths from a major earthquake, flood or typhoon, will get proportionally much more coverage; and deaths from human acts of violence far more, in proportion to their numbers. My formula is: the more we could have done something about it, the more interesting the event will seem.</p>
<p>That "Spanish flu" of 1918-19 -- which infected perhaps one-third of the world's population, and killed up to one-fifth of those -- focused chiefly on healthy young adults. Perhaps 100 million died. There is no way to establish an accurate number, but this was possibly more than the Black Death of the 14th century, in volume, if not proportion to previous population. More, by far, than died violently in the course of the Great War, and yet the sufferings in the trenches play a larger part in our historical memory.</p>
<p>Wars seem more consequential, regardless of the casualty count. The fallout from a plague is subtler, having demographic consequences down the historical road. But wars create immediate changes on the ground -- and memorably for the worse, or better.</p>
<p>This struck me when reading English medieval history. Perhaps one-third of the English were wiped out in the "Great Pestilence" of 1348-50, and many villages disappeared from the landscape. (In other parts of Europe, three-quarters or more of the people were lost, and whole regions became depopulated). The event hardly went unnoticed, but it is not writ so large in contemporary accounts. Dynastic changes take precedence in the chronicles. The fallout from the plague is nearly ignored: such demographic effects as the loss of all the clergy in many places, who had to expose themselves repeatedly in the course of delivering last rites; the sudden loss of cultural continuities that this entailed.</p>
<p>The Black Death was an act of nature, from which the recovery was equally natural. By the end of that 14th century, silent baby booms seem already to have replaced most of the missing people. Life went on, gaps and niches filled. It went on after every revisitation of the bubonic plague, in centuries thereafter. Our ancestors took these things in their stride.</p>
<p>Should we? Granting, of course, that we should do whatever is in our power to limit death and suffering -- as human beings have always done, according to their lights -- should we give the matter more or less weight than our ancestors did?</p>
<p>There was a tendency in the past, especially the Christian past, to look upon plagues, and every other unavoidable disaster, as acts of divine judgment. This is easy enough to understand, for in the best of times most of us deserve hanging, and the prospect of mortality has ever helped to concentrate the mind.</p>
<p>Today, with an unquestionably improved understanding of the material causes of infection, we are inclined to think of ourselves, when sick and likely to die, as pure victims of nature. We easily forget that on that account, by our very existence, we are pure beneficiaries of nature, and what is taken away can be no more than what was given. In the old Christian account, "each of us owes a death."</p>
<p>It is a paradox, worth pondering, that with such "backward" attitudes, and suspicions of divine retribution, our ancestors may have done a better job of coping with disaster.</p>

<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>KENNEDY NEPHEW WON'T RUN FOR SENATE</p>
<p>NEW YORK -- Joseph Kennedy, the nephew of the late Edward Kennedy, announced Monday he will not seek to fill his uncle's vacant Senate seat.</p>
<p>The statement, two weeks after Kennedy's death, made it unlikely that another member of the famed Democratic Party clan would try for the high office.</p>
<p>"Given all that my uncle accomplished, it was only natural to consider getting back involved in public office," said Kennedy on the website of the non-profit organization he founded, Citizens Energy.</p>
<p>"After much consideration, I have decided that the best way for me to contribute to those causes is by continuing my work at <span class="companylink">Citizens Energy Corporation</span>."</p>
<p>Edward Kennedy held the Senate seat for almost four decades, giving the Boston-based family a major presence in Washington long after the assassinations of both president John F. Kennedy in 1963 and Robert F. Kennedy, as he campaigned for the White House, in 1968.</p>
<p>Joe Kennedy served in the House of Representatives, but left Congress in 1988.</p>
<p>The only other member of the family who some speculate could challenge for Ted Kennedy's seat is his widow Victoria.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WINS LOTTERY</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM -- An illegal immigrant who scored a big win with a lottery scratch card in Sweden appeared on television on Saturday to collect his winnings even though authorities have been trying to deport him.</p>
<p>Tesfaldet Tesloy, a 28-year-old Eritrean who has lived in the immigrant-friendly Nordic country for six years, won a tax-free prize of 1.2 million Swedish crown (US$166,300).</p>
<p>But Sweden's attempts to deport the man have failed due to his country's refusal to take him back, highlighting a common problem for immigration officials.</p>
<p>Sweden says it has about 12,000 people awaiting deportation. Of those, Tesloy is one of hundreds living illegally in Sweden who cannot be sent home because their home countries refuse to have them back unless they agree to being deported.</p>
<p>Countries such as Iran, Cuba and the east African nation of Eritrea all ignore or refuse to cooperate with the deportation orders, leaving the immigrants stuck in a legal no-man's land.</p>
<p>One immigration official described the deportation process as "difficult," since few immigrants who come to Sweden seeking political refuge can be convinced to leave voluntarily.</p>
<p>"They are not allowed to be here ... and we are unable to deport them, and they won't leave voluntarily," Leo Garpenhielm at the Stockholm County Border Police said.</p>
<p>While Tesloy's lucky lottery break was deemed entirely legal by the Swedish National Lottery, he is not allowed to work in Sweden but told Reuters he has now plans to become a licensed physical therapist.</p>
<p>21ST DUTCH SOLDIER DIES IN AFGHANISTAN</p>
<p>THE HAGUE -- A Dutch soldier with the NATO forces in Afghanistan died on Monday when his army vehicle drove over an improvised explosive device in the province of Uruzgan, the defence ministry said.</p>
<p>Sergeant-Major Mark Leijsen, 44, became the 21st member of the 1,800-strong Dutch contingent in Afghanistan to die since 2006.</p>
<p>Three other Dutch troops and an Aghan interpreter who were with Leijsen in the vehicle were injured in the explosion, said a ministry statement. They were all in a stable condition.</p>
<p>About 2,000 Dutch soldiers are deployed in Afghanistan, mostly in the southern Uruzgan province, as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.</p>
<p>Another Dutch soldier died on Sunday after being wounded in a firefight with suspected Taliban insurgents.</p>
<p>RECESSION EASING TRAFFIC CONGESTION</p>
<p>LONDON -- Congestion in Britain has dropped by almost a third in the last two years as motorists struggle through the worst recession in decades, according to research released Monday.</p>
<p>Rising unemployment and fuel prices have all contributed to the fall in traffic on all major motorways and main roads, the report by motoring group AA and road information company <span class="companylink">Trafficmaster</span> said.</p>
<p>Cash-strapped commuters have also been car pooling or taking public transport to cut down on costs, while other motorists surveyed said they were now working more often from home, the report said.</p>
<p>"We've been collecting and analyzing congestion data for the past 20 years, with all previous years up to 2007 showing the congestion problem growing," said Georgina Read from <span class="companylink">Trafficmaster</span>.</p>
<p>"However, post credit crunch, the trend has been well and truly broken and we've now witnessed two consecutive years of dramatically falling congestion levels," she said.</p>
<p>While the drop is good news for motorists still battling the traffic, the report also shows congestion has jumped on Fridays and public holidays, as families hit the roads for cheaper holidays at home instead of abroad.</p>
<p>"The report brings both good news and bad news; it shows that congestion is falling, but also that this is due to the recession, fuel prices and unemployment," said AA president Edmund King.</p>
<p>FRENCH SWINE FLU CASES ON THE RISE</p>
<p>BASEL, Switzerland -- France is currently facing about 20,000 cases of swine flu every week, a figure much higher than official estimates, the region-by-region flu monitoring agency GROG said Monday.</p>
<p>"On average, we have in France up to 20,000 cases per week," GROG's director Jean-Marie Cohen told reporters during a conference in Basel on the antiviral drug Tamiflu, made by Swiss pharmaceutical group Roche.</p>
<p>A spike of 23,000 new cases was recorded at the end of August, and according to GROG estimates, about 71,800 people contracted the disease in metropolitan France from July 27 to August 31.</p>
<p>The Institute of Health Monitoring (InVS), a branch of the French health ministry, previously said there were 5,000 cases during the week of August 24-30.</p>
<p>OCEANIA</p>
<p>MAN FINDS HUGE SNAKE IN TOILET</p>
<p>SYDNEY -- An Australian man will be putting his toilet seat down in the future after discovering a python almost twice his size curled up in the bowl.</p>
<p>Snake wrangler Chris Peberdy was called to a house in rural Virginia near Darwin in far northern Australia after the owner, Erik Rantzau, spotted a three-metre-long (almost 10 feet) carpet python in his toilet.</p>
<p>"It's not unusual to find snakes of that size in the tropics but you don't find usually them in toilets," Peberdy told Reuters.</p>
<p>"He must have come up through a drain. He was cruising around the house at night and returning to the toilet by day."</p>
<p>Peberdy, who runs Darwin-based snake handling company Snake N.T., said the owner lives on a rural property where snakes are respected, so he left the python alone and used a different bathroom until it could be safely removed.</p>
<p>It took the snake wrangler four trips out to the house to catch the carpet python, which is non-venomous and kills its prey by constriction.</p>
<p>The captured snake was released back into the bush about 2.5 kms (1.5 miles) from the house.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>TROUSER WOMAN JAILED FOR A MONTH</p>
<p>KHARTOUM, Sudan -- A Sudanese woman was convicted Monday of public indecency for wearing pants at an outdoor cafe and jailed for one month when she refused to pay a fine.</p>
<p>The case has stirred international outrage and spawned protests in Sudan over the Islamic-dominated government's treatment of women.</p>
<p>Lubna Hussein, a journalist and former United Nations staffer based in Khartoum, the capital, could have received 40 lashes with a plastic whip under Sudan's criminal code, which is based largely on Islamic Sharia law.</p>
<p>Instead, a judge ordered Hussein -- who stood before the court in the same pair of pants she wore when arrested -- to pay a $200 fine. Hussein said she would refuse to pay, and she was taken to a women's prison to serve a one-month sentence.</p>
<p>"If I paid, it would mean I'd lost the battle," Hussein said after the verdict was announced. "I would rather serve my time in jail."</p>
<p>Hussein was arrested earlier this year with a dozen other women, most of whom paid a fine or were lashed.</p>
<p>Western nations lodged complaints about the case. The human-rights group Amnesty International likened public floggings to "state-sponsored torture."</p>
<p>Hussein, believed to be in her 30s, said she hoped her case would spotlight the repressive treatment of women in Sudan.</p>
<p>Government officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>AFGHAN 'BLASPHEMY' JOURNALIST FREED</p>
<p>KABUL -- An Afghan journalist imprisoned for 20 years for blasphemy for downloading an Internet article about women's rights and Islam has been released, an international media rights group said Monday.</p>
<p>Sayed Perwiz Kambakhsh, 24, was freed early after President Hamid Karzai signed a pardon a few weeks ago, Reporters Without Borders said, citing the journalist's lawyer.</p>
<p>"This case will be remembered as a miscarriage of justice marked by religious intolerance, police mistreatment and incompetence on the part of certain judges," said RSF secretary general Jean-Francois Julliard.</p>
<p>Kabul now must ensure that blasphemy, as defined in Afghanistan's Sharia-based constitution, "is no longer used to bring politically motivated charges and to suppress free expression," he added.</p>
<p>Kambakhsh, a reporter for the Jahan-e-Naw (New World) newspaper, was arrested in October 2007, then sentenced to die by a tribunal in Mazar-i-Sharif in January 2008 for downloading from an Iranian website an analysis of what the Koran says about women, RSF said.</p>
<p>That sentence was changed to 20 years' imprisonment by an appeals court.</p>

<p>Does better-safe-than-sorry apply more to joining the mass inoculation being planned against the H1N1 virus or choosing not to because of dangers in doing so?</p>
<p>At latest report, 72 deaths have been attributed to this flu. A small number when compared with the little broadcast fact, influenza results in an average of 20,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths each year, yet magnified each time a death occurs.</p>
<p>The federal government's purchase of 50.4 million doses of vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline Plc</span> is a concern. Adjuvants ingredients have had harmful effects in the past and while Glaxo has said its adjuvant has proven safe and effective in clinical trials with 39,000 people, the additive isn't yet approved in the U.S.</p>
<p>The federal government's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said clinical trials for the vaccine are still on track for early this fall. His aim is to ensure safety and effectiveness but these are always value judgements.</p>
<p>Unlike previous destructive experiences with governments‚ pandemic panic reactions, this time all potential dangers must be clearly laid before the public.</p>
<p>Advertising must be of the positive steps that can be taken in everyday living to avoid catching all influenzas and transmitting them to others, rather than scare tactics that have been used in the past.</p>
<p>Positive steps can be taken immediately in hospitals and schools to make alcohol-based sanitizer, gel or wipes, not only available, as has been done in hospitals but obligatory upon entering.</p>
<p>Which risk is the greater, catching this flu declared to be the equivalent of the spanish flu or suffering debilitating effects from a hurriedly prepared vaccine said to contain dangerous ingredients?</p>
<p>Governments must be pressed to provide all data available so individuals can make informed decisions for themselves and their families.</p>

<p>When Jane Langille sends her son off to school tomorrow, the Richmond Hill mother will be tucking a little something extra into his lunch bag: a small bottle of hand sanitizer to combat swine flu.</p>
<p>"I don't want to panic, but I just think it makes sense to be prudent. It's really hard on everybody when someone is sick, so if you can minimize it, why not?" she says of her efforts to keep Jamie, 16, healthy.</p>
<p>With a second wave of the H1N1 virus expected this fall, protecting children is top of mind for both parents and educators.</p>
<p>Schools are on the frontline in the battle against H1N1 because influenza viruses are known to spread in places where people congregate. In the southeast United States, where classes have already resumed, swine flu is spreading faster than in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Even though influenza viruses typically lie low in the summer, this one has been active since it first hit in the spring. Nine Ontario summer camps experienced outbreaks of H1N1 this summer. Though there has been a decrease in overall activity since June, the rate of influenza-like illness is still above what is expected for this time of year, particularly for those under age 20.</p>
<p>The concern is that, once schools are back in session, there will be a renewed opportunity for the virus to spread. Primary grades and daycares, in particular, are ideal breeding grounds for viruses that can be spread to family members.</p>
<p>Ontario's guidelines for managing H1N1 in schools notes that younger children are most at risk to acquire the virus.</p>
<p>"Presumably (that is) due to difficulty in maintaining routine practice in hand hygiene and appropriate coughing/sneezing etiquette," the guidelines state.</p>
<p>That is because the classic variables that allow for the spread of infection exist in schools: a susceptible host, a contagious agent and a welcoming environment, says Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"We have to make interventions in all three areas," she says. "We have to do as much as we can to protect the hosts from their own behaviours, change the environment to reduce transmission and keep the virus or the agent out as much as possible."</p>
<p>The Canadian and provincial governments are recommending against school closures as a measure to contain the spread of the virus. But school board officials say a school may have to close if a large number of staff fall ill and there are not enough teachers to watch over students.</p>
<p>Public health officials are counting on schools to play a key role in slowing the spread of the virus. Schools have been plastered with posters on hand-washing techniques, hand-sanitizing dispensers have been installed in classrooms without sinks and letters are being sent to parents, emphasizing the need to keep sick children home.</p>
<p>"Parents need to have a contingency plan. If your child gets sick, who's going to stay home? Is there an alternative if you can't stay home?" asks Dr. Barbara Yaffe, director of communicable disease control and associate medical officer of health for Toronto.</p>
<p>One of the first lessons of the new school year for many students, especially younger children, will be a primer on sneezing and coughing. Forget about covering your mouth with your hands. That technique, once considered good manners, is now known to spread bugs. Coughing or sneezing into your arm is a better way to contain airborne respiratory droplets.</p>
<p>Sharing - another normally polite behaviour - is also out the window this coming flu season.</p>
<p>"Students should be encouraged to use their own pens, pencils, tissues, etc. at school to reduce the need to share supplies," state the provincial guidelines.</p>
<p>"This is not just young children but adults as well. Teenagers tend to share things like water bottles, cups, food, cigarettes and lipstick," King says.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control has enlisted the help of Sesame Street's Elmo for television ads teaching proper hygiene habits to children.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama even took to the airwaves recently, urging viewers to do their part to curtail the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>The messages are simple but can't be overstated. They include:</p>
<p>Wash hands with soap and warm running water for at least 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Avoid touching eyes, mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Use hand-sanitizer that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, retailers are getting in on the action, filling store shelves with germ-fighting products to help prevent the spread of bugs. One company is even marketing back-to-school value packs of disinfecting wipes.</p>
<p>Parents, like Langille, are snapping up travel-size bottles of alcohol rub. "There are 1,600-plus kids at my son's school. It's a big collection of people altogether and who knows what could happen. That's why I think it's smart to be prudent," she says.</p>
<p>Parents are being urged to have their children inoculated when vaccines become available.</p>
<p>"Influenza vaccination is still the best way to prevent getting the flu," states a letter from Dr. Kathleen Dooling, associate medical officer of health for Peel, posted on the region's public school board website. The regular seasonal flu shot will be ready in early October while the H1N1 vaccine will be available later in the fall.</p>
<p>Unlike the oubreak in spring, parents will not be notified if a student in their child's school becomes ill.</p>
<p>That's because most people who become ill with H1N1 have not had it confirmed through a lab test.</p>
<p>Secondly, when parents are notified of school cases, they may assume that once those students are well, the school is free of H1N1 - which can leave parents with a false sense of security.</p>
<p>"It's a community-acquired infection and it could be anywhere. Parents should assume there could be cases in schools," Yaffe says.</p>

<p>Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff doesn't want an election any more than the rest of us. Fighting another federal election -- within one year of the last one -- doesn't make sense for him or his still debt-ridden party. He knows that.</p>
<p>His poll numbers aren't great, he hasn't articulated any platform or policies that will grab hold of the imaginations of a weary electorate, and the Grits' electoral campaign cupboard is bare.</p>
<p>As for Ignatieff himself, his popularity numbers actually poll below those of his party. As one politico confided to me, "To know him is not to love him."</p>
<p>Since Ignatieff orchestrated his Liberal leadership coronation following Stéphane Dion's coalition-in-waiting with the Bloc Québécois, he has not experienced much of a post-leadership bump in the polls. No honeymoon for Iggy. When it came to his love affair with the Canadian electorate, he started sleeping on the couch by the second or third week.</p>
<p>So, what gives? Why did he on Tuesday state: "Mr. Harper, your time is up. The Liberal Party cannot support this government any further. We will hold it to account. We will oppose it in Parliament."</p>
<p>Sounds like he means it. Unlike previous blusterings that he would bring the Tories down, this time he didn't couch it with the word "unless." There is no way Ignatieff can back out of this threat this time. He will have to follow through and vote against Stephen Harper's government on a confidence motion at the first opportunity or lose credibility for a very long time.</p>
<p>Does he really want to go to the polls on the issues he articulated in his speech? "Stephen Harper ... failed to stand up for Canadians," he said and then mentioned Omar Khadr. Considering that Liberal PMs Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin both failed to stand up for Khadr will make that a tough sell, not to mention that the Khadr family is political poison. My sense is that most Canadians don't want to welcome back Khadr (though it remains the right thing to do).</p>
<p>Ignatieff also railed against Canada letting the world down on medical isotopes, saying Harper "cancelled the MAPLE reactors that would have guaranteed Canadian leadership in isotope supply." Nice try, but the MAPLE reactors weren't cancelled so much as they just don't work and never have. They were commissioned by Chrétien, went tens of millions of dollars over budget, were years behind schedule and experts believe they are unsalvageable. How is that Harper's fault?</p>
<p>Then there's employment insurance. Ignatieff wants Canadians to be eligible to take a year off drawing EI benefits after working just nine weeks. Not surprisingly, the Tories would love to go to an election on that idiotic piece of public policy. The very people this idea was supposed to entice -- autoworkers losing their jobs -- are outraged. Why should some pimply kid whose summer job comes to an end get to draw EI benefits at the same rate as that autoworker who has paid into the system for decades? It'll be popular among the ski-bum crowd, but few others.</p>
<p>Basically, Ignatieff's Tuesday speech at the Liberal caucus retreat in Sudbury was delivered more for the benefit of the Bloc and the NDP than for the governing Tories.</p>
<p>Ignatieff is gambling that the Bloc and the New Democrats don't want to go to the polls, either. Now he's telling them it's their turn to prop up the Tory minority government.</p>
<p>Neither party is awash in cash to fight another election and the NDP isn't exactly flying high in the polls. While the Bloc's popularity is up since last fall's election, nearly 40 per cent of the separatist party's 49 caucus members were elected in 2004, which means they won't be eligible to collect their lucrative MP pensions, should they lose their seats.</p>
<p>MPs must serve at least six years before being able to collect the gold-plated pensions that start paying out at age 55 until death. The same holds true for some 60 other MPs in other political parties.</p>
<p>Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe says he will always do what's best for Quebecers and vote in the House of Commons issue by issue.</p>
<p>Wanna bet he'll just shrug his shoulders and declare that Quebecers don't want another election?</p>
<p>And when he really can't bring himself to vote for something, it's pretty likely the NDP will then find something to like. Both leaders will have each others' private phone lines on speed dial.</p>
<p>Or, here's an even easier out. The Tories, with their 142 seats out of 308, only need 13 votes from another party to not lose a confidence vote. Either that, or 13 opposition members will suddenly call in sick.</p>
<p>If I were a betting gal, I'd lay down a fair chunk of bacon that sniffles and purported cases of the swine flu will save us all from going to the polls this fall.</p>

<p>The world's finest skilled trades competitors took to the podium in a dazzling WorldSkills awards ceremony Sunday, the grand finale of the weeklong event that saw Calgary set a gold standard in hosting the international competition and Team Canada smash its own record for awards.</p>
<p>Competitors and organizers say they were blown away by WorldSkills Calgary.</p>
<p>"This has been the best competition ever," WorldSkills International president Jack Dusseldorp told thousands of spectators from around the world filling the seats and waving flags at the Stampede Corral.</p>
<p>The spectacular opening and closing ceremonies, the "legendary friendliness" of Calgarians and the outstanding international competition made the 40th WorldSkills event the finest on record, he said.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you will agree that Calgary has set a high standard for London 2011."</p>
<p>Sunday's ceremony was the culmination of four days of intense competition. Confetti and streamers flew and dancers filled the aisles as pulsing music and sweeping lights ushered winners to the stage.</p>
<p>Team Canada quickly nabbed a spot on the podium, with Brian Everts winning silver in aircraft mechanics. It was the first of Canada's eight medals, including three golds --its best showing since winning six medals two years ago at WorldSkills in Shizuoka, Japan.</p>
<p>---</p>

<p>Cheers reached a roaring volume several times Sunday.</p>
<p>Before the ceremony even began, competitors from around the world began a spontaneous march around the arena floor, waving flags to thousands of appreciative spectators who got to their feet and whistled and hollered for their favourite team.</p>
<p>"I think it was the best," said a beaming Marvin Robinson, 22, a cooking competitor from Team Jamaica.</p>
<p>"This is huge," he said as the opening ceremony geared up.</p>
<p>Team Austria's Patrick Herrmuller said facing off with the world's best has been an overwhelming opportunity.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to find the words," he said.</p>
<p>"It was so intense, but so interesting."</p>
<p>The major technology, trades and skilled professions event has drawn the eyes of the world to Calgary throughout the week.</p>
<p>Crowds of visitors streamed the gates of Stampede Park to watch the four days of intense competition, which is expected to pump more than $82 million into the local economy. About 900 competitors from 51 teams around the world went toe-to-toe in a variety of skills and trades.</p>
<p>"It was extraordinary. All of the elements came together," said World-Skills Calgary president Richard Walker.</p>
<p>"I think Canada hosted the world brilliantly.</p>
<p>"It's really raised awareness to the value of skills and how skills inject vibrancy to the economy, and the importance of education and skilled professions in the economy."</p>
<p>Organizers began dismantling the massive WorldSkills facelift at the Stampede grounds after the last competition Friday. Trucks, semis and forklifts started pulling down the 400 tonnes of equipment carted in especially for the event, Walker said.</p>
<p>Some of the $16-million worth of brand-new tools has already been packaged up and labelled with the names of various school districts, where the equipment will find a new home, he added.</p>
<p>Overall, the event has been one for Calgary's history book, Walker said.</p>
<p>"The legacy is manifold. It's $16 million of state of the art equipment coming into the school system, a legacy of raised awareness of skilled trades . . . a lasting legacy of friendships that have been made internationally," said Walker.</p>
<p>Cheer over the successful competition was clouded by the sad H1N1-related death of a New Zealand man related to a competitor.</p>
<p>Organizers did what they could to provide support to the family, Walker said.</p>
<p>"It was a sad moment for the WorldSkills family. Our hearts went out to the competitor and her family. We tried as a host city to make sure we were doing everything to support the family and the New Zealand Team."</p>
<p>Overall, organizers are pleased with the event. Weather also co-operated, with sunny skies throughout the competition, Walker said.</p>
<p>According to Walker, the seven-day event is on target to exceed to the 150,000 attendance goal, including visitors from the closing ceremonies, farewell party and tailgate party for the Labour Day classic football game today.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Premier Ed Stelmach and other government officials dropped in on WorldSkills throughout the week. Dignitaries from around the world also attended to cheer on their home teams, Walker said.</p>
<p>"The WorldSkills experience has been extraordinary. I've heard from official delegates from countries around the world that have attended 12 or 15 events in the past years. To a person, they said that this is the best world skills they've seen and the community support is amazing," Walker said.</p>
<p>As many as 50,000 Alberta students visited the competition.</p>
<p>The "roller-coaster week" saw a series of ups and downs as the 38-member Canadian team rolled up their sleeves and faced off with competitors from around the world.</p>
<p>Competing on home turf has been an added bonus throughout the week, said Canada's team leader, Luc Morin.</p>
<p>"They felt so much Canadian pride this week, it's unbelievable."</p>
<p>Competitors are looking forward to some down time today at the Labour Day classic football game at Mc-Mahon Stadium, which will honour award winners at halftime.</p>
<p>The competition was fierce.</p>
<p>"I'm feeling pretty good. I did have a few troubles, some things didn't go quite as well as I hoped, but it was a great experience. I enjoyed all of it," said Karl Loos, a CNC milling competitor from Whitehorse, YT.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old says the skill is complex, and involves producing cylindrical components through metal cutting using computer numerically controlled lathes.</p>
<p>The experience has been worthwhile, Loos said.</p>
<p>"I've got tons of training I never would have if I hadn't been in this."</p>

<p>The New Zealand man who died of H1N1 influenza while in Calgary at WorldSkills has been identified.</p>
<p>Paul William Hartigan, 41, of New Plymouth, arrived in Calgary to support his stepdaughter, Kirsty Lister, an army steward who competed in restaurant service, according to the Taranaki Daily News newspaper.</p>
<p>He died Thursday.</p>
<p>His wife, Roslyn, is in quarantine, the newspaper reports.</p>
<p>Hartigan is believed to have been suffering flu symptoms before arriving in Calgary. He began showing symptoms once in Canada and was admitted to a hospital on Tuesday, only to die two days later.</p>
<p>It can take up to a week for a patient to begin showing flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Many of the individuals to die from H1N1 have had some sort of pre-existing medical condition.</p>
<p>In the wake of Hartigan's death, New Zealand's deputy director of public health is calling on Alberta health officials to continue monitoring for flu symptoms before hundreds of WorldSkills competitors begin boarding flights for home.</p>
<p>Lister was initially quarantined after her stepfather's death as a precaution. She has not shown symptoms of illness, but withdrew from her event.</p>
<p>Hartigan was reported to be a runner who competed in marathons with his wife, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>The New Zealand man is the eighth person with H1N1 to die in Alberta since it appeared earlier this year. The virus has infected more than 1,600 people in the province and Alberta Health expects a resurgence of cases as fall approaches.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, where the winter flu season is wrapping up, health officials are reporting 3,145 confirmed H1N1 cases and 17 deaths from the virus.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Farmers COOL to U.S. protectionism</b>
</div><div>Milton Boyd   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>699 words</div><div>7 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Struggling U.S. livestock producers --hit hard by the recent economic downturn and the drop in demand for meat in the United States--have spurred trade protectionism measures, including country of origin labelling regulations (COOL), that essentially require U.S. meat processors to segregate live Canadian cattle and hogs from U.S. animals.</p>
<p>Any packages containing Canadian meat must be labelled as such, but this separate labelling has been costly for most U.S. processors who have consequently been unwilling to accept Canadian animals at all.</p>
<p>COOL has resulted in a tightened, protectionist border. Canadian hog exports to the U.S. for market pigs have dropped to 585,000 pigs from January through June. That compares to 1.4 million for the same period a year earlier--about a 60-per-cent drop.</p>
<p>At $100-per-hog market value, this loss is around$81.5 million, or$163 million over a full year (not to mention a 30-per-cent drop in feeder pig exports). Slaughter-cattle exports are down 20 per cent, feeder-cattle exports down by 50 per cent.</p>
<p>In May, Canada requested a WTO consultation to object to the U.S. regulations. While the U.S. administration and Democrats in the House and Senate talk free trade, their actions have been the opposite and have restricted trade.</p>
<p>These restrictions are being championed by a small number of U.S. agricultural producer groups, primarily R-CALF and the National Farmers Union--American agriculture groups who represent only a minority of farmers but who successfully lobbied the U.S. government to impose the COOL regulations.</p>
<p>Part of the dispute is related to the new U.S. secretary of Agriculture's decision to aggressively enforce the country-of-origin labelling.</p>
<p>But this isn't surprising, since Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both stated in last year's presidential debates they would consider renegotiating NAFTA and were supported by anti-trade groups. This is in contrast to the Bush administration, which mostly let trade flow freely.</p>
<p>Keeping U.S. and international markets open for Canadian livestock is especially important for the financial survival of Canadian producers. They have been hit hard by high feed-grain prices driven up by U.S. ethanol policy, weak livestock prices, a strong Canadian dollar, mad cow disease-related border closures for cattle, and H1N1-related border closures for pork to some countries. Enforcing country-of-origin labelling was a further blow.</p>
<p>In the long term, aU. S. market loss for Canadian live animals would require building more meat processing capacity in Canada. More exports of Canadian processed beef and pork would go to Asia, given the rising Asian income and growing market, since it's too expensive to ship live animals to Asia.</p>
<p>However, Canada's meat processing plant size is smaller and less cost-competitive than the huge U.S. plants, so Canada still needs to export live animals to the U.S., especially in the short term.</p>
<p>For now, fighting COOL is the first priority for Canada. With a population one-tenth of the U.S., and 75 per cent of its trade dependent on the our southern neighbour, Canada must band together with other countries to convince the Obama administration to drop its wrong-headed trade restrictions.</p>
<p>Back in 1930, U.S. tariffs were increased on 20,000 products as a means to rescue the U.S. from an economic downturn, in the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. That approach should serve as a reminder of the dangers of protectionism now.</p>
<p>Smoot-Hawley backfired and created a world trade war, and was a significant cause of the Great Depression. Trade fell by 65 per cent, and unemployment hit 25 per cent.</p>
<p>Archaic trade restrictions from the U.S. administration were tried in 1930 and brought the world economy to its knees--and they're still nonsensical today. As baseball great Yogi Berra said, "It sounds like deja vu all over again. "</p>

<p>A Spanish restaurateur, fearing a drop in business due to swine flu, is seeking to pull in customers by offering a sanitized--and hopefully virus-free--environment.</p>
<p>Miguel Angel de la Cruz, manager of the Mesa y Placer (Table and Pleasure) eatery in Madrid, said he was forced to act ahead of a feared second wave of swine flu this autumn, which is "more dangerous to business than the economic crisis."</p>
<p>"We are facing a very difficult autumn. We have therefore had to try and anticipate the impact of the H1N1 flu, which has completely paralyzed the sector in Mexico," said de la Cruz.</p>
<p>So, instead of a free aperitif, his customers receive disinfectant hand gel and a sanitized napkin before reading menus that are covered in plastic to reduce the risk of contamination.</p>
<p>The meals are prepared by chefs wearing surgical face masks, and all staff must have their body temperatures checked before starting work to ensure they do not have the flu.</p>
<p>De la Cruz said another Madrid restaurant in the same group, Plato y Placer, in a more touristy district of the city, has introduced the same measures.</p>
<p>There, "the Japanese, who are very careful about hygiene, make up a large part of the clientele. They are coming less, but with these measures we hope they will return," he said.</p>

<p>THOMPSON, Man. -- The fact that the H1N1 flu hit his remote community of Garden Hill hard wasn't surprising to Chief David Harper.</p>
<p>With no running water, poor living conditions and limited access to health care, Harper said it was a miracle Garden Hill wasn't devastated when dozens of its residents got sick last spring.</p>
<p>"In one month we spent over $300,000 on medevacs alone getting help for our people. That's not including doctors' fees," said Harper, chief of the reserve 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. "We learned something last season - and that is we have to prepare now."</p>
<p>Garden Hill was hit particularly hard as the H1N1 virus spread around the world last spring. Stricken residents from there and nearby St. Theresa Point spent weeks on ventilators.</p>
<p>Harper and other native leaders were speaking out after a national conference on the virus ended in Winnipeg last Thursday.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar, a specialist in intensive care units (ICUs), told the conference that Manitoba was unprepared when the virus sent hundreds to hospital in the spring.</p>
<p>Then the province, said Kumar, missed a chance during the virus's dormant period in the summer to plan ICU care for critically ill patients when the next wave of the disease hits, expected this fall.</p>
<p>"We had this golden, beautiful opportunity during the summer," Kumar told reporters. "We didn't get it done. I think that's a great loss."</p>
<p>Despite that, he said the province is as ready as it can be for the next wave. That optimism was echoed by Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, who told the conference the country is as prepared as any in world.</p>
<p>"It's uncertain what we're going to face ... but I think the systems that we have in place will help us to respond quickly," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>He and federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq faced criticism after health officials said the swine flu vaccine would be ready in Canada in mid-November - a month behind its forecast arrival in the U.S.</p>
<p>But Butler-Jones told the conference Canada might also have it available in October. "Those who need it most will receive the vaccine first," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Aglukkaq announced funding for 16 nursing stations in remote communities in Manitoba.</p>
<p>But that's not going to help reserves like his prepare for this fall's return of H1N1, said Harper, who was recently elected grand chief of the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, which represents most reserves in northern Manitoba.</p>
<p>Harper said a dedicated team of three or four doctors and nurses must fly in and vaccinate residents as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The return of children to school, he said, poses both an opportunity for mass immunization and the threat of fast-spreading infection.</p>
<p>Chief Marcel Balfour of Norway House, 450 kilometres north of Winnipeg, said natives weren't included at the conference until the last moment and they have been left out on policy decisions.</p>
<p>Balfour said his reserve can't wait for political decisions on vaccinations - it must start preparing now.</p>
<p>"I didn't create the condition on these reserves, but we need to improve living conditions here if we're going to deal with H1N1," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Education funding cut; School boards hold emergency meetings</b>
</div><div>Lena Sin </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>584 words</div><div>6 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province </div>
</p>
<p>As students head back to school this week, school boards across the province will be holding emergency meetings to grapple with funding cuts.</p>
<p>"We've had the annual facilities grant cut, pulling the rug out on trustees who were counting on that money -- so that's $110 million gone -- and we've got a frozen budget and increased costs," says Susan Lambert, vice-president of the B.C. Teachers Federation.</p>
<p>"The pressure for local school boards to manage the finances is going to be huge. There's going to be emergency meetings across the province."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education announced last week that it was scrapping the $110-million annual facilities grant, which had been used by school districts for maintenance and repair work.</p>
<p>However, many school districts undertake capital projects in the summer -- and have already spent at least a portion of the anticipated funding.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, school trustees are holding their first board meeting Tuesday night, followed by a second emergency meeting Wednesday. The facilities grant was worth $10.6 million to Vancouver schools.</p>
<p>Vancouver school trustee Allan Wong, chairman of the board's planning and facilities committee, said ongoing projects that started over the summer will leave the district $200,000 in the red. On top of that, there are costly "must-do" projects for the upcoming school year, including an annual $400,000 fire-extinguisher check that is required by regulation, and asbestos removal.</p>
<p>The school board now needs to come up with ways to make up for the funding shortfall -- and that could mean layoffs.</p>
<p>"We're scrambling and working really hard to try and find some alternatives, but it's looking very much like we're going to have to do layoffs and some very significant cuts," said Jane Bouey, vice-chair of the Vancouver School Board.</p>
<p>Various projects that can be stopped -- such as retrofitting of washrooms at Vancouver Technical School -- have already been halted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, layoff notices have already been issued to 50 staff members at the Okanagan Skaha School District as a result of the grant cut, which was worth $1.3 million to the district.</p>
<p>"Issuing layoff notice to one out of every six regular staff in the district has thrown the beginning of school period into chaos," said CUPE 523 president Zoe Magnus in a statement. "Instead of ensuring that we are ready for a challenging year -- with the threat of H1N1 and dealing with already reduced resources -- we are scrambling to figure out who will be left to do the work."</p>
<p>Education Minister Margaret MacDiarmid told The Province that most school districts have money left in their contingency revenues and should be able to fund most of their maintenance and repair projects with that money.</p>
<p>Wong disputes the assertion, saying that in Vancouver the original grant was insufficient to begin with and there is no contingency money.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said school districts should contact the ministry if there's any work that involves the health and safety of students.</p>
<p>The ministry expects 7,000 fewer students to enroll in school this fall.</p>
<p>- TransLink is warning students and workers to prepare for big crowds on Tuesday -- especially the Canada Line. Richmond commuters are reminded that six bus lines that went direct from Richmond to Vancouver are being eliminated.</p>

</div><div>Sarah McGinnis    </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>542 words</div><div>6 September 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald    </div>
</p>
<p>I n the wake of a New Zealand man's death of H1N1 influenza in Calgary this week, New Zealand's deputy director of public health is calling on Alberta health officials to continue monitoring for flu symptoms before hundreds of WorldSkills competitors begin boarding flights for home.</p>
<p>The flu death has raised concerns among some international visitors here this week, but it didn't keep thousands of people from heading to the Stampede grounds Saturday to take in the final hours of the global skills and trades competition.</p>
<p>"Before getting on a plane the local health authority should be checking to see if everyone is feeling well and monitoring for symptoms," said Dr. Darren Hunt, deputy director of public health for New Zealand's ministry of health.</p>
<p>"From what I've seen (Alberta Health Services) is doing that."</p>
<p>The stepfather of one of the female New Zealand competitors, who passed away Thursday, is believed to have contracted the flu before arriving in Calgary.</p>
<p>He began showing symptoms once in Canada and was admitted to a local hospital Tuesday.</p>
<p>"This passing seems consistent with what we have seen on incubation periods," said Hunt, who added it can take up to a week for a patient to begin showing flu symptoms.</p>
<p>"The fact is he most likely picked it up either on the plane or in New Zealand," he said.</p>
<p>New Zealand is nearing the end of its traditional flu season which saw the number of H1N1 cases spike in July, said Hunt.</p>
<p>He said Alberta health officials are talking to the relatives of the deceased man, assessing the level of risk to everyone the patient came in contact with and monitoring family members for symptoms as a precaution.</p>
<p>Anyone arriving in New Zealand will also receive information on what symptoms to watch for and how to report them should they feel ill after returning home, he said.</p>
<p>Back in Calgary, a brief message on the WorldSkills New Zealand online diary hints at the drama taking place half a world away from home.</p>
<p>"Everyone is, of course, devastated by the death of the father of one of our competitors but despite this the team has remained focused on their competition and most of them had a good day's work on their projects. Everyone has been checked out and they are all fit and healthy," the site said.</p>
<p>The lone case hasn't appeared to affect overall attendance, said Walker.</p>
<p>Attendance numbers were not available for Saturday. But during the first three days of competition, more than 78,000 people visited Stampede grounds, including 46,745 schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Weliton Batisti of Brazil spent years perfecting his talents in the field of CNC turning. As he wrapped up his event, the 22-year-old competitor said he was more concerned about learning what medal he might have earned than being exposed to the flu.</p>
<p>H1N1 may have dominated some coverage of WorldSkills Calgary, but Batisti said it will be the city's diversity and quality of life that he will remember most--not the flu.</p>

<p>Soap and Water & Common Sense</p>
<p>The Definitive Guide to Viruses, Bacteria,</p>
<p>Parasites and Disease</p>
<p>By Dr. Bonnie Henry</p>
<p>House of Anansi, 304 pages, $20</p>
<p>With its impressive combination of meticulous research and excellent writing, this is an invaluable handbook for anyone trying to stay healthy in a germ-infested universe.</p>
<p>Vancouver-based Dr. Bonnie Henry is director of Public Health Emergency Management at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. She's one of the point people on the H1N1 influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>Her book is both topical and practical. It provides in-depth insights into everything from H1N1 and hepatitis to West Nile Virus.</p>
<p>"Countless hours of misery are caused by bugs called viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites," she writes, (but) "much of this suffering is preventable."</p>
<p>The book's title is evidence of that fact. Henry is a strong advocate of the major benefits of washing hands well with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to prevent a multitude of diseases.</p>
<p>She cautions, however, against using soap or detergent with antibacterial agents because the antibacterial agents can lead to "antibiotic-resistant bugs, which can then cause hard-to-treat infections."</p>
<p>Indeed, this area embodies one of Henry's biggest concerns: "By taking unnecessary medications," she observes, "people have provided the bacteria in their bodies with a golden opportunity to determine the way the antibiotic works, thereby exerting selective pressure on bugs that can resist the drug."</p>
<p>Many of her recommendations are basic but bear repeating:</p>
<p>Cover your mouth when you cough, preferably with a tissue, and stay at home when you have a fever.</p>
<p>Get immunized.</p>
<p>Don't take antibiotics when you are sick with a virus (such as cold or flu).</p>
<p>Cook foods to a safe temperature, especially meat and seafood.</p>
<p>Wash foods thoroughly, especially produce that is eaten raw.</p>
<p>Clean cutting boards, counters, doorknobs, toys and all surfaces where bugs may linger.</p>
<p>Henry also tackles myths and truths about bugs using a comprehensive Top 10 list that includes such relevant facts as: "superbugs are helpless against good hygiene."</p>
<p>The breadth of information covered in the book is vast. Henry explores everything from dangers lurking in our food supply to those floating in hot tubs.</p>
<p>Her insider's perspective on the 2003 Toronto SARS virus outbreak makes for intriguing and sometimes alarming reading. "From the outset of the crisis," she notes, "public health officials and medical staff were frantically working blind."</p>
<p>Henry showcases her open-mindedness as an outstanding physician and scientist. In addition to delving into many of the major breakthroughs of modern medicine, she's also willing to pay tribute to double Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling's work with vitamin C.</p>
<p>While there's no scientific evidence to back it up, she says, "I personally would never underestimate the healing power of chicken soup to provide comfort and relieve suffering."</p>
<p>Thorough, useful and accessible, Soap and Water & Common Sense belongs on bookshelves and in doctors' offices everywhere.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada's top workers going for gold today; Record medal haul in reach</b>
</div><div>Valerie Berenyi   </div>

<div>599 words</div><div>6 September 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>All eyes are on the clock today as it ticks to 6 p. m.</p>
<p>That's when officials begin handing out the gold, silver and bronze medals for the 45 events at World-Skills Calgary 2009 during the closing ceremony at the Stampede Corral.</p>
<p>We won't know the winners until then, but Team Canada is hoping to meet or beat its best-ever results when it nabbed six medals two years ago at World-Skills in Shizuoka, Japan.</p>
<p>"As far as results go, we'll know at the same time as everybody else, but I'm confident we're going to do well," Team Canada leader Luc Morin said Saturday just before competition ended at 2 p. m. and the final judging began.</p>
<p>"We've seen very high morale here," Morin said of Canada's 38 team members who've been competing at Stampede Park for the past four days.</p>
<p>"Students are very excited, very confident and very comfortable with their work sites--not too many issues with equipment, tooling or needs like that."</p>
<p>"And there's some comfort coming because we are the host country. There's been lots of support from family, friends and students on the site," said Morin.</p>
<p>The Team Canada competitors who have consistently done well in daily results, scoring in the top five in their events, include Jonathan Arbour of Aubert-Gallion, Que., in Cabinetmaking; Marc-Olivier Belanger of Mirabel, Que., in Welding; Scott Blair of</p>
<p>Westport, Ont., in Carpentry; and Brian Everts of Maple Ridge, B. C., in Aircraft Mechanics.</p>
<p>Another one to watch is Dan Van Holst of Waterloo, Ont. He emerged in the top five in the Automobile Technology event Friday.</p>
<p>Morin cautions that doing well in daily results (which are not cumulative) won't necessarily result in a medal win.</p>
<p>This year, in an attempt to model itself after the Olympic Games and generate more public interest, WorldSkills International has pushed to have results reported daily. Not all 45 of the trades and occupations were able to do so, given the nature of their competitions.</p>
<p>Canadian competitors are trained not to be distracted by things like daily results and crowds of spectators-- "We've always used the catchphrase, 'Be in your bubble,'"--but the hot weather of the past week was challenging for some, especially those competing in tents outside, Morin said.</p>
<p>"It was a distraction, but I can say to the credit of WorldSkills Calgary that they made sure the students had enough water, provisions and fans on-site."</p>
<p>Team Canada took in stride the case of H1N1 flu that killed the stepfather of a Team New Zealand competitor Thursday, said Christianne Scholfield, a spokesperson for Skills Canada.</p>
<p>"Our sympathy goes out to the team from New Zealand, but it hasn't distracted our team. They're focused on the competition."</p>
<p>A total of 51 countries are vying for gold at the 40th WorldSkills competition.</p>
<p>Tickets to the closing ceremonies are sold out.</p>
<p>For medal results, go online to calgaryherald.comafter 8 p. m. tonight. A full list of winners will also appear in Monday's Herald.</p>

<p>Time for Liberals to show the beef,</p>
<p>Editorial, Sept. 3</p>
<p>This editorial sums up very well not only the position of the Star but also the electorate of this country.</p>
<p>While the role of the opposition is to keep the government of the day accountable, it also must present a clear and defined solution to the problems it states are endemic in government.</p>
<p>I have not seen anything remotely of this nature coming from the Liberal party. All we hear on a daily basis is political rhetoric. Bob Rae referred to the government as incompetent. If it is, show us why the Liberals won't be.</p>
<p>Finally, with the economy on the mend and a public health catastrophe on the horizon in the form of an H1N1 pandemic, the Liberals' zeal to force an election smacks of the vision of Nero fiddling as Rome burned.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Don't let flu fears curb your plans; H1N1 no reason to halt travels, officials say</b>
</div><div>Reb Stevenson </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>488 words</div><div>5 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>H1N1: When it broke back in April, I was in the eye of the storm. The centre of the burrito.</p>
<p>Mexico.</p>
<p>My group of Canadian travel journalists was calmly taken aside by a Mexican Tourist Board representative for a debriefing that began with something to the effect of: "Now don't freak out, but ... "</p>
<p>At that point, the severity of the virus hadn't hit home. A few days later, we connected through Mexico City's airport and the panic response kicked in. That's what happens when one in three people are wearing surgical masks and your breathing holes are naked.</p>
<p>Canadian customs in Toronto offered no solace: The masked agents looked equipped to languish in a mustard gas sauna.</p>
<p>During the two to seven-day incubation period that followed, like any normal individual, I convinced myself that I had swine flu.</p>
<p>Was my, um, particularly aqueous waste more than just an average Mexican souvenir? Was the minor tickle in my throat a sign to go coffin shopping -- or was it just a shard of popcorn I ate at the movie theatre (where I might have spread the pandemic to 50 innocent people)?</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had another encounter with H1N1's global impact. En route to Macedonia, H1N1 crossed my mind, so I washed my hands frequently and resolved not to make out with any strangers on the plane. (Believe me, it was challenging given the romantic mood set by a choir of screaming babies).</p>
<p>At Skopje's tiny airport, a crew of doctors in lab coats hastily put up signs instructing certain citizens -- including Canadians -- to pick up a piece of paper that ordered a checkup at a medical clinic.</p>
<p>Now, as fears mount about a possible second strain of the virus circulating this fall, people ask whether I'm going to curtail my travels. Or, at the very least, order a mask, gloves and coverall suit from www.fluarmour.com[http://www.fluarmour.com]. Maybe some disinfectant spray, too, to wield against sneezy foes.</p>
<p>The answer to all of the above is: no. As long as we're healthy, there's no reason to stop travelling until the government tells us to.</p>
<p>People already cough up (excuse the pun) so many excuses for not travelling: money, time, language barriers. Adding negative hype to that list only succeeds in wasting your opportunities to get out there and live. Just think about everyone who quaked in their slippers and stayed put for years post 9/11.</p>
<p>I hope to meet you on a flight in the near future. But, uh ... keep the handshake to yourself please.</p>

<p>When Shawn Atleo heads to his home community of Ahousaht this weekend, the Assembly of First Nations national chief will have a first-hand taste of a community on edge because of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>One case of H1N1 has been confirmed in Ahousaht and, although the infected person has recovered, community members believe it's possible others have been infected.</p>
<p>Ahousaht has responded exactly as governments and health authorities have recommended, with community meetings attended by up to 200 people, who were given information on prevention, treatment of symptoms and how to access the local supply of antivirals.</p>
<p>"We don't want fear, we want to educate community members," said Curtis Dick, deputy chief counsellor and emergency co-ordinator.</p>
<p>"We are as prepared as anyone. We are doing our best with the resources at hand and we have a pandemic plan in place," he said.</p>
<p>Atleo, while applauding the Ahousaht response, wants to see the issue of H1N1 in aboriginal communities spark an urgent look at broader issues on reserves.</p>
<p>"My concern, country-wide, is the relationship with Health Canada and health services generally," said Atleo, who wants federal acknowledgment that First Nations are a priority.</p>
<p>Reserves are vulnerable, not only because of the number of young people, but because of social conditions and the H1N1 pandemic should be an opportunity to close some of those gaps, Atleo said.</p>
<p>"It's linked to poverty, poor housing and the need for safe drinking water. We require a much more complete response," he said.</p>
<p>Good planning is taking place in many villages and B.C. First Nations communities are helped by the tripartite health agreement, which means all levels of government work together, but other provinces are not so lucky, Atleo said.</p>
<p>"It's time to close the jurisdictional gaps and stop the finger pointing," he said.</p>
<p>Some reserves in Manitoba are holding fundraisers to come up with enough money to buy supplies. Others cannot practice frequent hand-washing because they do not have running water and some remote villages have no health services within easy reach, Atleo said.</p>
<p>Infrastructure projects require funding and the H1N1 crisis should be used as an opportunity to get basic needs on a fast track, he said.</p>
<p>"We are also reaching out to the Canadian Red Cross and they have indicated they will work with us," Atleo said.</p>
<p>Another step, which Atleo wants to see, is a virtual national summit on H1N1, which should include all levels of government and experts from universities across the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Ahousaht, Dick is hoping residents have been reassured by the information they have been given.</p>
<p>"H1N1 is worldwide. You can't really escape it, it's how we handle it," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada to buy supply of special H1N1 vaccine for pregnant women</b>
</div><div>Helen Branswell </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Canada will purchase supplies of unadjuvanted H1N1 flu vaccine to offer to pregnant women who might otherwise choose not to be vaccinated, the country's chief public health officer has revealed.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said that Canada will buy 1.2 million doses of unadjuvanted pandemic vaccine which will be reserved for pregnant women, who are at significantly greater risk of becoming severely ill and dying if they contract the virus.</p>
<p>"I'm anticipating for pregnant women we will have an option," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The vaccine will be supplied by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, Canada's pandemic vaccine manufacturer, and is expected to be available at the same time as the country's other supplies of vaccine.</p>
<p>Adjuvants are compounds that boost the immune system's response to vaccine, allowing smaller doses to be used per person. Canada is buying adjuvanted pandemic vaccine partly in response to a call from the World Health Organization for affluent countries to use "antigen (vaccine) sparing" techniques so that limited global supplies can be stretched as far as possible.</p>
<p>While some European countries have used adjuvanted flu vaccines for a number of years, none of the currently licensed flu vaccines in Canada contains an adjuvant.</p>
<p>And there are no data on the use of adjuvanted flu vaccine in pregnant women - a fact that may add to the already high degree of reluctance many pregnant women feel about taking any medication or therapy.</p>
<p>"What is absolutely clear is that there is much more of a safety data base in pregnant woman with non-adjuvanted vaccine," said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, head of the World Health Organization's vaccine research initiative, the division overseeing pandemic vaccine issues.</p>
<p>"Does it mean that it (adjuvanted vaccine) will be unsafe? No. It means that there is no hard evidence that it will be (safe)."</p>
<p>The lack of evidence led a panel of experts that advises the WHO on vaccine issues to recommend unadjuvanted vaccine be offered to pregnant women if that option is available.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said some pregnant women may prefer an adjuvanted formulation, because it's likely to protect more broadly against mutated strains of the virus if and when they arise, and because it can be taken in smaller doses. Another plus, he said, is that one dose of adjuvanted vaccine might suffice, meaning pregnant women could be protected faster than if they had to get two doses of an unadjuvanted vaccine. (Doses for H1N1 flu vaccines are still being determined.)</p>
<p>But the decision to buy unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women - something the Public Health Agency of Canada had earlier said it would not do - reflects the very real fear of public health officials that pregnant women may shun this vaccine.</p>
<p>"I think that it is possible that a good chunk of the (pregnant) patients may just say: ‘You know what? No thanks.' And that's obviously a problem," said Dr. Richard Beigi, an academic obstetrician from Pittsburgh who recently published results of a survey suggesting few pregnant women would agree to take a pandemic flu shot.</p>
<p>"I think it is going to be challenging," Kris Sheedy, head of the H1N1 vaccine communications team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said of the effort to convince pregnant women they should get a pandemic flu shot.</p>
<p>It is well known that in previous pandemics pregnant women were the hardest hit group in terms of deaths. And this time, there have already been reports of miscarriages, emergency deliveries and deaths in pregnant women who caught H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are also at greater risk of complications from catching seasonal flu. Yet their willingness to be vaccinated against it remains low, despite government recommendations that they should get flu shots.</p>
<p>Sheedy said in the U.S., around 15 per cent of pregnant women get vaccinated most years. Dr. Jeff Kwong, a University of Toronto researcher who studies flu shot rates, said he doesn't know of a corresponding national figure for Canada. But a small study in Toronto during the 2003-04 flu season showed 14 per cent of women got a flu shot during their pregnancies.</p>
<p>Beigi's survey asked nearly 400 pregnant women if they would agree to be vaccinated with an avian influenza vaccine during a pandemic caused by that virus. The survey was conducted before H1N1 flu broke out and was done in the context of fears that the H5N1 virus - which kills roughly 60 per cent of the people who catch it - might cause the next pandemic.</p>
<p>Despite the high fatality rate of the H5 virus, only 15.4 per cent of the pregnant women surveyed said they'd take a shot if a bird flu pandemic erupted. And half the office staff of the obstetrical practices where the survey was conducted said they would not recommend the pregnant women in their care get pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>"I was relatively shocked at the responses," said Beigi, who teaches in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the <span class="companylink">University of Pittsburgh Medical Center</span>.</p>
<p>Sheedy said the Centers for Disease Control plans to work with obstetricians, hoping to persuade them to make the case for pandemic vaccination to their patients. Studies have shown, she said, that pregnant women value highly the advice they get from their obstetricians.</p>
<p>"I'm empathetic," she said, noting she has a two year old and a five year old, and remembers well the concerns of pregnancy.</p>
<p>"I understand that some (pregnant women) are going to choose not to vaccinate, but I do hope that if we're able to get information out there about what we're seeing with this virus and its impact on these women, that many of them will at least … consider it."</p>

</p>
<p>The prospect of a flu pandemic converging with a federal election will force politicians to sharpen their messages to preoccupied voters, observers say.</p>
<p>"They'll have to be much clearer in what they have to offer Canadians," said Michael Behiels, a political historian at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>With the Liberals serving notice of their intent to defeat the minority Harper government and the Conservatives girding themselves for a political battle, Canadians could go to the polls as early as October or November, around the start of the winter flu season. And if, as predicted, the country sees a resurgence of the H1N1 swine flu earlier than that, voters -- already struggling with a weak economy and facing their fourth federal election in five years -- could become too preoccupied to care about a campaign.</p>
<p>"It's fair to say that people will be even more inclined to not pay attention to politics," said Jonathan Malloy, a political scientist at Ottawa's Carleton University.</p>
<p>Pandemic planners assume that in a worst-case scenario, up to 30 per cent of Canadians could fall sick with the flu, grinding businesses to a halt and putting serious strain on hospitals, schools, government and families. Under such circumstances, political rallies would be sparsely attended and the number of voters at the polls would likely plummet.</p>
<p>"If it's serious enough, it might even affect when we have the voting day," said Nelson Wiseman, a political scientist at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>"If that happens, the election is the last thing people would start thinking about. And they would cut the government a lot of slack."</p>
<p>Alternatively, politicians on the hustings could find themselves defending or attacking any perceived mishandling of a pandemic, particularly if complications emerge around federal plans to vaccinate Canadians against the H1N1 virus. "The pressure is on them to respond," said Behiels. "And they'll have to respond to what's wrong with our health-care system that we can't deal with this generalized flu epidemic in a more systematic way."</p>
<p>Even so, few experts believe the major parties stand to score political points from making pandemic response an election issue.</p>
<p>"Any opposition party would be very wary of trying to make it an issue because it could backfire very easily," said Malloy. "The government could perhaps make it a bit of an issue, especially if the Liberals triggered an election, by saying, 'We wish we could work on this policy issue, but we've got to go out and run for our seats again, thanks to the Liberal party.' "</p>
<p>Nonetheless, experts agree the flu season likely will not be the deciding factor in whether the country goes to the polls.</p>
<p>"There's a much bigger self-interest calculation among all the parties and party leaders," said Malloy.</p>
<p>"All the parties are thinking of the larger issues, and I doubt that any one of them is really thinking too much about the flu."</p>

</div><div>Shelley Page </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>525 words</div><div>5 September 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>The public health department is hoping to convince 900,000 Ottawa residents to roll up their sleeves not once but three times this fall for flu shots -- including what's expected to be a double dose of H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>That's almost three million doses of vaccine that could potentially be distributed over the fall and winter months requiring a massive effort from health officials and also unprecedented co-operation from Ottawa residents, less than half of whom usually opt for the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>"We're aiming high," says Sherry Nigro, the manager responsible for pandemic planning at Ottawa Public Health.</p>
<p>She said in an interview Friday that the health department did not yet have an H1N1 vaccine plan to reveal to the public. However, the plan that is in the works will rely heavily on the infrastructure that is already in place to deliver the seasonal flu vaccine each year.</p>
<p>That means that family doctors will be the most likely source to receive the H1N1 flu vaccine, along with public health and workplace clinics.</p>
<p>It also means that seasonal flu vaccine clinics, run by the health department, will operate for only five weeks this year and be completed by Nov. 15, around the date it's expected the H1N1 vaccine will be ready for distribution.</p>
<p>Nigro said that Ottawa is waiting to reveal the details of the H1N1 plan because there are still many unknowns, including whether one injection or two are required to build up the necessary antibodies to fight the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>She also said it's not yet known whether certain groups should be vaccinated before others. If there are target groups, like children or pregnant women, requiring the vaccine first, these scenarios will require a different distribution system than if mass immunization of the entire population is recommended.</p>
<p>She stressed that the H1N1 vaccine, like the seasonal flu vaccine, is not mandatory.</p>
<p>And she also acknowledged it will take a huge media campaign to inform people of the reasons receiving a vaccination is important.</p>
<p>"When we do get the final directives, we'll have a major campaign to make people aware of what their options are," Nigro says.</p>
<p>"It's up to people to make their own decisions."</p>
<p>She said there are many consultations going on and the public health department is developing "various scenarios."</p>
<p>"It's all in play," Nigro says.</p>
<p>At a press conference Friday, Nigro and other public health officials stressed the importance of being vaccinated not only against H1N1 but also against the seasonal flu. They also said that the elderly and those with underlying health conditions should receive the pneumococcal vaccine, which prevents pneumonia.</p>
<p>By getting vaccinated against seasonal flu, and receiving the pneumococcal vaccine, it will help reduce the severity of illness in some people who get H1N1 and also reduce the burden on the health-care system that is confronted with the unknowns of H1N1.</p>
<p>"We want to build as much immunity in the community as we can," Nigro says.</p>

</p>
<p>The last Haida left the village of K'uuna Llnagaay, or Skedans, off the north coast of British Columbia, almost a century ago – long enough even for cedar to crumble back into soil.</p>
<p>The house timbers were all gone years ago; the frontal and mortuary poles are all that remain of human handiwork – but even these lie at increasingly acute angles. Soon the forest will take them back. The stylized orca and thunderbird representations gazing out at the sea are bearded with moss. The poles themselves have been reduced to a crust of grey carved cedar around a core of disintegrating rot.</p>
<p>K'uuna Llnagaay was 26 houses, about 500 people, until the smallpox epidemics began in 1862. After these reduced the Haida by more than 95 per cent throughout the Haida Gwaii archipelago (now also called the Queen Charlotte Islands), the remnant population of just 558 gradually abandoned the coastal villages. The northern villages coalesced mostly into Masset, the southern ones into Skidegate, both on Graham Island.</p>
<p>This is where most of the Haida lived when the next viral cataclysm struck them – the influenza of 1918, which laid waste to their settlements and left many islands permanently uninhabited. The effect of the Spanish flu on the indigenous peoples of the planet is one of the underappreciated details of its cruelty. No one who witnessed the devastation wrought upon the Haida then would have been surprised this year, when the first ripples of the current influenza pandemic showed up in Canada, that native communities were hit first and hardest.</p>
<p>Now, the whole country is bracing for autumn, colder weather and the re-opening of schools. The portents seem clear: The average death toll of influenza, about 4,000 Canadians annually, will be exceeded significantly. In hospitals, Tamiflu is locked up with the narcotics, to remove any temptation. This year's influenza vaccine is the most anticipated ever, as the Canadian Medical Association showed this week by calling for a speed-up in the review process to get it to high-risk populations.</p>
<p>In 1918, the tolls were worst in remote regions; among American Indians, 8.5 per cent died – but in Nome, Alaska, 55 per cent of the Inuit were killed. It was comparable among the Alaskan Haida and Tinglit: In fishing village Micknick, 42 of the 50 residents were killed. The Canadian Haida died similarly.</p>
<p>On the same latitude, but 3,000 miles to the east, in Hebron, Labrador, 150 out of 220 Innu were killed. This against a world-wide case-fatality rate of 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p>That year's influenza was extraordinary in several ways beyond its lethality: It affected the young and the healthy disproportionately; it also spread readily beyond the lungs to injure the brain, the kidneys and the heart.</p>
<p>But in its appetite for indigenous peoples, the Great Flu was drearily typical. Tuberculosis, HIV, measles, E. coli – all the important pathogens claim Inuit and first-nations people at rates many multiples of what is seen in cities. This was the case at the outset, with initial exposure to European infections, and it remains so half-a-millennium later – the T.B. infection rate on reserves in 2004 was 20.9 per 100,000; the national rate was 1.6.</p>
<p>When the discipline of public health first arose, and directed its attention to the death rates on the reserves, much was made of indigenous peoples' innate vulnerability to introduced infections such as influenza, presumably on a genetic basis, presumably as a consequence of different – the subtext here is apparent – evolutionary pressures.</p>
<p>In the popular discourse this susceptibility continues to be emphasized. Given the calamitous 500-year history of infections and aboriginals, it is easy to understand how such an idea might gain traction, but the truth is more complex and difficult.</p>
<p>There are differences in immunity between various racial groups – the Inuit, for instance, may suffer more middle-ear infections than other populations, partly because of differences in inflammatory responses; African Americans seem to suffer fewer, for reasons less well-explained.</p>
<p>But the main reason native people die of infections, at rates that would be inconceivable and entirely unacceptable to other Canadians, is because they are poor. The poor die of everything – heart attacks, diabetes, suicides, homicides, drowning, house fires – at rates that would not be permitted along the various Bridle Paths of the nation.</p>
<p>In 1918 the Haida lived on the verge of malnutrition, in crowded, smoky houses without running water, resident physician services or adequate sewage. Ninety-one years later, this June, H1N1 influenza hit Canada the deepest on the Cree reserve of St. Theresa Point in Manitoba – for precisely the same reasons: crowding, malnutrition, poverty and indifference.</p>
<p>Which would be lethal enough without any genetic differences in immune response. But just to make matters worse, they exist.</p>
<p>“A hundred years ago, the pendulum was all the way to the side of genetics,” says Dr. Pamela Orr, of the University of Manitoba's departments of community medicine and infectious diseases. “Then the thinking shifted and it was realized just how important the extreme poverty of northern reserves is. And now we still think that's important, but there's probably also an important difference in immune response.</p>
<p>“This means that health-care interventions need to be more aggressively and more precisely tailored to the needs of First Nations populations. It means that the deprivation is even more disastrous.”</p>
<p>Fifty of the 2,000 residents of Saint Theresa Point required evacuation to Winnipeg hospitals this summer for H1N1; over the course of the Manitoba-wide outbreak, seven died. The majority of other Manitobans requiring intensive-care-unit admission for H1N1 were of native descent. The average age of those requiring hospital evacuation was an incredibly youthful 35.</p>
<p>Forty million people were killed worldwide by the last great pandemic. This is the first pandemic of any size at all in 41 years. How could it not be catastrophic?</p>
<p>A catastrophe exists already, and will manifest itself further and with great predictability in Pukatawagan and Sioux Look-</p>
<p>out and Shamatawa and Arviat and Hobema and Hazelton and Masset and Kasheshewan and Davis Inlet in a few months, when influenza fully comes ashore.</p>
<p>A pathogenic pas de trois</p>
<p>Epidemics unfold as a kind of pas de trois between pathogen, host and the environment they unfold in. Everything about them depends on that interaction. With flu, the pathogen's nature and virulence vary a little each year; 31 times in the last 400 years – and now 32 – it has abruptly worsened.</p>
<p>At the same time, the host's behaviour and the circumstances under which he or she (or, in the case of animals, it) lives strongly influence the course of an epidemic, especially through the number of other hosts typically infects – this is termed the Ro, or the reproductive number.</p>
<p>The 1918 strain's Ro was 3, meaning each infected person infected an average of three others; thus far, the 2009 strain's has ranged from as low as 1.4 (based on the Mexican experience) to as high as 4.28, in an outbreak at the St. Francis parochial school in New York. Among populations where people are packed together, as in classrooms, the Ro will reliably increase.</p>
<p>Add in residential crowding and limited sanitation and that number inches higher.</p>
<p>Conversely, and ironically, nomadic hunter-gatherers living traditionally suffer no epidemics at all: Density is dangerous in infection, as in war. The infantry motto “don't bunch up” can be applied usefully to all sorts of attacks.</p>
<p>The Ro influences the attack rate, which is a little more intuitive and useful in estimating the scope of the problem. This is the expected portion of the population who will be afflicted in the course of the pandemic. The usual attack rate in pandemic influenza ranges between 25 and 40 per cent. In New Zealand, where the winter flu season has already begun, the data suggest a Ro of 1.96, which corroborate Japanese estimates.</p>
<p>The secondary attack rate – that is, the likelihood that any given close contact of an infected person will get the virus – ranges between 12 and 18 per cent. Multiple contacts may drive the final attack rate much higher than that, and usually do in pandemics, which is both cause and consequence of their severity.</p>
<p>The ultimate significance of the likelihood of infection is determined by the case-fatality rate (CFR): Most years less than 0.1 per cent of people infected with influenza die as a consequence of that infection. The data out of Australia suggest a CFR between 0.14 and 1.4 per cent for the H1N1, though this can change over time and between different populations.</p>
<p>The process of mutation that gives rise to pandemics in the first place does not cease with their inception, and there is nothing to say that the virus's nature will remain constant. This is the source of considerable anxiety with respect to the current outbreak – like last spring's, the initial waves of the 1918 epidemic were mild, but grew in virulence and lethality with each resurgence.</p>
<p>The rate at which an epidemic spreads is referred to as generation time; with a generation time of two to three days, H1N1 is capable of doubling the number of affected cases every 72 hours. A similarly brief generation time in 1918 caused stories such as whole crews of miners in Spitzbergen abruptly falling ill at once and dying within hours, like H.G. Wells' Martian invaders. One may imagine the impression such events left on the public consciousness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for those who live in expansive apartments with gleaming kitchens, the current pandemic will inevitably be a much different experience than 1918. This has less to do with advances in medical care (Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 strains have already emerged) than with what we can anticipate the Ro will be, as a consequence of wealth and the epidemiologic features of wealthy societies – small families, low burden of chronic illness, uncrowded classrooms, sick time.</p>
<p>The reproductive number may be influenced further by public-health measures that discourage the ill – especially health-care workers – from going to work or out in public. Together these may explain the relatively low mortality seen in Australia in the current southern-hemisphere winter, hopefully presaging what will be seen to the north.</p>
<p>The most effective vaccine against any infection is affluence. In this respect, southern and, especially, urban Canadians are among the most thoroughly inoculated anywhere. But the importance of the huge disparities in affluence – between the races, between the north and the south, between rural and urban communities – becomes not merely a matter of fairness but one of life and death when epidemic disease appears.</p>
<p>The relationship between health and wealth has been clear since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; it was aptly demonstrated by tuberculosis. In 1828 the death rate from TB in Britain was 4,000 per million – at a time when the death rate from all causes was 9,000 per million. By 1948, immediately prior to the discovery of the antibiotic streptomycin, it had fallen to 400 per million.</p>
<p>The difference in the intervening 120 years did not lie in medical care. TB specialists spent that century pursuing a range of violent treatments – repetitively collapsing consumptives' lungs, even filling chest cavities with foreign objects to keep them collapsed; hydrotherapy, spa stays, everything new was old again then and the advocates of those treatments might as well have been peddling megavitamins and aura manipulation.</p>
<p>What did change was affluence. Britain began to know sustained growth in GDP per capita and with it, tuberculosis death rates sank. When, in their turn, the countries of the European continent began to experience the same economic trends, the same thing happened to their TB death rates, eventually falling, as Britain's did, 90 per cent, even prior to the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy.</p>
<p>As autumn looms and anxiety about H1N1 mounts, the most useful responses will revolve around maximizing just those advantages made possible by being wealthy and educated – keeping personal contact between the sick and the well to a minimum, emphasizing hand-washing and hygiene generally, and getting people vaccinated.</p>
<p>The case-fatality rate still may be much higher than what is usual for seasonal influenza, but will likely be within the range of what was known with the Asian, Hong Kong, and Fujiian strains of the last decades. This will not collapse the health-care system, much less society itself. No one has to stockpile ammunition.</p>
<p>Straining the cities' webs</p>
<p>And yet it will likely be bad.</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, the demands placed on the city's ICUs by people who came there from Saint Theresa Point during its outbreak, together with a smaller simultaneous outbreak in the city itself, nearly overwhelmed that city's critical-care community. Intensive-care physicians and nurses and respiratory technicians were stretched nearly to the breaking point by a weekly doubling of H1N1 cases over the course of two months.</p>
<p>Saint Theresa Point is 2,000 people – one-five-hundredth of Manitoba's population – and it generated enough critically ill people nearly to swamp the province's critical-care capacity.</p>
<p>The SARS outbreak in Toronto is still a fresh memory for the critical-care community there, and by every estimate, the numbers of critically ill and dying patients that may be anticipated this autumn and winter will exceed the numbers that generated those crises by many orders of magnitude. Overall, there isn't enough ICU capacity in the country to begin to treat the numbers sickened by the great pandemics of the past.</p>
<p>H1N1's predilection for the young bodes ominously, too. Forty-one per cent of U.S. deaths from H1N1 have occurred in the 25-49 age group. The death rate among the Haida and Tinglit in 1918 was so high not solely because of the direct effects of the influenza, but also because the young adults who did the fishing and the hunting and the food preparation were incapacitated. Villages simply starved to death, to the last soul, even though many inhabitants survived the actual pandemic.</p>
<p>Modern cities are even more interdependent, their citizens' skills more specialized and the citizens themselves less self-sufficient. Even if the CFR is within the Australian estimates – up to 10 times the norm – if this is coupled with a high attack rate and a shift of the affected to the young from the elderly and infirm, then the functioning of police services, transportation, utilities and trade throughout cities will be seriously affected.</p>
<p>Dr Bruce Martin, associate dean of the University of Manitoba and director of that institution's Northern Medical Unit, was one of the team that flew to Saint Theresa Point to direct community care. “Just keeping the building open under that kind of work load is incredibly difficult,” he says.</p>
<p>“As bad as the outbreak was, and as sick as the many of the ill were, there is another huge body of people who are less sick, who don't require evacuation, but do need to be assessed and reassured. And then sent home, to stay home, until they are better. Keeping any of the community's basic services working in that situation is very difficult.”</p>
<p>The isolation measures made necessary by an outbreak of such severity will prove just as draconian to interdependent urbanites. SARS infected only 251 in the Greater Toronto Area, yet it collapsed the municipal economy for three months. An influenza attack rate of 30 per cent will affect 1.5 million Torontonians. If the CFR is as high as 0.5 per cent, then 7,000 of those may perish. SARS killed just 43.</p>
<p>A severe epidemic demonstrates the interdependence of humans with unusual concision. Picture a city bedbound by the flu: The image is one of empty markets, neglected shut-ins and unrepaired sewer lines. Humans are communal animals as much as bees or ants. A threat to any is a threat to all from every perspective: epidemiological, civic and moral.</p>
<p>Which is why the desperation of the reservations really is everyone's problem.</p>
<p>Eventually, a pandemic response strategy tailored to the particular challenges faced by first-nations people will be created, if not for this pandemic, then for the next. Hopefully it will be part of a more meaningful strategy to level out the burden of illness known by first-nations people, especially diabetes, which threatens to become a slower-moving smallpox among the people of the boreal forest.</p>
<p>In the meantime, everything I've said concerning the impact influenza will have on cities will play itself out on the reserves this winter, but worse many times over. The Saint Theresa Point experience will be re-enacted so regularly that eventually only the local media will bother even to mention it. However, suffering itself does not localize. It flies around in aircraft and takes over the ICUs and it comes to the Bridle Paths and it affects 1.9 to 2.2 other people, on average, within 2.1 to 3.0 days.</p>
<p>It will begin among the most vulnerable – and it is in the nature of that particular vulnerability that it will encompass us all.</p>

</p>
<p>Re: What's safer: H1N1 flu or vaccine? (Letter, Sept. 2)</p>
<p>For at least 15 years, I have had annual vaccinations against seasonal influenza. During that time, I have had no side-effects and no flu.</p>
<p>However, I am having a great deal of difficulty believing that the pharmaceutical companies developing the H1N1 vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline in Canada) have our best interests at heart. The reason for my skepticism is the addition of an adjuvant, squalene (HSO3), to the vaccine itself.</p>
<p>Squalene is an oil-water molecule with a twofold purpose -- to enhance the immunity provided by the vaccine in the body, and thus to make "dose sparing" possible. In other words, less vaccine per person means more people can be vaccinated worldwide. Sound altruistic?</p>
<p>Squalene occurs naturally in the body. It is essential to us in our diet. But when it is injected, it can turn the body's immune system against itself. Squalene was used as an adjuvant in the anthrax vaccines given to all Gulf War personnel before deployment to the Persian Gulf. Subsequently, an alarming percentage of vaccine recipients have been diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome which includes a broad range of auto-immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and ALS.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies will be monitoring side-effects of H1N1 test subjects for several weeks before giving the go-ahead for mass vaccination this fall, beginning, we are told, with health care workers, children and those with compromised immune systems. Unfortunately, auto-immune diseases do not manifest themselves in a matter of days or weeks. An aging population is already challenging our medical system. Imagine the demands on it if, several years down the road, we discover that we have created a huge surge in the incidence of auto-immune diseases.</p>
<p>Fortunately, seasonal flu vaccines have not been adjuvanted. Apparently, the Canadian H1N1 vaccine is being manufactured separately from the adjuvant, squalene. However, the plan is that the two will simply be combined at the time of vaccination. It seems to me that we need some reassurance about the safety of the adjuvant, squalene, before fall.</p>

<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>Alberta health officials told tens of thousands of young people that it was safe to attend an international trades competition after the stepfather of a participant died of swine flu.</p>
<p>Parts of the sprawling World Skills competition grounds have been cleaned after the relative of one of the New Zealand competitors died Thursday in a Calgary hospital, said chair Guy Mallabone.</p>
<p>More than 900 competitors from 49 countries are in Calgary for the Olympic-style competition aimed at drawing attention to careers in the trades and technology sectors. About 50,000 students are registered to attend. The event, for competitors under 25, will continue as planned, Mallabone said.</p>
<p>"We're aware of no other individuals that have demonstrated symptoms for flu," he said.</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical health officer said the man was probably infected in his homeland, where flu season is well underway.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau said it appears to be an isolated case of the illness and the man's family has not shown any flu symptoms.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nurses brace for surge of H1N1; Some reminded of anger, pain left by SARS</b>
</div><div>Sheryl Ubelacker  </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>795 words</div><div>5 September 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>With fears that Canada could be hit by a massive wave of H1N1 influenza cases this fall, nurses across the country are preparing to take their places on the front lines of the pandemic -- and bracing for the worst.</p>
<p>For months, provincial and territorial nurses groups have been engaged in pandemic planning with hospitals and government, while readying their members for a possible onslaught of cases that could swamp the system.</p>
<p>One of the greatest concerns is that there simply will not be enough nurses to handle a sustained influx of patients, especially those admitted with life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>While most cases of H1N1 so far have caused only mild symptoms, a proportion of those infected have become seriously ill, ending up in intensive care units on ventilators, often for weeks.</p>
<p>"If I was to look at the biggest threat, I think it's the lack of us having the capacity for the surge or the need for RNs on the front lines," says Linda Haslam-Stroud, president of the Ontario Nurses' Association and a renal transplant nurse with St. Joseph's Healthcare in Hamilton.</p>
<p>There is already a shortage of nurses in the health-care system, she says. If swine flu does hit with a vengeance, it's likely some health-care workers will be among those who contract the infection.</p>
<p>"So we're in a situation where these nurses are not going to have enough colleagues to care for patients."</p>
<p>Sandi Mowat, president of the Manitoba Nurses Union, says Winnipeg hospitals have already experienced a flood of swine flu patients needing specialized treatment.</p>
<p>In June, the virus swept through several northeastern aboriginal communities, leaving a trail of infectious destruction that saw dozens of patients airlifted to three Winnipeg hospitals.</p>
<p>"Our ICU bed counts were at a maximum.... And the end result was we didn't have nursing staff for those beds," says Mowat, adding that hospitals had to transfer RNs with previous ICU experience from other departments to help ease the shortfall.</p>
<p>Beyond adequate staffing levels, nurses are adamant that their working environments be as safe as possible -- with protective gear like properly fitted N95 respirator masks -- and that they be kept informed by daily communication with hospital administrators.</p>
<p>They don't want a repeat of what happened during the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed 44 people in the Toronto area.</p>
<p>"SARS is still in the forefront of the nurses' minds across Ontario, obviously," says Haslam-Stroud. "Although it might seem like a long time ago to the public, it isn't a long time ago to the nurses who were in the trenches. We had two of our nurses die of SARS.</p>
<p>"I think the difference now is that nurses are very clear in saying they want to be on the front lines -- that's what they're trained to do -- but they are not willing to put themselves at risk like they did during SARS."</p>
<p>Among them is Kim Campbell, who contracted SARS during a second wave of the epidemic that struck Toronto's North York General Hospital after the province prematurely declared the threat had been contained.</p>
<p>Like other nurses stricken by severe acute respiratory syndrome, Campbell is still dealing with the physical and cognitive scars left by the disease, which put her in hospital for a week and required lengthy rehabilitation.</p>
<p>While back to full-time hours now, the mother of three continues to experience fatigue, has painful joints and becomes short of breath easily. Her memory has also been impaired.</p>
<p>The emergence of the H1N1 flu strain in April rekindled the anger and fear she felt over SARS and thought she had put behind her.</p>
<p>"I went to my boss and I said, 'I just want to tell you if it gets worse, if it gets to the point where we're masked and gowned, I can't do it.' ... I just said to her I can't work.</p>
<p>"And I was almost crying because I thought, 'I cannot put myself and my family through that again.'"</p>
<p>Haslam-Stroud says nurses have more trust in government and their hospital employers because there's clearly been an emphasis on pandemic planning -- a lesson driven home by SARS.</p>
<p>"But they know that it's still not enough, so they're going to be very wary and they're going to ask a lot of questions and they're going to be proactive where maybe we weren't that way previously."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No worries at zoo with meerkats; Lovable mammals worm their way into the hearts of visitors</b>

<div>Special To The Journal</div>
<div>1070 words</div><div>5 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>J1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>It took until the second visit, but we finally met a gang worth writing home about -- the beloved Melbourne meerkats.</p>
<p>Sarah, my girlfriend, and I returned to the Melbourne Zoo a few days after our first visit upon seeing an advertised unique "photo experience" with the little creatures.</p>
<p>Who wouldn't spend $29 for a few minutes with the African animals, propelled to fame in the recent documentary series Meerkat Manor.</p>
<p>We took the tram into the city under Melbourne's grey winter skies. Picked up from the middle of the road, the tram then cut through Royal Park, taking us on brief but greeny tour. We soon jumped off and with big smiles announced our intentions.</p>
<p>"We're here to see the meerkats!" we told the cashier, handing him our ticket for the 11:30 a.m. photo experience.</p>
<p>We had some time to kill, so we settled in for a spot on a park bench. It took everything in us to not chuckle when a few other tourists passed by wearing medical masks. Perhaps they were scared the meerkats had swine flu?</p>
<p>The zoo photographer joined us and a mum with her two kids -- growing ever more impatient as they waited. I asked the photographer what was the most popular photo experience.</p>
<p>Sure, you could book a typical Aussie tourism photo with a kangaroo or even hug a koala, but it seemed the meerkat exhibit was always their busiest, she said.</p>
<p>I figured it has to do with the Australian mateship they display. In a gang of 15 to 20, meerkats are intensely loyal and value their friendships.</p>
<p>There's always one of them standing tall on the lookout, scanning the skies for enemies and yelping out one of 20 possible calls when trouble arrives--all taking turns in this important duty.</p>
<p>That, and they're so adorable, like tiny, cuddly teddy bears. (They even have little beady brown eyes.)</p>
<p>The zookeeper arrived a few minutes late with a bucket half-full of live mealworms. Our hearts sank a bit when she said we weren't allowed to pet the meerkats as they can find it quite threatening.</p>
<p>We were led in behind their enclosure and, like excited pet dogs, the meerkats were already poking their noses at the door trying to be the first to see us and--more than likely--the first to be fed.</p>
<p>We let the mum and her children go first, and in return she gave us a line to dazzle our friends with.</p>
<p>"It's like lollies for them," she said of the worms, laughing as the meerkats scurried around her children while we watched eagerly from a distance.</p>
<p>It was then our turn and we tiptoed past the meerkat mound of sandy tunnels and plunked ourselves down on a wooden bench. Other tourists pointed at us as the zookeeper placed a handful of sticky worms in our palms.</p>
<p>We were quickly swarmed by the meerkat gang. They crawled all over our thighs and their little paws had long black claws that dig curiously at our fingers.</p>
<p>No man could keep a straight face in such a scenario.</p>
<p>This was a crew that would snap up every last wriggly worm, using their noses to sniff out every hiding place and tickling you in the process.</p>
<p>The photographer clicked away at our glee as the wormy feast caused the meerkats to tumble and grunt around us. Their soft speckled fur rubbed up against our jackets and an odd musky smell drifted through the air.</p>
<p>One excited meerkat then dove headfirst between our legs, its stubby tail furiously vibrating as it found a rouge worm on the bench. He slurped it back and then looked at me like it wanted one more.</p>
<p>We tried to stall the zookeeper so we could stay a bit longer by asking her plenty of questions, but she seemed intent on keeping things on schedule.</p>
<p>We did find out that meerkats are very curious mammals and the zookeeper often hid the worms in toys or in nearby logs so they run back and forth looking for them.</p>
<p>"Anything that's new they want to know about," she said.</p>
<p>We listened to the zookeeper's short talk afterwards about their lifestyle. Did you know that in each gang of meerkats, there is only one female who is allowed to breed and others will be punished by the group if they do?</p>
<p>On our way out we headed through the zoo gift shop but didn't find the one expected meerkat gift: a copy of the The Lion King song Hakuna Matata. Timon, the animated meerkat voiced by actor Nathan Lane, had belted out that tune in the classic <span class="companylink">Disney</span> movie and taught us years ago that it meant "no worries."</p>
<p>It hadn't dawned on us until then that the meerkat song is therefore an unofficial Australian anthem, meaning these furry critters could really be mates.</p>
<p>The meerkat experience runs daily at 11:30 a.m. You can also check out the zoo's other animal experiences online at www.zoo.org.au[http://www.zoo.org.au].</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1: Let's talk about pig farms</b>
</div><div>Kate Heartfield   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>727 words</div><div>5 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada recommendations for some people in high-risk groups during the H1N1 pandemic include the advice to consider avoiding crowds. Pigs are getting no such advice.</p>
<p>It's striking that public-health authorities, in Canada and elsewhere, are saying so little -- at least in public -- about the crowded conditions on factory farms around the world.</p>
<p>"It's really clear that this virus comes from the swine lineage," says Earl Brown, executive director of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa. "There are big questions about farming practices that nobody wants to talk about."</p>
<p>I should stress, from the beginning, that nobody seems to know yet exactly how this particular strain of flu evolved from its predecessors and showed up in the human population in Mexico. There is no evidence that it came directly from a pig farm. What we do know, however, is that the virus is related to a family of flu viruses that did emerge on North American pig farms in the 1990s. And we know this virus contains elements of pig, bird and human flu, and this summer there have been some indications that it is able to jump back and forth between those three populations.</p>
<p>We also know that, as Brown puts it, "high-density farming leads to high virulence." When you put a lot of pigs together in a confined space, you make a virus very happy.</p>
<p>There's no reason to suspect that pig farming is currently contributing to the spread of this pandemic (and, needless to say, there's no danger of contracting the flu from eating pork). But there is reason to suspect that farming practices shape the way flu viruses evolve.</p>
<p>Last year, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, in the United States, issued a report called Putting Meat on the Table: Industrial Farm Animal Production in America. One of the areas it examined was the potential impact of big pig farms on public health.</p>
<p>"The potential for pathogen transfer from animals to humans is increased in industrial farm animal production because so many animals are raised together in confined areas," the report said. "Fifty years ago, a U.S. farmer who raised pigs or chickens might be exposed to several dozen animals for less than an hour a day. Today's confinement facility worker is often exposed to thousands of pigs or tens of thousands of chickens for eight or more hours each day."</p>
<p>When pigs and humans do share the same strain of flu -- as they seem to with this pandemic strain of H1N1 -- what happens on industrial pig farms is of direct concern to human beings, those who eat pork and those who don't. "There's a recognition at high levels that veterinary health and human health have to be considered as one discipline, especially when it comes to protecting public health," says Brown.</p>
<p>But the public isn't really getting that message. When I asked the Public Health Agency of Canada about possible connections between pig farms and the H1N1 pandemic, I was directed to the Canada Food Inspection Agency. As far as public-message creation goes, what happens on farms is an agricultural issue, not a public-health issue.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of that is because of the thin skins of big pork producers. We're not even supposed to say "swine flu" any more, lest the industry get offended. The thing is, the industry needs to be part of this conversation, as do consumers, politicians and public-health officials. As Brown emphasizes, it isn't very helpful to self-righteously criticize the big bad agriculture industry for raising pigs in a way that maximizes profit. Consumers like paying low prices for meat. If they want pigs to be raised on less crowded farms, with fewer opportunities for the spread of new strains of flu, consumers will have to insist on that and be willing to pay more.</p>
<p>But first, consumers have to be aware that there are risk factors associated with large, dense pig farms. That means that politicians and public-health officials have to get over this bizarre form of political correctness that has made any questioning of industrial agriculture strictly taboo.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The ethics of vaccination; Basic principles must be kept in mind in any mass vaccination program</b>
</div><div>Jaro Kotalik   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>1476 words</div><div>5 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>It was in the fall of 1976. Spurred by the discovery of a novel swine flu virus among sick recruits in a military camp and the prediction that this virus would lead to a pandemic, the U.S. government ordered a national vaccination campaign. It was an administrative success with 48 million Americans getting vaccinated in less than three months.</p>
<p>However, records show that only one person actually had died of this virus and the anticipated pandemic never materialized. In addition, the vaccine was blamed for producing hundreds of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a debilitating and otherwise rare neurological condition. The vaccination campaign was abruptly stopped after 25 people died of paralysis and respiratory failure.</p>
<p>The present scenario in the fall of 2009 is different from that of 1976. This swine flu virus has already caused a pandemic with more than 70 deaths in Canada and thousands of deaths around the world. Under these circumstances, a national vaccination campaign makes eminent sense and the federal government and its experts are to be congratulated for their foresight and efforts in securing an in-Canada vaccine production facility to meet national demand. However, if anything is to be learned from the 1976 "swine flu fiasco," it is that such a campaign has many scientific, social and ethical aspects that require careful consideration.</p>
<p>Ethically speaking, a mass vaccination program should be guided at minimum by three basic ethical principles, namely, beneficence, respect for autonomy, and justice. In applying the principle of beneficence, the program's goal ought to achieve a net benefit to the population, taking into account prevention of deaths and illnesses, as well as burdens and risks. By and large, routinely used vaccines, perfected over the years are safe and effective. But such assurance for the new pandemic vaccine must wait until it is fully tested, including clinical trials with volunteers. These tests have been scheduled, but the temptation is to do trials rapidly.</p>
<p>The longer the trials and the more volunteers involved, the more reliably can a vaccine's safety and efficacy be determined, since some side effects can appear long after the injection. On the other hand, the sooner a safe vaccine is licensed for use, the more people can be protected.</p>
<p>We are told that trials will be done by November and vaccination across the country will start in December. Delays in scheduling require patience. Health authorities have the responsibility to assure themselves that the vaccine is reasonably effective and safe before asking millions of people to accept it. Safety is particularly important because the new vaccine will be offered to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, persons with chronic illnesses, and children.</p>
<p>The program also ought to be guided by the second ethical principle, the principle of respect for autonomy, which would enable people to make their own decisions about whether or not to accept vaccination, regardless of how strongly the health authorities feel about the usefulness and safety of the vaccine. Respect for persons and their intrinsic dignity, requires no less.</p>
<p>In this regard, vaccination during a flu pandemic should not be different from any other medical procedure, which requires of the participant a voluntary informed consent. In order for the consent process to be informed, candidates for vaccination will need to be given estimates of anticipated benefits and foreseeable risks. A blanket reassurance such as, "trust me, it is good for you," is not acceptable; people must be given the facts and figures acquired from new clinical trials and past historical experiences, and their questions should be responsibly answered.</p>
<p>Professionals responsible for vaccination need to ensure that participants understand the information. For example, vaccinated people may erroneously believe that a vaccine provides 100 per cent protection, while 60 to 80 per cent protection would be a more realistic expectation. If people sign the consent form with an incorrect impression, they may become careless and not take the usual precautions against infecting themselves or others.</p>
<p>Hopefully, somewhere there is a group of experts that is already composing a consent form that includes all relevant information that can assist people in making a decision about getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>In applying the third ethical principle, the principle of justice, the vaccination program must focus on a just and fair distribution and administering system. The federal decision to offer the vaccine to every Canadian has reduced concerns about unjust distribution. However, because the whole population cannot be vaccinated at once, the pandemic planners have established a needs-based distribution scheme by dividing the population into groups defined by occupation, level of risk, and age. To date, there is no federal-level recommendation about which of these subgroups will receive the vaccination first.</p>
<p>To determine priority group distribution, many factors will have to be considered; however, it is important that the responsible authorities arrive at their decision in a very public, transparent and justified manner. Yet, creating appropriate groups and order of priority does not guarantee that justice is fully served.</p>
<p>It is also important that the method of delivery is just and fair. If, for example, persons with a high risk of complication from influenza are given priority for vaccination, it is necessary to identify them by name, based on their actual health condition, and they must be notified about the vaccination offer. Some will be in institutions, many in their homes, and some will lack the ability to go to vaccination clinics. Will home-care agencies have the responsibility to contact these people and bring vaccination to their homes?</p>
<p>Vaccine administration will be further complicated when trying to administer to those with communication challenges or disabilities, and by individuals or groups who may try to gain an unfair advantage. Do we have enough people in the health-care system who are designated for this task and getting ready to carry it out?</p>
<p>One group which justifiably may be given priority vaccination is front-line health care workers, but this will not be free of ethical problems. For example, if a health-care worker receives priority vaccination, it would seem to create a reciprocal ethical obligation to serve.</p>
<p>How should we respond, if at the height of the pandemic such a person is unwilling to work? Even more problematic is the scenario where a physician or nurse refuses the pandemic vaccination. This is not an unlikely scenario, because more than 50 per cent of these professionals refuse the yearly flu vaccination which is highly recommended and promoted.</p>
<p>For health-care workers, the decision to vaccinate is not just a personal decision. They are offered the vaccine not only to diminish their chance of disease and death, but also to maintain their health in order that they are available to serve. Even more importantly, vaccination will reduce the risk that of their transferring the virus from patients with the flu to patients that have other health problems. Unvaccinated health care workers at the height of a pandemic would likely put their patients at risk -- an ethically most problematic situation.</p>
<p>Legal enforcement of vaccination is the last measure to consider. The first step is for all colleges of health-care professions to consider if the acceptance of vaccination should or should not be declared an ethical obligation of the professionals they oversee.</p>
<p>Another important, justice-related issue is to consider offering compensation to people who are injured by vaccination. Even if the vaccine is reasonably safe, there is the possibility that of the many millions who receive it, some will experience adverse effects which at times can be debilitating. Is it fair that such people be burdened by both a personal injury and the economic consequences of such an event? Would it not be a further unfair burden, if a justified compensation would have to be won through the courts?</p>
<p>A good argument could be made that we all should share some of that risk and that parliament ought to adopt a law instituting a no-fault compensation system, similar to those for motor vehicle accidents. A number of American states, as well as the province of Quebec already have such a statute in place.</p>
<p>A great deal needs to be done so that a pandemic vaccination program can benefit the population to the greatest degree, be respectful of individuals, and be delivered with justice. During such a crucial time, an ethically sound pandemic vaccination program can foster solidarity and help us emerge from the pandemic crisis a more cohesive and humane society.</p>

<p>Want to beat the swine flu rap? Then rap with New York City doctor John Clarke. The musical MD's homespun rap song is one of 10 finalists in a U.S. Department of Health competition for best swine flu health warning. "H1N1, showing hate, never pity,/ nicknamed swine flu, coz it ain't ever pretty," Clarke raps. "H1N1 is in the hood./ Use hand sanitizer and/wash your hands good." The song, which appears on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, is one of more than 200 submissions in the competition, which closes Sept. 16.</p>

<p>Education Minister Dave Hancock is quickly becoming the government's bad news boy. After cutting $80 million from education last week, he now promises --or threatens--much more to come.</p>
<p>One of his trial balloons is larger class sizes, a battle Alberta's teachers thought they won in 2007.</p>
<p>An ominous thought dawns; if the Tories sense public support, we could be thrown back into the savage spending cuts of the early Ralph Klein era.</p>
<p>Education was especially devastated. Class sizes ballooned. Most support for special needs kids was stripped away, leaving them to cope in regular classrooms.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s, teachers and students marched in the streets after salaries were cut five per cent.</p>
<p>School systems have slowly been winning back those losses for a decade. Now, everything could be at risk again.</p>
<p>The goal would be different though--to keep Alberta entirely debt-free, rather than to abolish large debt. It's a tougher case to make.</p>
<p>The Tories have one huge advantage, though.</p>
<p>In late 2007 they bought five years of labour peace by agreeing to pour $2.1 billion into the teachers' pension fund.</p>
<p>Those payments ($500 million this year alone) are part of their fiscal problem. But they also prevent any strikes before Aug. 31, 2012.</p>
<p>The Tories should still beware that date if they intend to fiddle with class sizes or other agreements, says Frank Bruseker, past-president of the Alberta Teachers' Association.</p>
<p>"Nothing prevents strikes after that," he says. "We will fight for gains made in the classroom."</p>
<p>There's no doubt, though, that the Tories have a clear field to slash away for three years.</p>
<p>Does the public really want</p>
<p>the 1990s all over again?</p>
<p>The sad swine-flu death of a New Zealand visitor, stepfather of a World-Skills competitor, is dreadful for the family and evokes the sympathy of every Calgarian.</p>
<p>It's a tragic thing to happen to people who come here in high excitement to cheer on their daughter.</p>
<p>On a wider level, though, this personal disaster also sends shudders through both city hall and the provincial government.</p>
<p>Every public official dreads the unlucky random stroke that can brand a city or province as the epicentre of disaster.</p>
<p>It happened to Toronto with SARS in 2003 after the World Health Authority issued an advisory against non-essential travel to the city.</p>
<p>The advisory was soon lifted, but the damage was done; the city's reputation needed a much longer recovery time than most SARS patients.</p>
<p>SARS was not trivial --43 people died in Toronto alone, more than half the number of H1N1 flu patients who have perished so far in all of Canada.</p>
<p>But it never broke loose into the general population. Toronto's black eye was completely undeserved.</p>
<p>Perhaps with such examples in mind, Alberta's chief medical officer, Dr. Andre Corriveau, was quick to point out Friday that the New Zealander first showed symptoms the day after he got off the plane. Because the incubation period is about four days, the man could not have contracted the disease in Alberta.</p>
<p>Inevitably, though, a newspaper in Wellington, New Zealand's capital, said Friday that "Canada has the third-highest number of confirmed swine flu cases and deaths after the United States and Mexico."</p>
<p>That's true. But the newspaper failed to say that New Zealand has a higher death rate by population than Canada.</p>
<p>Soon, thousands of WorldSkills competitors will go home knowing only that H1N1 flu killed a visitor in Calgary.</p>
<p>Cindy Ady, Alberta's tourism minister, says all the province can do is release accurate information as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>She's right--but it doesn't always work, as Toronto knows all too well.</p>

<p>"What's the best natural way to boost immunity against the swine flu virus?" a reader from Winnipeg inquires. It's a good question, as currently this virus is killing small numbers of people. But some researchers believe that H1N1 will return in a few weeks with a vengeance, killing thousands of North Americans. If this happens, can it be possible that a group of powerful medicinal mushrooms can decrease the risk of succumbing to this virus?</p>
<p>But first, during an epidemic, never forget these basic precautions. Handshaking has always been an unhealthy habit, a prime way to spread infection. Get further protection by washing your hands frequently with soap and water.</p>
<p>Keep your distance from those who are coughing or sneezing, particularly when they don't cover their mouths. One single sneeze fires out 40,000 infectious droplets at the speed of 160 km/h.</p>
<p>Minimize stress as it increases cortisol and the adrenal hormones, which decrease resistance to infection. Be sure to get adequate sleep, as those who are tired are more susceptible to infection. Stop smoking. There's overwhelming evidence that smokers are less resistant to infections. And keep vaccinations up to date. Other infections will still be around long after the H1N1 is history.</p>
<p>Eat smart. This means a well-balanced diet of whole grains and colourful fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, carrots, cherries and plums. These are loaded with vitamins, minerals and protective phytonutrients that bolster the body's defences against disease. And add protein from wholesome fish, meat and poultry.</p>
<p>But can powerful medicinal mushrooms increase immunity? Specific mushrooms have been used in the Orient for hundreds of years to support the immune system as an aid in fighting infection. Researchers have discovered that some of these mushrooms are better than others in building up immunity. But let the buyer beware.</p>
<p>Investigation shows that some imported mushroom preparations from China contain only rice flour and nutmeg. Others produced in the U.S. were found to have few of the active ingredients required to increase immunity. What these preparations should have contained was a mushroom called Cordyceps sinensis, one of a group of powerful fungi.</p>
<p>A natural mushroom product called ImmuneAssist 24/7 has been developed by a U.S. nutraceutical company. It is prepared by a method called "hybridization" and contains Cordyceps sinensis, plus five other super mushrooms.</p>
<p>Hybridization isn't the same as genetic modifications, such as cloning. Rather, it's a traditional method of crossbreeding mushrooms to enhance their natural immune-stimulating powers. Hybridization is not a new process. For instance, before this method was applied to potatoes, they were the size of your little finger.</p>
<p>Research shows that the full spectrum Cordyceps sinensis hybrid has five times the potency of wild harvested Cordyceps sinensis. The other five mushrooms are also highly purified, making them rich with 200 immune-enhancing polysaccharides, which stimulate the human immune response.</p>
<p>This provides a much broader immune response particularly when it's not known what type of virus will be present. It's like providing the doctor with a combination of 200 different antibiotics. There's a good chance that you would be getting the right one to fight the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>This combination of powerful ingredients in ImmuneAssist 24/7 increases the activity of natural killer cells. And this super mushroom product also contains EGCG, the polyphenol compound found in green tea that helps to keep viral particles from being able to multiply within cells, and is effective against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Some researchers H1N1 will become resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu. If that happens all the more reason to boost your own immunity as it may be your first and most reliable defence.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Do we need a fourth election in five years?</b>

</p>
<p>Federal Transport Minister John Baird states that the fourth election in five years is not wanted by Canadians. The Conservatives should have realized this when Stephen Harper prorogued parliament last fall. Mr. Baird says another election will delay or stop stimulus funding from flowing. The truth is that if there is an election called, nothing can stop committed funding from flowing except the government in power, even during an election campaign. So will the Conservatives stop or delay funding to punish Canadians, then try and blame the Liberals? The 68 per cent of Canadians who are in support of other political parties need to know.</p>
<p>Gerald McIvor, Winnipeg</p>
<p>I am still not sure how Michael Ignatieff finessed his way into the Liberal party leadership but his profile is dead in the water. Whenever there is a human rights issue begging to be commented upon it is Bob Rae who comes across with true compassion and forthright indignation about a federal government lacking in compassion. Failure to stand up for Canadians abroad is the lightning rod that could send the Tories to the back benches. It has been a real embarrassment for Canada.</p>
<p>And, that's only one issue where the government has been a failure. Since multiple parties almost guarantee minority governments we need to see the left unite under one banner just as the right did by bringing together Reform and the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Bob Rae, as former leader of the Ontario NDP, would be the ideal bridge to make this happen. Unfortunately, the egos of both Michael Ignatieff and Jack Layton stand in the way of this ever happening, but I am convinced that it would be in the best interests of Canada.</p>
<p>Al Truscott, Collingwood</p>
<p>Does this Prime Minister's hypocrisy know no bounds? A year ago, he insisted that a vote was necessary to "deal with the economy." He's now saying that we should not have an election in order to "deal with the economy." Which statement is true, Mr. Harper or, as I suspect, neither one is.</p>
<p>Michelle Guilmette, Toronto</p>
<p>Hasn't anyone told Mr. Ignatieff about H1N1 influenza? This fall is hardly the time for an election with all kinds of electioneering germ sharing and potential for large numbers of voters to avoid the polls in the midst of an anticipated H1N1 resurgence. This kind of leadership does not appear to have the best interests of the public in mind. Yes, the Liberals should be very nervous about this approach.</p>
<p>Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Kanata</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper says that he hasn't met a single Canadian who wants a fall election. Are we to assume then that Mr. Harper has not met Mr. Ignatieff?</p>

<p>CALGARY -- The H1N1-related death of a New Zealand man who was visiting Calgary to watch his daughter participate in the WorldSkills competition should not deter people from attending the so-called Olympic Games of the trades or other large-scale events, health officials in Alberta say.</p>
<p>André Corriveau, the province's chief medical officer of health, said people shouldn't avoid the event, but rather take precautions such as hand washing, or, if they feel flu-like symptoms, staying home temporarily.</p>
<p>“We're still not recommending that people should cancel,” said Dr. Corriveau. “… I hope they don't have any concerns about continuing their participation in the games.”</p>
<p>Alberta announced yesterday that a middle-aged man who travelled to Canada on Aug. 28 from New Zealand is the eighth person to die in the province of causes connected to the H1N1 virus. Officials wouldn't say if the man had underlying health conditions, which have been cited as contributing factors in other H1N1 deaths.</p>
<p>The unidentified man was to be among an estimated 150,000 spectators taking in WorldSkills at the Stampede grounds. The event features more than 900 competitors aged 17 to 22, representing 51 countries, putting their talents to the test in everything from auto-body repair to landscaping.</p>
<p>The event is expected to pump $82-million into the city's economy.</p>
<p>The New Zealand man began showing symptoms the day after he arrived in Calgary. His condition worsened, and on Sept. 2, he went to a hospital emergency room. He died the next day.</p>
<p>Health officials call it an “isolated case.”</p>
<p>The man likely contracted the virus at home in the Southern Hemisphere, which is coming out of its peak annual flu season, or possibly on the plane to Canada, Dr. Corriveau said.</p>
<p>“H1N1 is everywhere in the world. It's really something everybody is facing,” he said.</p>
<p>Nobody the man had close contact with has exhibited symptoms, but officials are following up. The man's family has been asked to stay in their hotel room as a precaution to watch for symptoms. The incubation period of the virus is two to four days.</p>

<p>According to news reports, federal Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff's "inner circle" would love to see him as prime minister presiding over the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Why they would want that is not entirely clear to Canadians who live in the real world. The only politician that most of us associate with the Olympic Games being held in Canada is former Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau, who famously declared that the 1967 Montreal Olympics could no more run a deficit than a "man could have a baby."</p>
<p>As it turned out, those games ended up with a deficit of a couple of billion dollars -- that was real money, back in those days -- and a bunch of white elephants; the Olympic stadium and the celebrated living quarters called Habitat. Since the Vancouver Games are starting to look pretty pregnant already, one has to wonder why Ignatieff's inner circle is so eager to lay claim to its paternity.</p>
<p>Surely it would be better to blame it on British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell, the natural father who insists that the government will spend no more than $765 million on the Games, even though the preparation for them has already cost about $4 billion, or on Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, even though he has never laid a finger on the lady in question and probably never hopes to.</p>
<p>It is possible that Ignatieff and his inner circle were standing too close to the smoke stacks at the Sudbury nickel smelter when they leaked this news at the beginning of a three-day caucus meeting in the mining town -- who knows what they're burning there as <span class="companylink">Vale Inco</span> undergoes some truly bitter labour strife. But on the other hand, what other reason could the Liberal leader possibly offer for threatening to bring down the government at the earliest opportunity when Parliament returns Sept. 14?</p>
<p>In a press conference this week that was uncharacteristic for the usually soft-spoken Harvard University academic, Ignatieff and his men of the deep, or men of the depths, as the dark minds of the Liberal party's back room are more commonly thought of in political circles, warned Harper that "we've kept this government on life support for 10 months" and that they have no intention of continuing to do so.</p>
<p>"Mr. Harper, your time is up," Ignatieff said, and even the more sensible members of his caucus, the ones who care more about their seats and security than who presides over the Vancouver Olympics, emerged from the meeting agreeing with him. It was a Sudbury Friday afternoon, rather the infamous Sudbury Saturday Night immortalized by Stompin' Tom Connors, but Mad-Dog Michael Ignatieff got his way there and if he has his way when Parliament resumes, the whole country, or those who are not too tired of voting in elections that have no rhyme nor reason, will be stomping through the snow to the polls probably sometime in November.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Michael Ignatieff as tough guy doesn't play too well. People who had high hopes for him when he returned to Canada to contest the Liberal leadership after the resignation of former prime minister Jean Chretien -- people like me -- thought that he could take the Liberal party back to where it belongs, in the sensible centre on social issues and on the front lines of the defence of freedom and democracy on international issues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Canadian Liberalism seems to be a lot like swine flu -- highly contagious and occasionally deadly to those exposed to it. How else does one explain Ignatieff's behaviour first as a Liberal frontbencher and leadership candidate and now as a designated party leader after the Stephane Dion debacle?</p>
<p>Most Canadians don't want an election right now. Polls show that most Canadians don't see any reason for an election right now. The Liberals can't even offer an excuse for an election right now other than that they would like to see Michael Ignatieff at Whistler wearing a prime minister's hat, rather than just as another politico.</p>
<p>Ten months ago, when the Liberal leader made his deal with the devil and agreed to prop up Stephen Harper's minority government in the face of absolute opposition from the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois, the country seemed to be in trouble, and Ignatieff looked the better for it.</p>
<p>Today the country is in a better position. The recession did not hit here like it did other industrialized nations -- Canadians were hurt, but they got off easier than Americans or Europeans or Chinese or Indians. That is in part thanks to Conservative policies, but it is also in part thanks to Liberal co-operation with the government. Had the Grits gone with the NDP or the Bloc, God knows what grief we would be feeling today.</p>
<p>Hardly a day had passed after Ignatieff issued his peculiar ultimatum in the fume-filled air of Sudbury than it was announced that for the first time in 10 months, more jobs were created than were lost in Canada in July and many economists argue now that the recession is essentially over, that the economy has bottomed out and started to rise again.</p>
<p>That kind of takes the resonance out of the Liberal argument about Conservative government mismanagement, particularly when Ignatieff has no policy alternatives to offer other than just wait and see what I'll do when I am prime minister.</p>
<p>The polls also show that the Liberals and Conservatives enjoy equal support among a Canadian electorate, so there is no advantage there -- although the party that forces a November election for no good reason might well put a frost on its chances.</p>
<p>The results of any early election would almost certainly be another minority government, which would make no one happy. Unless Ignatieff is really eager to get back to Harvard, he should keep to his seat on the opposition side of the House until he has a better reason than the Olympics to bring down a government that is actually working fairly well. And while he is doing that, he might try following his own advice when he was elected leader of the Liberal party earlier this year: We need a new face on politics, he said. We should "astonish ourselves." He can do that by taking the Liberal party back where it belongs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Amid flu worries, don't forget meningitis -</b>
</div><div>By Lauran Neergaard   </div>
<div>370 words</div><div>5 September 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>C15</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- Fever, chills, vomiting: It starts like a stomach bug or the flu. But bacterial meningitis can go on to kill terrifyingly fast -- one of the few infections in the U.S. and Canada where someone can feel fine in the morning and be dead by night. And prime targets are tweens, teens and college freshmen.</p>
<p>Amid all the publicity about children's flu shots this year is concern that vaccination against meningococcal meningitis not fall by the wayside, just as doctors are charting progress against the rare but devastating infection.</p>
<p>In the two years since the U.S. government recommended that every adolescent be vaccinated, close to 40 per cent of tweens and teens are, says Dr. Carol Baker, a pediatric vaccine specialist at Baylor College of Medicine.</p>
<p>That's a decent start considering parents seldom hear about the tough-to-pronounce illness. It affects only about 2,000 Americans a year, with rates recently inching down to historic lows.</p>
<p>But about 15 per cent of the people who catch this fast-moving germ die -- and one in five of the survivors suffer permanent disabilities including brain damage, deafness or amputated limbs.</p>
<p>"What hasn't changed is the severity," warns Baker, past-president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. "The risk is less but if it's your kid, it's everything."</p>
<p>Olga Pasick's son David had just started eighth grade in Wall Township, N.J., in 2004 when one Sunday evening he got a fever. Vomiting began late in the night. The next morning, the pediatrician took one look at the purplish rash forming on David's chest -- infection spreading through his bloodstream -- and ordered him straight to the hospital.</p>
<p>"He was upset because he wanted to go to school," recalls Pasick. Instead, hours later, the 13-year-old was dead.</p>
<p>The nurses' Voices of Meningitis campaign is overshadowed by attention to the H1N1 flu. Baker, who's not involved with the group, worries about an uptick in meningococcal infections this fall and winter. That's when the disease is most common. Plus, a prior bout of flu can make you more susceptible.</p>

<p>The school of public health at the University of Saskatchewan is focusing on improving the health of residents of Saskatoon and beyond, says the head of the new school.</p>
<p>"We look at communities. We're concerned about the prevention of diseases in communities, not just H1N1, but such things as obesity, suicide, mental health issues, heart disease, cancer, injuries," said Robert Buckingham, executive director of the school.</p>
<p>The school, which takes a multidisciplinary approach to public health, has 24 full- and part-time faculty.</p>
<p>Enrolment in the two-year program, which accepted its first students last year, stands at about 60 students.</p>
<p>"What I'm doing here is developing a school to bring people, public health professionals, mostly physicians and also some non-physicians, into the realm of serving the community and I'm talking about the community at large, not just Saskatoon, but the province and the country itself," he said in an interview this week, after presenting his inaugural address that outlined his vision for the school.</p>
<p>Buckingham, who received his doctorate of public health from the Yale University school of medicine, has worked in Honduras, Thailand and some countries in Africa. He is particularly interested in infectious diseases and in the health of aboriginal people.</p>

<p>A New Zealand man who died from H1N1 complications in Calgary this week developed the disease before arriving, Alberta's chief medical officer said Friday.</p>
<p>The middle age man was in Calgary for WorldSkills 2009, an event that sees young professionals from trades, service and technical programs around the world compete and show off their talents. The New Zealand man, who died Thursday, was a relative of a competitor. He arrived in Calgary on Aug. 28 and was not staying with any of the competition participants.</p>
<p>Chief medical officer Dr. Andre Corriveau said he wants to reassure foreign visitors and others attending the competition that public health officials are taking all appropriate precautions.</p>

</p>
<p>Frontline health-care workers can expect new guidelines from the federal government in the coming weeks on how to cope with the expected second wave of the swine flu pandemic, following a two-day conference that heard repeated concerns about the readiness of hospitals.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said Thursday the information shared over the course of the meetings would help inform the guidance that is also being developed in consultation with First Nations, provincial and territorial health authorities.</p>
<p>The guidance document, which Butler-Jones said would contain a "truly pan-Canadian approach" will include recommendations on how health-care workers can protect themselves, how to diagnose and treat severe cases and how to handle a surge of hospitalizations.</p>
<p>"Over the past two days we've heard some strategic recommendations on these issues presented to health authorities. We looked at gaps and how best we can fill them," Butler-Jones said at a news conference.</p>
<p>One of the major gaps that was focused on at the conference was the ability of hospitals to handle a big increase of patients and the planning to facilitate the sharing of personnel and equipment among jurisdictions. The swine flu virus, also known as H1N1, has been mild in most cases. But some Canadians, young patients in particular, have become severely ill and required intensive care in the hospital.</p>
<p>Many were hooked to ventilators, often for a prolonged period. Seventy-two deaths have been linked to the virus since the pandemic began in April. If the second wave hits harder than the first, hospitals -- and their intensive care units especially -- could be overwhelmed. Some of the concerns that have been expressed are around the availability of beds, ventilators, pharmaceuticals and staffing shortages.</p>
<p>"We know that intensive care units are already running at near or full capacity so surge capacity needs to be addressed as we develop the guidance we're working on," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>He urged hospitals to "catch up" and get their plans in place if they didn't do so over the summer.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensive care doctor in Winnipeg, echoed Butler-Jones' advice and said hospitals in his city "learned the hard way" about how to manage surge capacity when the first wave of the pandemic struck hard in the spring. They have since figured out how to double the number of ICU beds available should they be needed.</p>
<p>"I think other institutions in the regions really need to look at their surge capacity, really hard, and if they are not talking it seriously, they should be," he told reporters.</p>
<p>"There are, at least from the reports from my colleagues, significant variations in how ready hospitals in different regions are for what we might, I emphasize might, experience," said Kumar.</p>
<p>The key to easing the potential burden on hospitals and their ICUs is preventing cases from becoming severe. But beyond that is preventing infection in the first place.</p>
<p>The key prevention strategy is vaccination, which has been the centre of some controversy this week. An editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal said Monday that Canada is lagging behind other countries by aiming to roll out the swine flu vaccine in mid-November while other nations will start vaccinating in October.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones and Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq have defended their timeline all week but on Thursday, Butler-Jones said it could be adjusted if necessary. The actual vaccine will be in the country by October but mid-November is when they expect to have all the evidence from the clinical trials reviewed and the stamp of regulatory approval given, he said.</p>
<p>"We know that we will be able to do it before then," said Butler-Jones. "If, for example, we see the pandemic return earlier and more severely, we then will, if need be, adjust the timeline and approve earlier," he said.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of the vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. Groups identified as most vulnerable to the virus, including pregnant women and those living in remote communities, will be among the first to get the vaccine. Official guidelines on the "sequencing" of the vaccine are to be released by the federal government in mid-September.</p>

<p>Doctors are preparing for some different duties --and maybe even the return of house calls -- if the H1N1 virus hits the province hard, the president of the Saskatchewan Medical Association said Thursday.</p>
<p>Dr. George Miller said doctors are trying to clarify their roles if the influenza virus' potential resurgence this fall swells the number of sick and cuts a swathe through the ranks of health care professionals.</p>
<p>Miller, a Moose Jaw surgeon, said for him that could mean bringing elective surgeries to a halt while he takes care of patients in the hospital. Doctors may need to do over-the-phone screening of patients or be prepared to do some duties of other health care workers, he said.</p>
<p>"We have to be prepared to go out and see people in their homes, screening them before they get to hospital. Hospital emergency rooms may not be coping terribly well. We may be expected to do shifts in emergency and cover emergency casualty areas," he said.</p>
<p>"That's what you do in a crisis. You do what you do, you see what you see. We're all doctors first and we're specialists and other doctors second. So, if they need us, we'll be there."</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Medical Association and the provincial Ministry of Health are currently in negotiations over compensation in the case of an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>The issue has caused controversy in other provinces, especially Alberta, where the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) is working on a "physician financial support program" in that province with proposed rates of $518.45 an hour for night shifts, $403.24 an hour for evenings and weekends and $259.23 an hour for weekday shifts. But Miller said the issue for Saskatchewan doctors is not about cashing in but clarifying how they will be paid if they are performing different roles or extra work.</p>
<p>"The idea is, we're not looking for more money, we're looking at how we're going to get paid for our services under the circumstance," he said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Don McMorris said he could not comment on the Alberta negotiations.</p>
<p>But he said Saskatchewan was "not going to hold back financially" in dealing with H1N1 but the provincial discussions were about ensuring that doctors were "fairly reimbursed if their workload increases significantly."</p>

</p>
<p>An intensive-care doctor speaking yesterday at a conference on the H1N1 pandemic said the virus is the "most frightening" thing he has seen in his career - and other experts here warned that hospitals are not yet ready for a surge of severely sick patients.</p>
<p>In an interview just prior to his address, Dr. Anand Kumar said he wanted to give the audience "the flavour" of what hospitals can expect to see when the second wave of the pandemic is expected to hit this fall and winter.</p>
<p>"I think it's an absolutely massive onslaught of incredibly sick young people that I had never imagined I would see in my life," Kumar said of his experience treating patients in Winnipeg's intensive-care units. "It's startling, and more than a little frightening, especially when you don't know what the ceiling of this is going to be."</p>
<p>The two-day conference, which has drawn together about 150 health-care professionals and experts from across the country and around the world, is focused on how to manage severe cases of the swine flu and prevent them from deteriorating.</p>
<p>Also on the agenda are discussions about Canada's vaccine strategy - under attack this week by the Canadian Medical Association Journal - the use of antivirals, medical ethics and clinical care guidelines. The sessions are closed to the media.</p>
<p>Most cases of swine flu in Canada have been mild, but there is a subset of patients who are getting very sick. At least 72 deaths have been linked to H1N1 and more than 1,366 people have been hospitalized. Of those patients, more than 240 have spent time in intensive-care units.</p>
<p>The virus's behaviour differs from that of other flu bugs in that it attacks younger people at disproportionately higher rates, rather than the very old and very young, who are normally more susceptible to flu.</p>
<p>Kumar said that of the patients who were hospitalized in Winnipeg, two-thirds were young and healthy people who were "essentially struck down in the prime of their life."</p>
<p>"I've been doing this for 28 years and it's probably the most frightening thing I've ever seen professionally," he said.</p>

<p>Front-line health workers can expect new guidelines from the federal government in the coming weeks on how to cope with the expected second wave of swine flu, following a two-day conference that heard repeated concerns about the readiness of hospitals. Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said Thursday the information shared over the course of the meetings would help inform the guidance that is also being developed in consultation with First Nations, provincial and territorial health authorities.</p>

<p>Statins score as heart-friendly drug</p>
<p>Score another victory for the cheap, cholesterol-lowering wonder drugs known as statins.</p>
<p>A Dutch study says people getting an artery unclogged or repaired were much less likely to die or have a heart attack afterward if they took preventive doses of the pills before and after their operations.</p>
<p>Patients given Lescol had half the risk of having a heart attack or dying of a heart problem in the following month compared to those given dummy pills.</p>
<p>Tetris game increases grey matter</p>
<p>Research shows playing the video game Tetris regularly may increase grey matter in your brain and make you think more efficiently.</p>
<p>New Mexico researchers did MRIs on 26 adolescent girls, who were asked to play the popular puzzle game for half an hour daily over three months. They found improved efficiency in parts of the brain associated with critical thinking, reasoning, and language and processing.</p>
<p>The scans also revealed increases in matter in the brain's cortex in areas linked to complex, co-ordinated movements and integrating sensory experiences, such as sight, sound and touch, with other information.</p>
<p>Tetris is a video game in which players rotate coloured puzzle pieces as they land in completed rows.</p>
<p>Swine flu shot not popular</p>
<p>Canadians aren't clamouring to get the swine flu vaccine. A Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll indicates that only about 45 per cent of respondents intend to get the H1N1 vaccine later this fall. The poll also found that an equal percentage say they will not take the shot.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, calls the numbers "unfortunate," but admits the agency has actually seen worse. Some polls suggest the percentage of people who might agree to be vaccinated could range from 30 to 60 per cent.</p>
<p>Turn up AC during ragweed season</p>
<p>It's ragweed season and it's the bane of many allergy sufferers. That means several months of itchy, watering eyes, runny nose, sore throat, congestion and sleeping problems that won't ease up until first frost.</p>
<p>Allergy experts advise allergy sufferers to keep their windows closed and use air conditioning, which cleans, cools and dries the air. They also say allergy sufferers should consider staying indoors when pollen or mould counts are high between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.</p>
<p>And they also advise people to shower before bed to wash pollen out of their hair and off their body which will prevent pollen from settling on their pillows.</p>
<p>Monna has tweet hospital stay</p>
<p>Tweeting has now moved into hospitals -- as patients go under the knife. From anesthesia to the recovery room, the children of a 70-year-old Iowa woman recently followed her surgery -- 140 characters or less at a time. Most of Monna Cleary's family chose to track the developments from a laptop computer in the hospital's waiting room.</p>
<p>As Cleary underwent a hysterectomy and uterine prolapse surgery, hospital spokeswoman Sarah Corizzo posted a play-by-play of the operation on Twitter.</p>
<p>Corizzo sent more than 300 tweets over more than three hours from a computer outside the operating room -- to nearly 700 people who followed along.</p>

</div><div>Helen Branswell  </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>810 words</div><div>4 September 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The lungs of people who have died from swine flu look more like those of the victims of H5N1 avian influenza than those of people who succumb to regular flu, the chief of infectious diseases pathology at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control says.</p>
<p>Study of about 70 fatal H1N1 cases so far also reveals there may be more incidences of co-infections with bacteria than was earlier thought, Dr. Sherif Zaki said.</p>
<p>The damage to lung tissue is consistent with that inflicted by ARDS or acute respiratory distress symptom, Zaki says, referring to an often-fatal, difficult-to-treat syndrome that can have a number of causes. The U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute estimates about 30 per cent of people who develop ARDS die.</p>
<p>"In terms of the disease, yes, it (H1N1) is remarkably different than seasonal flu," Zaki says. "The pathology looks very similar to H5(N1)."</p>
<p>The dangerous avian flu virus has killed 60 per cent of 440 people known to have been infected with it. To date, though, the virus hasn't acquired the capacity to spread easily from person to person.</p>
<p>The swine flu patients who later died suffered lung damage and changes in the lungs that would have made it difficult to deliver enough oxygen into their bloodstreams, Zaki says.</p>
<p>That reflects the observation of intensive care doctors who've struggled to save these profoundly ill patients.</p>
<p>"That's what they saw in Winnipeg," Dr. Paul Hebert, an intensive care physician and editor of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, said recently of how hard it is to oxygenate swine flu patients who become gravely ill.</p>
<p>"They have everybody on experimental ventilators and techniques. They can barely keep them alive."</p>
<p>A number of doctors who have treated novel H1N1 patients -- and colleagues who haven't yet -- were meeting in Winnipeg this week discussing what steps hospitals and ICUs need to take to get ready for an expected increase in pandemic flu cases this fall and winter.</p>
<p>Zaki says finding ways to prevent cases from progressing to severe illness should be the goal, "because once it happens in these patients ... it's very difficult to treat."</p>
<p>Roughly 90 per cent of the cases studied had underlying medical conditions. A separate report issued by the CDC yesterday revealed that 67 per cent of the 36 American children who died from swine flu had at least one high risk medical condition, such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>"(Extreme) obesity was the top one and then hypertension or chronic cardiac conditions, asthma -- those were the top three," Dr. Dianna Blau, who works with Zaki, says of the adult cases. Others included diabetes and immune deficiencies.</p>
<p>Zaki says doctors treating people with these kinds of conditions should let patients know so they respond quickly if they catch the virus and get really sick.</p>
<p>Strikingly high levels of virus were spotted in the lungs of people who died rapidly from swine flu, he says, though less is seen in those who die after a longer battle with the virus.</p>
<p>"Some people die very quickly of it, within days. And some have more protracted illness, maybe two, three weeks.</p>
<p>"It's surprising the amounts (of virus) that you see ... . But it's not unheard of," he adds, pointing to SARS.</p>
<p>Earlier studies conducted in tissue culture and in ferrets -- the best animal model for human flu -- found the new virus is drawn to tissue found deep in the lung. That's a penchant it shares with H5N1. Seasonal flu viruses attack upper airways.</p>
<p>Zaki says about a third of the fatal cases his team has reviewed involved co-infection with a bacterium.</p>
<p>He suggests pneumococcal vaccine, used in the elderly to lower the risk of pneumonia, could be useful if given to younger people with underlying medical conditions. The most deaths so far have been in people in their late 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>The report on deaths in children revealed there were also significant rates of bacterial co-infections among the children who died of swine flu. It said doctors should be aware and treat children with antibiotics if co-infections are found.</p>
<p>"When you get the flu, your immune system can be a little weakened, you can be more susceptible to other infections," CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said yesterday during a media briefing.</p>
<p>"That's an important message for doctors to know that if someone has the flu, they get better, then they get worse again with high fever, that's a clue that maybe they should be treated with antibiotics."</p>

<p>The approach of flu season is being watched with alarm from many First Nations communities, where leaders say they are underfunded and underprepared for what might come. But the H1N1 pandemic is also providing an opportunity to improve aboriginal health generally.</p>
<p>The federal government is taking advantage of this opportunity. This week, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq held a press conference to talk about an injection of $400 million, allocated in the last federal budget, to expand and build new nursing stations in remote communities, improve services such as medical transportation, dental and vision care, and to add nurses so that care is available around the clock.</p>
<p>This money will provide badly needed health services in hard-to-reach places and will go some way to helping First Nations communities weather the storm. Indeed, H1N1 is expected to hit aboriginal communities particularly hard. Federal health officials must continue to listen to some of the specific concerns being raised by aboriginal leaders, some of whom told a parliamentary health committee last week that they fear their communities will be isolated without enough medical care and medical equipment.</p>
<p>David Harper, chief of Manitoba's Garden Hill reserve, said it takes 24 hours to get a sick member of his community flown in to a hospital in Winnipeg where ventilators are available. His community is raising money for a field hospital equipped with ventilators, something he says will be necessary if the flu hits as hard this fall as it did last spring. The federal government should believe those on the front lines when they say they need more medical help to get through the pandemic.</p>
<p>What's most encouraging is that some aboriginal communities are also using the arrival of H1N1 as an opportunity to begin making changes that will close the health gap between themselves and non-aboriginals.</p>
<p>In Ontario, the remote community of Garden River has created -- without help from either the federal or provincial government -- flu kits for each of its 500 homes. Each contains hand sanitizers, thermometers, information and a lollipop that monitors children's temperatures. The community's emergency preparedness guide -- reportedly four-inches thick, including a record of where all children go to school and a list of the most vulnerable citizens -- is being held up as a model that every First Nation and Inuit community in the country should adopt.</p>
<p>The Garden River First Nation has done more than simply show other bands how to prepare themselves for the pandemic. It has demonstrated that aboriginal peoples themselves should have a leadership role to play in improving health care in their own communities.</p>

</p>
<p>I read with interest the Citizen's extensive coverage of the H1N1 "pandemic." Although informative, there was very little written about how to stay healthy, besides washing your hands. As important as that is, we should, more importantly think about our health from the inside-out.</p>
<p>Are we maintaining a healthy immune system by following basic principles of health? A diet low in refined sugars, but rich in vegetables and essential fatty acids. Fresh unprocessed foods and adequate vitamin D levels to boost the immune system. Regular exercise and also adequate rest and a healthy mental attitude.</p>
<p>As a chiropractor, I must also mention having a healthy spine and nervous system, which has an intimate connection to our immune health. The media and public health officials have to be careful not to create such a fear-based approach which leaves people feeling weak and helpless when, in fact, they have the most powerful laboratory right inside their own body.</p>
<p>Another area of concern is vaccine risk. From the research that I have done, it appears that the H1N1 vaccine will contain the adjuvant squalene. This was used in the anthrax vaccine during the Gulf War and is linked to Gulf War Syndrome. There appears there could be an increase in auto-immune disorders when squalene is injected into the system. If that is true, we could expect an increase in auto-immune diseases in Canada from a mass vaccination program.</p>
<p>I think people should be better informed about the possible risks when considering whether to have a barely tested vaccine put into their bodies, and to not forget the basic principles of staying healthy from the inside out.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Don't underestimate value of handwashing to avoid flu</b>

<p>Re: Are we ready? Aug. 29.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Citizen staff for the extensive research and balance presented on the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>There is one key element missed which can help individuals tie some concepts together and also understand the controversy around masking. How do we get infected with influenza?</p>
<p>The virus is a droplet-borne infection where droplets from a cough or sneeze end up on surrounding surfaces. We unwittingly touch an infected surface and then touch our face and nose. That is how the virus establishes its place in the naso-pharynx. The key protective measure is frequent handwashing. However, we constantly touch surfaces, then touch and scratch our faces frequently throughout the day.</p>
<p>That is why the key protective message should be: Make sure your hands are clean before you touch your face.</p>
<p>If you have an itchy nose, don't rub or scratch unless your hands are washed. Don't eat unless your hands are washed.</p>
<p>Most importantly is to wash your hands after wiping your child's nose, shaking hands, using utensils in a buffet line or after pushing a grocery cart and before you touch your face. Where running water is not readily available, alcohol hand-gel in your car or purse comes in handy.</p>
<p>Why does masking not work in public settings? The main protective effect of a mask is preventing you from touching your nose (or respiratory secretions for health care workers). If removed without clean hands, you contaminate your face and the mask is rendered useless.</p>
<p>Then there is the type of mask. H1N1 is just influenza. Although there is and will be an increased overall burden of disease, the transmission is the same as seasonal "flu." Special masking is unnecessary and unhelpful. N95 masks are very difficult to wear for long periods of time. During SARS, many health care workers wore N95 masks improperly because of discomfort. The notion that a more virulent strain needs a different type of protection despite known transmission patterns has come about by intensive lobbying and not based on any scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Frequent handwashing is the key, but especially washing before contact with your own face. You never know where your hands have been or what you may have touched. Alcohol hand-wash stations should be placed at all restaurant and reception buffet lines. Great to contaminate your hands on the tongs before eating finger food! And please don't offer to shake my hand at the start of a two-hour meeting if you have a cold.</p>

<p>Swine flu vaccine will be ready,</p>
<p>officials say, Sept. 3</p>
<p>Many Canadians were probably relieved to read that Canada will have a vaccine ready for any Canadian who wants it to protect themselves from H1N1.</p>
<p>The threat of a flu pandemic has seen governments in developed countries mobilize quickly and efficiently to invest in a preventative measure, even though it isn't clear yet how protective the vaccine on its own will be.</p>
<p>And yet, the government of Canada is poised to let the Canadian International Immunization Initiative (CIII), a proven vaccination program, die. This is a program that we know saves thousands of children's lives every year for a fraction of the cost of the H1N1 vaccine and yet it may not be renewed.</p>
<p>If only we could see such quick and effective mobilization regarding diseases for which we already have the solutions available.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Bed bugs and bus riders -</b>
</div><div>By Catherine Mitchell    </div>

</p>
<p>It's been a year since I ditched the keys and started hopping the bus. The jury's out on whether I'll be marking an anniversary again this time next year.</p>
<p>It's been lovely being green and getting to know fellow busers. I like a lot of the people I've met, including those I get to know from half a cell-phone conversation.</p>
<p>Nothing beats leaving the driving to a professional when the snow falls. Dedicated bus lanes are to die for.</p>
<p>But there are drawbacks, not the least of which is the fact that my commute takes an hour each way, despite the fact I live in a central neighbourhood.</p>
<p>And, last week, there was this: About 10 minutes into my north Main ride, it dawned on me that the sustained warmth of my upholstered seat could not be explained by the relative weight of the last occupant. The seat was, in fact, wet.</p>
<p>The driver was terrific about it all. And given the array of ever-entertaining experiences on the bus, a part of me thinks, well, it's happened only once over 12 months -- probably not bad.</p>
<p>Still, walking to work (which I did, to dry off) wet is pretty much a deal breaker. Not even the thought of standing in the wind-swept reaches of a soulless industrial park in the dark of a mid-January evening approaches the distaste of a wet seat.</p>
<p>Truth be told, this is adding to a glass that's half full of a brew of neuroses. People cough and sneeze on me almost daily on the bus -- "promiscuous coughing and sneezing" was how Winnipeg's medical health officer described it in Sept., 1918 -- and I'm growing rapidly intolerant of it as the return of the H1N1 bug grows nearer. I've been waiting for the aggressive public health poster campaign to turn the free sneezers into social pariahs and shame them into smothering it in the crook of their arms. It hasn't happened, so I expect I'll continue to be a target well into flu season this fall.</p>
<p>Next, I cannot stop thinking about the bed bug infestations that have risen like a plague in this city. Poulin's tells me that up until 2008, they rarely got calls for bed bugs. Last year, 1,000 visits. It's a global phenomenon that has enveloped North America, blamed in part on the diminishing menu of pesticides available for battling the scourge and also increased global travel.</p>
<p>Lincoln Poulin travels Western Canada for his business and says infestations cross socio-economic boundaries. He's treated a hotel where rooms run at $2,500 a night.</p>
<p>Bugs ride the bus. An entomologist told me a student collected a bed bug off the shoulder of a bus rider sitting in front of her.</p>
<p>Bed bugs are not a health threat, per se, but they can wreak havoc if they infiltrate your home, and getting rid of them comes at some cost and great inconvenience.</p>
<p>Poulin tells me it's unlikely that you'll carry home a bed bug from a bus, and if he were a transit rider, he wouldn't change his routine out of fear of bugs. Since he knows how to spot and eliminate them, he may have a higher bug-risk tolerance than I do.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Transit does not have a routine de-infestation program for its buses, which I understand -- it reacts to reports of bugs. But I got to wonder what are the chances of someone spotting a bed bug, and then take the time to report it to Transit.</p>
<p>Riding the bus should be a mindless, routine kind of thing. I get cranky having to check the seat, duck a nasal blowback or contemplate the possibility of hitchhiking vermin. I'm sure lots of other riders feel the same.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the option is because you can't eliminate the problems that naturally come with sharing your ride en masse.</p>
<p>I can grab the keys and take to the thoroughfare again, but I'll miss those things that accompany transit, including stress-free commutes on snowy days and the daily mental margarita that those precious minutes of pleasure reading offer.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sold on being a quitter, but I know I am not a die-hard transit rider. Maybe I'll start drawing up some posters.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Would you make a deal with these politicians? -</b>
</div><div>Dan Lett   </div>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Canadian political edition of Deal or No Deal! The wildly popular game show where leaders of Canada's three national parties face off to see if a minority government lives for another year, or whether we head back to the polls for the fourth election in five years.</p>
<p>Our first contestant is NDP Leader Jack Layton, whose party is running a distant third in national opinion polls and who may finally hold the balance of power in this parliament.</p>
<p>Jack -- it's up to you. Do you barter with the Tories, extort a few concessions, and vote with the government in September to avoid an election? Or do you stand firm, vote the Tories down and head home to Toronto for a moustache trim and comfortable shoes?</p>
<p>Come on Jack, deal or no deal?</p>
<p>"I'm not making any backroom deals with the prime minister," Layton said Thursday in unequivocally proclaiming there was no deal.</p>
<p>But wait, is that a waffle? You're aren't prepared to offer the Tories a deal, but you're willing to listen to a deal? "It's up to the prime minister to reach out to us."</p>
<p>OK, you won't make a deal unless the Tories want to make a deal. And then you're willing to consider a deal? Fantastic.</p>
<p>On to Prime Minister Stephen Harper. What say you -- do we strike an accord to avoid an election you could very well lose or do we break out the sweater vests and frozen campaign-trail smile and hit the hustings? Deal or no deal?</p>
<p>"We will not be doing backroom deals," a stern Harper said Thursday. "We're not going to be getting into that kind of deal."</p>
<p>OK prime minister, to coin a phrase made famous on another competing game show, is that you're final answer? "If other parties have useful ideas -- good effective, affordable ideas -- on the economy, let us see what they are and we'll take a look at them."</p>
<p>To recap, you aren't going to make any backroom deals but you're prepared to go to the front parlour and talk turkey if the opposition parties have an offer? Okey-dokey then.</p>
<p>Our final contestant is Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff. In the recent past, you waited too long to say whether you would make a deal to avoid an election or vote against the government to bring it down. As a result, you positioned your party as parliament's perpetual fall guys and made yourself look like Harper's chew toy.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ball game now, Mr. Ignatieff. You've already said you'll vote as soon as possible to bring down the government. Do you stand pat on that position or is there wiggle room? Deal or no deal?</p>
<p>"Mr. Harper, your time is up," Ignatieff told supporters earlier this week.</p>
<p>So there you have it. It's 'no deal' from all the contestants and yet, there remains the real possibility of a deal. It would be deeply funny if it weren't for the fact that the deliberations on whether to plunge the country into another election is hardly a game.</p>
<p>The economy is teetering on the edge of a mild recovery. Although an election in and of itself wouldn't likely upset that trend there would be problems created by a transition should a party other than the Tories takes power.</p>
<p>And there is the impending autumn round of the H1N1 pandemic. A vote of non-confidence in September could allow the country to vote again before flu season hits. However, a vote that takes place later in the fall might see sneezing and coughing replace canvassing and debating. Remember, an achy, snotty voter is an unpredictable voter.</p>
<p>The biggest concern is that the Liberals, who have been less equivocal than the other two parties, still have not yet defined why we need an election. We understand that Ignatieff believes he can "do better" than Harper, but we don't know exactly what he would do and how.</p>
<p>In the absence of a defining issue, Ignatieff appears more interested in triggering an election because of poll results (the Tories and Liberals are running neck and neck in the latest surveys) and not because the Liberals have figured out how to contain H1N1, balance the budget and get the growing number of unemployed Canadians back to work. Voters should be cautious of any party that claims a change in government would accomplish all these things.</p>
<p>All three parties have spoken about making parliament work, but it's pretty clear none of them know how. All three use and abuse the language of co-operation, but in the end the three leaders are immersed in partisan self-interest. The punch line here is that even with all that bluster, it's quite likely none of them, including the Liberals, really want an election right now.</p>
<p>However, what they do want is for someone else to take the blame should an election be called.</p>
<p>Note: a column in this space on Thursday wrongly identified Steve Ashton as the minister responsible for water stewardship. He is the minister of intergovernmental affairs.</p>

<p>A Winnipeg doctor and researcher is offering 50 willing Winnipeggers a chance to get an H1N1 flu shot weeks and maybe even months before the vaccine becomes widely available.</p>
<p>Fred Aoki, a professor at the University of Manitoba's medical school and a practising physician, has been tapped by drug manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to lead one of the country's tests of the new vaccine.</p>
<p>Aoki's trial will be the only adult one in Manitoba. The 50 people he's hoping to recruit could get the shot as early as Oct. 6, part of clinical trials of the vaccine that will see 4,000 Canadians test the shot. The vaccine isn't expected to be officially rolled out until mid-November -- and even then the first shots could be earmarked for those most at risk of getting sick.</p>
<p>Despite daily pleas from health officials to get flu shots and huge publicity around a possible deadly pandemic, Aoki said willing guinea pigs have so far been scarce.</p>
<p>"I think the public is a bit wary and a bit confused," said Aoki. "There have been a lot of mixed messages going on."</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said Thursday that the H1N1 vaccine will be in hand in October with testing done by mid-November. Speaking to reporters at a flu conference in Winnipeg, he said that timeline can be sped up if the pandemic hits earlier than expected.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Campbell, Hansen stories falling flat</b>
</div><div>Les Leyne </div>

</p>
<p>One of the few amusing parts of this week's budget update was when Finance Minister Colin Hansen tried to be gracious.</p>
<p>"The numbers that are in this budget are not my numbers," he told assembled reporters and a few hundred stakeholders invited into the lockup.</p>
<p>"The numbers in this budget are numbers that have been developed by I believe one of the finest group of people working in a ministry of finance anywhere in Canada. They are our experts, they do the analysis and they come up with these numbers."</p>
<p>Was it my imagination, or did the whole finance crew recoil in horror at the idea of being publicly associated with this mess?</p>
<p>Hansen thanking staff for their work on this effort is like the president of General Motors thanking his team for making the company so viable.</p>
<p>The finance wizards are actually very good. But they are not going to be listing the September budget update very high up on their resumes.</p>
<p>The new deputy finance minister, Graham Whitmarsh, must be squirming as much as the rest of them.</p>
<p>Hansen was so keen to spread the credit around that he dragged his deputy -- kicking and screaming, no doubt -- into the "what did he know, when did he know it?" argument about the deficit.</p>
<p>The minister's story to date is that he pegged the deficit at $495 million in the February budget and held to it through the election campaign, a time during which protocol dictates that cabinet ministers don't have regular contact with their bureaucrats.</p>
<p>But in the middle of a news conference over the budget update -- in which the deficit is six times higher -- he offered Version 1.1.</p>
<p>"The first time I ever had any indication ... that our revenue projections may be taking a bigger hit than we anticipated, was in a casual conversation that I had in the middle of the election when the deputy minister indicated to me as an aside actually at the end of a relatively brief discussion that our revenue might be under pressure to the tune of $200 or $300 million."</p>
<p>He later added that that was for the entire year, not just the first part. But he thought spending curtailments could easily match that shortfall. So the $495 million was "totally manageable." And no one told him otherwise.</p>
<p>Version 1.1.1, offered yesterday to reporters after a chamber of commerce appearance, has some refinements.</p>
<p>On election day, the ministry finished formal projections in order to brief the new or returning government on what's what. So after the Liberals won on May 12, Hansen learned it was far, far worse than that.</p>
<p>The projection was a $1.1 billion fall-off in revenues.</p>
<p>Even then, Hansen said they could still have managed with the minimal deficit. He insisted as much when he was sworn in on June 10.</p>
<p>But that's where the other big secret comes in. By then, he knew they were likely going to adopt the harmonized sales tax, which would bring the $1.6-billion windfall from Ottawa.</p>
<p>So he was able to stick to the old number because he had still-secret, new information.</p>
<p>"On June 10, when I indicated at Government House that a $495 million deficit was still doable, the information I had at that time, which we learned only at the end of May, is that we would, if we adopted HST, have access to $1.6 billion."</p>
<p>Premier Gordon Campbell was also updating his story yesterday, and also bringing his deputy into the fray. Earlier he'd cited the election protocol and said there's not a lot of discussion between ministers and staff. But yesterday he told the legislature that deputy minister Jessica McDonald did tell him mid-campaign -- after a briefing on the H1N1 flu alarm -- that revenues were dropping.</p>
<p>No one told him that the $495-million deficit should be junked. In fact, he was assured it was still the target.</p>
<p>If you're charitably inclined, their story hangs together -- by a thread.</p>
<p>But there are lots of skeptics aware of how fast everything was tanking earlier this year. They know how badly the Liberals needed to be seen as strong economic managers. And they're familiar with the doctrine of "plausible deniability."</p>
<p>And they're not buying a word of it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nothing in budget will head off cuts to VIHA spending</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts </div>

</p>
<p>Health-care managers at the Vancouver Island Health Authority received no surprises in Tuesday's B.C. budget and are continuing to look for $45 million in cuts.</p>
<p>Shannon Marshall, spokeswoman for the authority, said those cuts will be identified this month when the region releases spending plans for its expected $1.7-billion budget for 2009-10.</p>
<p>But Marshall said VIHA is working hard to maintain those health-care services it will designate as a priority while still trimming costs. "We are working toward balancing that budget."</p>
<p>This year's $45-million projected deficit was revealed in July. Since then, the authority has said it can address the gap with things like administrative cuts and keeping elective surgeries and MRIs at 2008-09 levels.</p>
<p>Tuesday's budget confirmed earlier government statements about health care. Total health-care spending will increase by about six per cent to about $14.15 billion.</p>
<p>While the province's five health authorities have yet to receive letters confirming what their government grants will be, the government has promised those grants will continue to rise. A final allocation for health authorities has not been identified.</p>
<p>The government has pledged that health authorities' grants will increase by 19 per cent over three years from the roughly $8 billion awarded the regions in 2008-09.</p>
<p>The B.C. Nurses' Union and the Hospital Employees' Union said the spending plans will amount to a cut in health-care services.</p>
<p>Deb McPherson, president of the B.C. Nurses' Union, said in a telephone interview that with a predicted pandemic of H1N1 influenza on the way, now is the last time to get stingy with health care.</p>

</p>
<p>After being criticized for having one of the worst rates of hand-cleaning among Ontario hospitals, the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario has released the results of a follow-up audit showing a marked improvement in how often its staff wash their hands.</p>
<p>The new hand-hygiene rates are being issued as the hospital braces for a busy fall flu season, which could feature a sharp jump in the number of sick children with symptoms of the H1N1 swine-flu virus.</p>
<p>In July and August, when the audit was conducted, CHEO doctors and nurses were observed to have followed provincial hand-cleaning rules 83 per cent of the time: more than double the rate reported in May.</p>
<p>"We are extremely pleased with these results," said Michel Bilodeau, CHEO's chief executive. "They are a really good indication of the hard work that was put in and CHEO's commitment to (the) highest quality of patient care and patient safety."</p>
<p>The results of the follow-up audit were released Wednesday as part of CHEO's pledge to issue quarterly updates, at least over the next fiscal year, on how often its doctors and nurses clean their hands.</p>
<p>Bilodeau said the hospital's board had requested the quarterly updates in the hope that, by reminding them they were being observed, staff would do more to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
<p>"I think that will be the case as long as we're not satisfied that the situation has stabilized," Bilodeau said.</p>
<p>The quarterly reports go beyond what is required of Ontario hospitals, which earlier this year became the first in the country to release annual statistics on hand-hygiene compliance in an effort to improve patient safety.</p>
<p>Judy Dennis, CHEO's manager of infection prevention and control, acknowledged that keeping the compliance rates high would be a challenge.</p>
<p>"All the (research) literature will show that you can do an education program and get the numbers up, but the numbers will fall," Dennis said. "So we have an expectation that the numbers will fall again, and that we'll have to continue to come back to it and revisit it and be sure that we can keep them high on an ongoing basis."</p>
<p>Under the new provincial rules, hospital workers are supposed to clean their hands before and after treating patients, after touching objects in a patient's room, before and after special procedures, such as giving needles, and after contact with body fluids, such as blood and urine.</p>
<p>A previous figure, collected between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2009, showed that CHEO staff complied with hand-hygiene rules a mere 35 per cent of the time, the second-worst result among the province's teaching hospitals and well below the provincial average of 62.2 per cent.</p>
<p>The figures were released as CHEO was battling repeated outbreaks of infectious diarrhea, prompting public-health officials to link the low rates of hand-cleaning to the outbreaks. During one of those outbreaks, the spread of the rotavirus, a highly contagious gastro-intestinal bug, was believed to have contributed to the death of a baby who had other underlying illnesses.</p>
<p>The hospital has since worked with public-health officials to identify gaps in its infection-control practices and rolled out a campaign to educate staff and patients' families on hand hygiene.</p>
<p>Among other things, more hand-cleaning stations have been installed around the hospital, and staff have been given training sessions on the new hand-hygiene rules. As well, parents have been given brochures on how to follow proper hand hygiene, and policies have been enforced to restrict the number of visitors to medical wards, Bilodeau said.</p>
<p>The hospital has also produced a series of posters that encourage patients' families to ask physicians and nurses whether they have cleaned their hands before and after treating patients.</p>
<p>Dr. Sonny Dhanani, a critical-care physician at CHEO, said the posters allowed patients' families to feel they had the right to ask doctors and nurses if they had washed their hands.</p>

<p>Could H1N1 be lurking right around the corner? Your iPhone can let you know.</p>
<p>A new interactive iPhone application called Outbreaks Near Me lets users track and report cases of swine flu in real time.Anyone can take photos of events or scenarios they think might indicate or lead to a case of H1N1, then ship them to HealthMap, a service that mines the Internet for data on infectious diseases and outbreaks. Its team of epidemiologists and other public-health experts decide whether the report is cause for concern. If so, it becomes a plot on an influenza map.</p>
<p>The interactive tool, developed by researchers at the Children's Hospital Boston in conjunction with the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is then able to pinpoint reported outbreaks near the user's location using the iPhone's built-in GPS technology. It can also send a notification through an alert or an e-mail when a case crops up nearby. Users can search outbreaks in other areas, too.</p>
<p>Outbreaks Near Me is meant to get the average Joe involved in public-health reporting, says John Brownstein, the Montreal born co-founder of HealthMap. The service has been online since 2006 and was just released as an iPhone app this week.</p>
<p>“The idea is if someone's seeing something strange or unusual happening – like school closure or overcrowded hospitals or a cluster of dead birds that might indicate West Nile … they would report on it,” says Prof. Brownstein, who is also an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Children's Hospital Boston.</p>
<p>But since the app tracks reports from informal sources, it's best not to assume there will be an apocalypse-by-swine-flu if numerous markers turn up in your location.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>With more than 500 aboriginal women missing, action is overdue</b>
</div><div>ANDRE PICARD </div>

</p>
<p>Last week, the Manitoba government announced the creation of a joint RCMP and Winnipeg Police task force to investigate dozens of cases of missing and murdered women in the province.</p>
<p>The news, while welcome, raises the question: Why limit the investigation to Manitoba?</p>
<p>It is true that there are at least 75 missing women in the province, virtually all of them aboriginal. Police have been seemingly incapable of solving the cases and halting the race-based violence.</p>
<p>But, nationwide, the data are even more gut-wrenching: The Native Women's Association of Canada has catalogued 520 cases of missing or murdered aboriginal women, half of them since the year 2000.</p>
<p>The women, most under the age of 30, are overwhelmingly victims of sexual violence. They are being preyed upon systematically by sexual sadists, killers and probably more than one serial killer.</p>
<p>How can this not be considered a national priority for police, justice and public-health officials?</p>
<p>Sadly, when a native woman is murdered or vanishes under suspicious circumstances, it does not mobilize police action nor generate near as much media attention as similar cases involving non-native women.</p>
<p>They were drunk. They were sex workers. They came from unstable family backgrounds. They were runaways. They were party girls. An endless litany of excuses for inaction is trotted out with shocking regularity.</p>
<p>Let's be blunt. The main reason an in-depth investigation is required is that the situation reeks of racism, stereotyping and discrimination. There seems to be a deadly double standard at play.</p>
<p>It is true that many of the 500-plus aboriginal women who have been murdered or disappeared had difficult life circumstances.</p>
<p>But it is precisely these circumstances – alcoholism, drug addiction, sexual abuse, the sequelae of residential schools, poverty, survival sex, etc. – that placed them at much higher risk.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of an aboriginal is a decade less than a non-aboriginal in Canada. The rate of infant mortality is three times higher. The suicide rate is six times higher. Aboriginal people have a rate of diabetes and heart disease three times the national average, and dramatically higher rates of infectious diseases like tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS and H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>The key determinants of health – individually and collectively – are social and economic factors such as housing, income, education, environment and empowerment. First nations, Métis and Inuit communities fare particularly dismally in these essential areas.</p>
<p>Unemployment levels and poverty rates in aboriginal communities are three times higher than in mainstream society. Only 4 per cent of natives have a university education, one quarter the rate in mainstream society. More than one third of aboriginal people in Canada have, in government jargon, a “core housing need,” meaning their homes do not meet the most basic standards of acceptability. Overcrowding, lack of running water and inadequate sewage services are the norm in many native communities.</p>
<p>Not to mention that an aboriginal is five times more likely to be murdered than a non-aboriginal Canadian.</p>
<p>The murder of poor (literally and figuratively) aboriginal women is the most extreme manifestation of the price first nations, Inuit and Métis peoples are paying for the abysmal social conditions in which they are trapped.</p>
<p>The murders are also a gruesome symbol of society's indifference to that plight.</p>
<p>Much was made of the fact that virtually all of mass murderer Robert Pickton's victims were sex workers. But rarely did we hear that almost all his victims were young aboriginal women. There is evidence that a serial killer may also be at work in Manitoba, and a single man may also be responsible for the carnage along British Columbia's infamous Highway of Tears. (The Yellowhead Highway, which stretches 750 kilometres from Prince George to Prince Rupert has been the site of nine murders and disappearances since 1990, all but one of the victims young aboriginal women.) But the reality is that the Highway of Tears stretches from sea-to-sea-to-sea in this country: Aboriginal women have been murdered or disappeared by the score in every single province and territory in Canada.</p>
<p>This is not a Manitoba-only problem.</p>
<p>Beverley Jacobs, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada, has repeatedly called for a national investigation into this on-going horror.</p>
<p>As she noted, the deaths and disappearances of 520 aboriginal women is the equivalent of 18,000 missing and murdered non-aboriginal women.</p>
<p>Would we stand idly by while a massacre of our daughters, sisters, mothers and grandmothers unfolded on this scale?</p>
<p>We would not and we should not.</p>
<p>Incomprehensibly, Ms. Jacobs's call for a national investigation has gone unheeded by the federal government. Instead, politicians have contented themselves with funding research into the problem.</p>
<p>A report published earlier this year, entitled Voices of Our Sisters in Spirit, makes for chilling reading, recounting the stories of many murdered and missing aboriginal women. The data therein are as humbling as they are sickening: More than half the murders of aboriginal women remain unsolved.</p>
<p>It's time to go beyond mere cataloguing of the carnage, and to understand the root causes.</p>
<p>In Canada, a death or a disappearance should not be taken less seriously because of the colour of a person's skin.</p>
<p>And Canadians should not tolerate that the horror of these crimes – 520 daughters, sisters, mothers and grandmothers stolen away from their families, friends and communities – be redoubled by indifference.</p>
<p>Our willful blindness to the plight of aboriginal women is the greatest injustice.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Early maternity leave urged to lower H1N1 risk; Recommended for women who work in daycares, schools and hospitals</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>417 words</div><div>3 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Quebec public health authorities are now recommending that pregnant women who work in daycares, schools and hospitals take advantage of the government's early maternity leave program to reduce the risk of catching the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"Yes, this program exists and yes, women can apply for it - not systematically, as in 'I'm a pregnant woman and a teacher,' but after a discussion with a doctor," said Alain Poirier, national director of the Quebec Public Health Department.</p>
<p>In August, two Quebec City school boards made it a policy to let pregnant women go on preventive leave because they could be exposed to children infected with the swine flu. Initially, government officials left the decision up to each school board.</p>
<p>But medical authorities are now of the opinion that pregnant women shouldn't run the risk, especially since two women who were in their third trimesters have died from H1N1 infections, Poirier said.</p>
<p>He advised all pregnant woman who are suffering from flu-like symptoms to seek medical attention immediately. The medical protocol is for H1N1-infected pregnant women to be treated with anti-viral medications.</p>
<p>Ruth Rosenfield, president of the Montreal Teachers Association, said that the English Montreal School Board received a government directive on Tuesday about preventive maternity leaves.</p>
<p>"Given the elevated risk for pregnant women, I don't know if there really was a whole lot of choice," Rosenfield said. "But waiting around to hear what the government was going to do has been kind of like being on tenterhooks."</p>
<p>The provincial workplace, health and safety board already administers a program called "maternité sans danger" for pregnant women. In order to qualify for early maternity leave, a woman's doctor must make a medical recommendation to stay home. Ultimately, it's the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CSST) that decides to grant the leave and informs the employer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the peak in the number of H1N1 infections occurred in mid-July in Quebec. However, Poirier warned that the province, as well as the rest of the world, will likely be hit with a second wave in the coming months. He said that flu viruses tend to thrive during the cold months.</p>
<p>He added that the province will soon start providing $8 H1N1 flu shots, free of charge, on a voluntary basis.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 a strain on health staff, too; Sickest patients real challenges, hospital board told</b>
</div><div>Zev Singer    </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>As the city waits for the next round of H1N1 infections, Dr. Virginia Roth gave a brief glimpse Wednesday of what the first round looked like inside the Ottawa Hospital's intensive care units.</p>
<p>Roth, director of the hospital's infection prevention and control program, was answering questions at a meeting of the hospital board of governors.</p>
<p>For more than an hour, Roth, Dr. Isra Levy, the city's medical officer of health, and Thomas Hayes, the man responsible for emergency preparedness at the hospital, summarized and explained the planning efforts. The message, as with all things H1N1, was the need to maximize preparedness and minimize hysteria.</p>
<p>At one point, though, Jim Nininger, one of the governors, asked the trio what issues kept them up at night.</p>
<p>Putting aside the charts and infection rate data for a moment, Roth gave a quick look at what the outbreak could feel like inside the place where the very sickest H1N1 patients would come.</p>
<p>Roth said that in June, during the peak of the first wave of H1N1 in Ottawa, she was on call as the infectious disease specialist at the Ottawa Hospital's General campus.</p>
<p>At that time, there were five H1N1 patients in the intensive care unit. Those cases were real challenges for the doctors and nurses, she said.</p>
<p>"The burden was huge in many respects," Roth told the board.</p>
<p>"One is that some of them were young and healthy. These are people that our health care workers are relating to: They're the 36-year-old and 40-year-old."</p>
<p>Two of them were pregnant, she said.</p>
<p>The virus affects most people in only a mild way, Roth said, but those who were seriously affected in June were in need of a "super-ICU" level of care.</p>
<p>"Their lungs were failing to such a degree we had to bring in other technologies that we don't usually use," Roth said.</p>
<p>Doctors and nurses are human, she said, and, despite their training and professionalism, they do relate emotionally to "tragic" cases, such as young people with no other illness getting that sick.</p>
<p>"We had some pregnant health-care workers in the unit and they were relating on an emotional basis to these patients," she said.</p>
<p>She told the board that the emotional strain on the ICU staff proved to be one of the small "stress points" in the first wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>"So I'm thinking, if we double or triple that, it will be a strain. And I'm not saying we're not prepared. We are prepared. I think we just need to be able to identify our stress point early and support to the max, support these areas, emotionally, with supplies, everything we can, to assist them through."</p>
<p>In her answer to Nininger, Roth said she was able to sleep. The ICU picture was only a small snapshot in a much larger context in which most people who get H1N1, so far, have not been very sick.</p>
<p>However, a next round of H1N1 is certain to mean more work and more stress for the ICU workers, amongst others.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't forget to acknowledge that those specially trained people are there if we need them," Roth said, "and we need to thank them for the work that they're doing and I think that goes a long way."</p>

</p>
<p>The BC Centre for Disease Control is fast-tracking studies meant to give health officials a better idea of how many British Columbians are immune to the H1N1 flu virus and why it hits certain age groups harder than others.</p>
<p>One study is screening 1,000 British Columbians for the H1N1 antibody, which will give researchers a strong indication of what percentage of the population is immune to the virus.</p>
<p>There have been recent suggestions a large percentage of British Columbians are already immune to the virus.</p>
<p>But both Dr. Danuta Skowronski, physician epidemiologist with the BCCDC, and Dr. Perry Kendall, chief provincial health officer, said Wednesday those suggestions are overstated and unrealistic.</p>
<p>"Even without doing the survey, we know that the population will not have been saturated already. We know that the majority of the population will still not have immunity to the pandemic H1N1 virus," Skowronski said.</p>
<p>"That's just not how influenza works. We know that even when there's a new variant that's similar to previous variants, it circulates over several years before it finally burns out."</p>
<p>Recent information showed about 800 people in the province had tested positive for the H1N1 virus since May. Kendall says about one out of every 20 cases of the virus is confirmed by lab tests, which would mean about 16,000 people in B.C. have been infected so far.</p>
<p>Of all the people who visited their doctors in May and June with flu-like symptoms and wanted to be tested for H1N1, only about one-third tested positive for the novel virus. Kendall said about 40 per cent of the cases turned out to be "A" strains of human influenza, a few cases were "B" strains, and about 20 per cent were other viruses.</p>
<p>Results from the population immunity survey being done by the BCCDC won't be released until mid-October. Those results will be compared against baseline results from a similar survey conducted in the spring.</p>
<p>Skowronski said no more volunteers are required for the immunity survey, but volunteers in specific age groups are still needed for a different study, which will examine risk factors for the virus according to age.</p>
<p>Volunteers are required to give a blood sample and answer some brief questions. Researchers are still looking for volunteers in the age groups of 39 to 40, 49 to 51, 60 to 64, and 80 to 90.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First Nations want to be first in line for vaccine; Aboriginals most affected so far; key is mobilizing communities: expert</b>
</div><div>Elise Stolte    </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>735 words</div><div>3 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal    </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu vaccine will reach all First Nations reserves this fall, but a successful immunization campaign will depend on leaders mobilizing their communities, a Health Canada official told Alberta chiefs Wednesday.</p>
<p>About 30 people living on reserves in Alberta have contracted the virus so far, but stories of outbreaks on reserves in Manitoba have people here on edge, and many expect the flu to hit the communities hard in the fall.</p>
<p>First Nations leaders in Eastern Canada advocated for their communities to be prioritized when the vaccine becomes available, since aboriginal people have so far been more seriously affected.</p>
<p>But whether the communities get the vaccine in week one or two is not going to matter as much as how well the chiefs and leaders can mobilize their communities when it comes, Herman Wierenga, regional director with First Nations and Inuit Health, told the chiefs Wednesday.</p>
<p>Residents, especially the young, need to get the shots, likely in two instalments.</p>
<p>"Those youth aren't exactly used to getting a flu shot. We can't lasso them in there," he said.</p>
<p>Chiefs and councils from across Alberta gathered in Edmonton this week to elect a new regional chief for the national Assembly of First Nations. They discussed H1N1 preparedness and passed a series of resolutions before an all-candidates forum. The election is scheduled for today.</p>
<p>Health Canada has been working with each First Nation to develop emergency and pandemic plans for the past several years, although many need to be updated.</p>
<p>"This isn't just about a health issue," Wierenga said. "It's how do you maintain essential services."</p>
<p>If the manager of the water treatment centre, teachers or those who clear the roads get sick, "who are your backup people for your essential services?"</p>
<p>On the positive side, he said, last week 32 First Nations participated in a video-conferenced workshop on H1N1 preparedness. The technology to keep updated is in place, Wierenga said.</p>
<p>"We're in very good shape as far as connectivity."</p>
<p>Rose Laboucan, chief of Driftpile First Nation, said she still needs to be assured the federal and provincial governments are communicating so her people can count on getting beds at local hospitals.</p>
<p>Her community is busy updating its emergency plans, but she already knows the five vans the band owns to take residents without transportation to doctors visits would quickly be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The last elders who helped bury the dead during the last pandemic, the Spanish flu, have long since passed on.</p>
<p>But the mass grave just outside the townsite is still a clear reminder of how serious the flu can be.</p>
<p>"The federal government is saying we're ready, we're prepared, but no one has any idea of what the magnitude of H1N1 is going to be. No one can ever be prepared for the unknown," she said.</p>
<p>"Let's say 60 per cent of my population was infected. How can you accommodate that?There's no way to be prepared."</p>
<p>Eddy Makokis, chief of the Saddle Lake Cree Nation and grand chief of Treaty 6, said he was recently assured jurisdictional issues won't stop the vaccine from getting to the reserves, which was a relief.</p>
<p>"We're trying to educate the membership. Make sure they wash their hands, cough into their arms," he said, but he knows containment will be a problem where most homes have between eight and 16 residents.</p>
<p>The band is still trying to plan how to ensure residents keep themselves quarantined when necessary, and who will bring them food and water. He still doesn't know how members will react to the vaccine, since they've had low turnouts for flu immunization campaigns in the past.</p>
<p>"But I think there's a scare," he said. "There'll be a bigger turnout for this one."</p>

<p>Alberta Health Services is prepared to go over budget to ensure patients get the care they need when the expected H1N1 flu pandemic hits this fall, CEO and president Stephen Duckett says.</p>
<p>"Depending on its severity, we may need to alter our current budget strategies for reducing costs in the health-care system in order to ensure we are fully prepared to deal with the pandemic," he told the Fort Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Health Services spent $3.9 million to purchase 106 ventilators, boosting the number to 506, in anticipation of a pandemic that is expected to hit intensive care units particularly hard, filling them with patients with serious respiratory conditions who need mechanical help to breathe.</p>
<p>The new ventilators will begin arriving later this month with the final units expected by mid-October.</p>
<p>Although the price tag was $2 million lower than expected-- the province negotiated a three-year provincewide contract, and used money from pre-existing project equipment budgets--Duckett said he's prepared to spend more if the situation requires.</p>
<p>That, despite the health system's current penny-pinching endeavour as it faces a$1-billion deficit. It wants to find three per cent in savings by offering early retirement packages to nurses and other health-care workers, as well as having its long-term care and Catholic hospital partners find ways to cut.</p>
<p>"Alberta Health Services is committed to taking swift action (against the H1N1 pandemic) to successfully address the variety of current and future risks facing our province," Duckett said.</p>
<p>A provincewide series of presentations is beginning in northern Alberta, where doctors and experts will provide advice to schools, municipalities and businesses on how to approach the pandemic emergency.</p>
<p>"We will also explore the option of scaling back non-essential work, for example, by delaying elective surgery to free up staff and resources to handle H1N1 cases," Duckett said, noting he gets updates on the situation every Tuesday.</p>
<p>He recently talked with people in the Australian state of Victoria, which has about 20 per cent more people than Alberta and has already seen the flu's increase during winter. The state needed to create another 10 to 20 beds in intensive care to accommodate the patient crunch.</p>
<p>"Although the admissions to hospitals are roughly the same as ordinary flu, the admissions to ICU intensive care units are much greater, and so we're preparing just in case the same happens here," Duckett said. Hospital stays also tend to be longer with this flu strain.</p>
<p>"We might need to rapidly expand our intensive-care capacity."</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said the regular flu strain typically makes five to 10 per cent of the population sick.</p>
<p>He said he expects 15 to 20 per cent of people will get sick when the second H1N1 wave hits this fall, since few have immunity. In the end, he said up to 35 per cent of the population could get sick over the flu season.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Garden Olympics; Yards are sucked clean in the hunt for gold</b>

</p>
<p>If golf can become an Olympic sport, why not gardening? The model is already in place: Hamilton's Trillium Awards.</p>
<p>I spent a day with a bunch of Trillium judges, trying to pick the gold medal garden in the city. It's actually called the Red Trillium, the silver medallist wins the Pink, and the bronze gets a White.</p>
<p>You have to be fit to judge because you leap in and out of a van to view 18 gardens in one day. You have to be quick, no lingering over a hosta to determine if it's Golden Prayers or Golden Tiara.</p>
<p>You have to be as ruthless as a figure skating judge. "Did you see that fake topiary," gasped one judge. "The view down that arbour is a mess," sniffed another.</p>
<p>I feel for those poor people who qualify for a Red Trillium. They only know that sometime during a certain week the judges will be marching around their front yard, notebooks poised, white gloves ready to detect dust on the dahlias and magnifying glasses looking for slug trails.</p>
<p>The plants looked petrified, and the people, well, we never saw them. Once in a while a curtain would snap shut in a front room, as if the poor occupant had just seen the tax collector steaming up the front steps.</p>
<p>Unlike the Olympics, drugs are allowed. The preferred elixir must be Miracle-Gro judging by the girth and gusto of the annuals I saw. Muscular geraniums were everywhere with varieties such as A-Rod, Man-Ram and the old but enduring Ben Johnson the most popular.</p>
<p>Not far into the morning I started to keep my mouth shut because the gardens I liked were not Olympic calibre. We passed one on Blake Street that seemed to have a circus, amusement park, Six Flags sort of flair to it. Just as I was about to say "how interesting," one of the judges cut me off with, "that's offensive."</p>
<p>To be in the hunt for gold at the Trilliums, a garden has to be sucked clean and seamless, like the stretched tight faces of synchro swimmers. If earth is showing, it must be free of twigs, stems, and please, earthworms get back in your holes!</p>
<p>The grass, oh my, is where it gets very competitive. A stray leaf? Five points off. A brown edge? Better luck next year. Crabgrass, clover? No treat for you Red Rover.</p>
<p>Shrubs must be separated. The judges really grooved on gardens where shrubs grew like islands, as if they had H1N1 and were in quarantine.</p>
<p>Gardeners hoping to qualify for the Trillium Olympics must show proficiency in pruning, leaf blowing, edging and weed whacking. Careless use of a rotary mower is an automatic deduction.</p>
<p>Artistry was rarely discussed, except for the sudden snort of derision over gnomes, plastic swans and stepping-stones shaped like Bigfoot. No ornament shall come from Walmart.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there were some nice landscapes, and once in a while a good garden, and the Trilliums do promote civic beautification in a Mrs. Cleaver sort of way.</p>
<p>But the Red Trillium finalists I saw didn't glow with the sort of passion I've seen in the lower ranked White Trillium category.</p>
<p>My neighbours Bill Curran and Maryanne Scime won a White Trillium. Their front yard is a meadow of lavender and thyme. On a hot summer night the fragrance is pure France. Wine can be enjoyed there, the shrubs touch and earthworms are welcome.</p>
<p>That's my Olympic ideal.</p>

</p>
<p>As the Opposition challenged the Liberals in the legislature Wednesday over what they knew about the province's deteriorating finances and when they knew it, the premier and the minister of finance presented an interesting study.</p>
<p>Gordon Campbell and Colin Hansen gave close-to-identical answers.</p>
<p>Yes, both were told during the election campaign that revenues were "off." But they were also assured that the budget they'd tabled in February was still "doable." Therefore no need to tell the public about the tanking revenues.</p>
<p>The answers sounded scripted. And from where I sat in the legislative press gallery, the Liberal duo appeared to be working from a common text, set in large type with key passages highlighted for ease of reading.</p>
<p>Indeed, on several occasions when it was Hansen's turn to answer, Campbell plunked down a page in front of him and jabbed a finger at the relevant passage, as if to say, "Here's your line -- now read it."</p>
<p>Ever the dutiful servant, Hansen did so.</p>
<p>One couldn't have asked for a better illustration of the premier's controlling tendencies and the willingness of most ministers to indulge them. All that was missing was the follow-up pat on the head, signaling that Hansen had performed as expected.</p>
<p>I thought back to all those months that Hansen stuck by the $600-million-and-not-a-penny-more estimate of the cost of staging the Olympics, never mind that everyone but him seemed to know that the budget was long since busted over the soaring cost of security.</p>
<p>"Why does he risk his credibility like that?" I remember asking one of Hansen's admirers in the cabinet ranks. Because the premier insisted, I was told.</p>
<p>Hansen's good-guy reputation survived the eventual backdown on the Olympic budget. But he's in deeper trouble in the current budget furore, with the triple whammy over the HST, spending cuts and the deficit.</p>
<p>The latter concern was not helped by his latest admission. During an interview with Bill Good on CKNW radio Wednesday, Hansen said he'd learned right after the election that revenues were running $1.1 billion behind budget expectations.</p>
<p>This according to a briefing from finance ministry staff on May 14, just six weeks into the financial year. And much higher than the $200 million to $300 million that had been reported to him during the campaign.</p>
<p>Still, the dramatic slide in revenues didn't prompt Hansen to revise the Liberal budget. On the contrary, when he was reappointed to cabinet in the shuffle on June 10, he was still calling it doable.</p>
<p>"If I were in a position to table a budget today it would be a deficit of $495 million or less," Hansen told reporters. "I am still confident that we will be able to deliver on that."</p>
<p>He's known for almost a month that revenues are off by more than $1 billion and he's still sticking by that dubious deficit projection. Why? asked interviewer Good.</p>
<p>That set Hansen to another display of verbal ducking and dodging that was (as one observer noted) reminiscent of Yogi Bear trying to explain to Ranger Smith what happened to the picnic basket.</p>
<p>Hansen said after hearing the news on May 14, he WAS worried about not being able to hit the deficit target. But toward the end of that month he learned that B.C. might be able to move to a harmonized sales tax, with its accompanying $1.6-billion federal transition funding.</p>
<p>Whereupon he stopped worrying long enough to make his pronouncement on June 10. Then on June 24 the federal government advised the province that it would be getting far less than budgeted-for income and corporate taxes and he started worrying again.</p>
<p>By that point in the recitation, I was worrying about the minister's mood swings. Has he considered lithium?</p>
<p>One also had to wonder why the Liberals were engaging in this clumsy round of disclosure, given that it was doing them more harm than good.</p>
<p>The best guess is that it has something do with a flood of applications under access-to-information legislation from the Opposition and various news organizations. Each seeks internal documentation from the pre-election period regarding the decision to adopt the HST and the deteriorating financial situation.</p>
<p>Those applications aren't likely to elicit any written evidence that the Liberals were readying the HST switch before voting day. Not even a note scrawled on a napkin, according to what I've been told.</p>
<p>The budget queries are more likely to bear fruit. The finance ministry tracks changes in the province's financial situation on a weekly and even a daily basis. Finance officials are meticulous record-keepers. Access to information could eventually provide considerable documentation on the downward slide in revenues.</p>
<p>By getting out the news now, Hansen perhaps hopes to defuse a bigger bombshell down the road. But his somewhat forced display of candour has overshadowed any good points in the budget and further damaged the government's credibility.</p>
<p>vpalmer@shawlink.ca</p>
<p>ANATOMY OF A DEFICIT: HOW A PROJECTED $495-MILLION DEFICIT BALLOONED TO $2.8 BILLION.</p>
<p>Jan. 23: Then-deputy finance minister Chris Trumpy delivers new revenue projections to Finance Minister Colin Hansen. Liberals had insisted for months there would be no deficit.</p>
<p>Jan. 24: Premier Gordon Campbell, Hansen and senior staff meet in Courtenay after a memorial for Stan Hagen and, because of those projections, decide for the first time they must run a deficit.</p>
<p>Feb. 2: Campbell announces: "The changes we've seen have come too fast, they've been too big for me to honestly say to you that we can credibly present a balanced budget on Feb. 17 without doing significant harm to critical health services and essential education services."</p>
<p>Feb. 9: Liberals table a bill allowing the government to override its own balanced budget budget legislation and to run deficits in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 fiscal years.</p>
<p>Feb. 17: Hansen introduces a budget, projecting a $495-million deficit for 2009-10, and a $245-million deficit for 2010-11.</p>
<p>April 14: B.C. election campaign officially begins.</p>
<p>April 15: According to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Hansen had a call at 10:30 a.m. with deputy finance minister Graham Whitmarsh and deputy secretary to treasury board Nick Paul. It is not clear what was discussed during this call.</p>
<p>April 23: After a radio debate, Campbell makes a firm promise on the budget. "If we are re-elected, that [the February budget] will be pretty much the budget that's reintroduced. We may not have quite as much contingency, but I can tell you this: the deficit for 2009-10 will be $495 million maximum."</p>
<p>Late April/EARly may: In this timeframe, Hansen says Whitmarsh told him at the end of a call that revenues were down by about $200 to $300 million.</p>
<p>May 7: According to his own account, Campbell has a meeting with his deputy minister Jessica McDonald to discuss H1N1. "At that time she told me there were financial pressures," he said. "She had also been informed by the deputy minister of finance there were a number of measures he felt he could take that would allow us to meet our February budget."</p>
<p>May 12: Campbell's Liberal government wins re-election. The same day, finance ministry officials complete an analysis showing B.C. revenues are down by $1.1 billion from what was expected.</p>
<p>May 14: Campbell, Hansen and possibly others meet with Whitmarsh at the Vancouver cabinet offices and are told of the $1.1-billion shortfall. Campbell said he told finance officials at the time: "We have a budget we're trying to meet. You'd better go back and try to find areas where we can act, and what we can do and how we can meet the [February] budget."</p>
<p>May 25: Hansen attends a meeting of federal and provincial finance ministers in Quebec, where the idea of moving to adopt the HST appears to have first taken hold. Hansen said in late May federal officials told him Ottawa was willing to be more flexible on the terms of the HST, and that they were willing to offer the province an incentive payment of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>June 10: After he is sworn in to a new term as finance minister, Hansen tells reporters the $495-million deficit figure is still doable. Hansen would later reveal that at the time he thought the drop in provincial revenues could be offset by a $1.6-billion payment from Ottawa to implement the HST.</p>
<p>June 24: Federal finance officials advise provincial officials that B.C. will get significantly less than budgeted in personal and corporate income tax revenues.</p>
<p>June 25: Whitmarsh breaks news of the revenue drop to Hansen.</p>
<p>June 29: Hansen makes his first public comment hinting at the news from Ottawa: "I was more confident about [holding to a $495-million deficit] two weeks ago." He said government took a big hit on June 25, but would not divulge how much or what effect it would have on the budget.</p>
<p>July 9: Delivering public accounts, Hansen speaks more definitively about the blown deficit target: "Given what I know today, I am not optimistic at all that a $495-million [deficit] number is anywhere near possible."</p>
<p>July 23: Liberals announce the HST.</p>
<p>Aug. 19: Hansen tells reporters that projected revenues have plunged more than $2 billion since February, and that social welfare and forest firefighting costs are on a dramatic rise.</p>
<p>Aug. 20: Hansen tells reporters the government will need to amend its own laws to allow it to run a deficit for four years, instead of two.</p>
<p>Sept. 1: Hansen introduces a $2.8-billion deficit for 2009-10.</p>

<p>Re: Are We Ready? Aug. 29.</p>
<p>Please accept my congratulations and, respectfully, my thanks on the H1N1 special edition published in this past weekend's Citizen.</p>
<p>The package the Citizen editorial and writing team put together is thoughtful and informative and, I believe, of great value and help for the reader.</p>
<p>My colleagues in the public health field are sensitive to the need and desire for public education and information on matters like pH1N1, and we recognize the important and effective role the media plays in informing citizens abut matters related to their well-being. This coverage heartens us as we move forward into the fall and continue to rely on the news media to assist us in keeping citizens informed.</p>
<p>Once again, I congratulate the Citizen on an outstanding edition with great depth and breadth and a nuanced and balanced approach to a very complex subject. I believe it serves the public interest well.</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy,</p>

<p>An intensive-care doctor speaking Wednesday at a conference on the H1N1 pandemic said the virus is the "most frightening" thing he has seen in his career -- and other experts here warned hospitals are not ready for a surge of severely sick patients.</p>
<p>In an interview before his address, Dr. Anand Kumar said he wanted to give the audience "the flavour" of what hospitals can expect from the second wave of the pandemic, expected this fall and winter.</p>
<p>"I think it's an absolutely massive onslaught of incredibly sick young people that I had never imagined I would see in my life," Kumar said of his experience treating patients in Winnipeg's intensive-care units. "It's startling, and more than a little frightening, especially when you don't know what the ceiling of this is going to be."</p>
<p>The two-day conference, which has drawn together about 150 health-care professionals and experts from across the country and around the world, is focused on how to manage severe cases of the swine flu and prevent them from deteriorating. The sessions are closed to media.</p>
<p>Most cases of swine flu in Canada have been mild, but there is a subset of patients who are getting very sick. The virus differs from other flu bugs, attacking younger people at disproportionately higher rates.</p>
<p>Kumar said, of the patients who were hospitalized in Winnipeg, two-thirds were young, healthy people who were "essentially struck down in the prime of their life" and hospitals were filled with "rows and rows" of patients in their 20s, 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical-care specialist and associate professor at the University of Toronto, said the second wave is not going to hit every city at the same time and jurisdictions should be able to share resources. Those plans are not yet ready to be activated, said Fowler, and hospitals in general are not ready for high numbers of swine flu patients to walk through their doors.</p>
<p>"Are we ready? I think lots of work has been done, but we're not ready," said Fowler. "There's still lots more work to be done over the next weeks to months."</p>

<p>As public-health authorities warn about a possible second wave of H1N1 infections, school officials across the West Island are preparing for any flu outbreak this fall.</p>
<p>While Lester B. Pearson officials have opted not to install hand sanitizers in their schools, students at West Island CEGEPs will have no problem keeping their hands disinfected as the hand sanitizers have been installed across campuses at John Abbott, Vanier and CEGEP Gérald Godin.</p>
<p>Marcus Tabachnick, head of the Lester. B. Pearson School Board, said board officials are very much aware they are responsible for a large community of people: 30,000-plus students, 4,000 teachers and thousands of volunteers.</p>
<p>"We have in place a very comprehensive pandemic plan which was updated last year," Tabachnick said. "We will be reminding everyone to make sure they have good health habits and will be on the lookout for symptoms."</p>
<p>Tabachnick said that, as in the past, any student with a fever is sent home once it is ascertained there is someone responsible waiting for them at home.</p>
<p>"That has always been the case, not just for this flu."</p>
<p>He said the board's website - www.lbpsb.qc.ca[http://www.lbpsb.qc.ca] - will update its influenza information link.</p>
<p>A school board official said the installation of hand sanitizers was not considered at schools this year as they can be misused, especially at the grade school level.</p>

<p>Majority of Canadians see no risk of H1N1 flu from eating pork</p>
<p>A new poll suggests an overwhelming majority of Canadians understand they can't get the H1N1 virus from eating pork, despite the early labelling of the illness as "swine flu." The Harris-Decima survey found just six per cent of respondents felt they could get the flu from handling or eating pork, while 90 per cent said there is no such risk. The poll also found that 87 per cent of respondents say they're eating just as many pork products as before the flu outbreak.</p>

<p>Federal Fisheries Minister Gail Shea says fishermen could have been given more notice of a ban on shellfish in the Maritimes. Shea admits that her department and Environment Canada could have consulted with people in the industry before the restriction on certain shellfish was issued Monday. The ban was imposed because of concerns about the potential for increased bacterial levels brought on by heavy rains over the weekend.</p>

<p>For the second time this week, border agents in Buffalo say they've found a big load of marijuana in a commercial truck coming from Canada. Customs and Border Protection officials say an X-ray of a truck Wednesday led them to 76 kilograms of marijuana concealed in paint additive. The driver, a 38-year-old Brampton man was arrested on federal charges of importation and possession of a controlled substance. On Monday, agents reported finding 160 kilograms of marijuana hidden in a shipment of firewood. The driver, a 40-year-old citizen of India living in Canada, also faces federal charges.</p>

The Ministry of Tourism directed the Parks Commission to revisit the 25-year renewal given to the Maid of the Mist Steamboat Co. Ontario's integrity commissioner cleared commission chair Jim Williams of any wrongdoing in renewing the contract after a complaint from another parks commissioner, Bob Gale. Gale objected to the fact that the lease was renewed without putting the contract out to tender.</p>

At least 23 victims may have been bilked out of $6.5 million by a local financial adviser over almost a decade, police said. The man, who is not being named, would approach an individual, offer to invest money in fictitious investments such as GICs and mutual funds, but use the money for his own purposes. The alleged fraudster appeared to target seniors in the Winnipeg area.</p>

</p>
<p>The NDP leadership race officially kicked off Wednesday with a rising party star announcing his candidacy.</p>
<p>However, a week after Gary Doer stunned the province -- and his party -- with the news that he was stepping down after a decade as premier, the field of candidates who will vie to replace him is still largely unknown.</p>
<p>Andrew Swan, a lawyer who has held the relatively junior portfolio of Competitiveness, Trade and Training for the past year and a half, became the first to take the plunge, announcing he will run to succeed Doer as leader at a convention in Winnipeg Oct. 17.</p>
<p>The five-year MLA has considerable caucus support, with a half-dozen members attending his announcement at the West End Cultural Centre Wednesday, including three cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two party heavyweights, considered top-flight contenders, bowed out of the race Wednesday, while several other potential front-runners, including Finance Minister Greg Selinger, kept their silence.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald announced she would not run because of family reasons and her commitment to guiding the government's response to a looming H1N1 flu pandemic. Her decision makes it unlikely that a high-profile female candidate will contest the leadership.</p>
<p>Family Services Minister Gord Mackintosh, who was the focus of intense internal lobbying over the weekend to consider running, also confirmed Wednesday that he will not be a candidate.</p>
<p>That could leave the race for leader as a competition between Swan, Selinger and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Steve Ashton, who is also believed to be interested in running.</p>
<p>"You've heard Gary Doer say he's not a sprinter, he's a marathoner. I can understand that better than most," said Swan, who has run half-marathons.</p>
<p>"I'm not a sprinter either... but I think I can get the job done for today, for tomorrow and for the long term as we work together to build a better province."</p>
<p>Swan, who resigned his cabinet post Wednesday, presented himself as someone who is open to ideas and who will build upon the centrist foundation laid down by Doer.</p>
<p>"Frankly, if I'm leader of this party and premier of this province, I don't care where you come from, I don't care which party allegiance you may hold or what you may have said or done. If you have a good idea, we're prepared to listen, if you're interested in building a better province."</p>
<p>Among the caucus members standing behind Swan Wednesday were five female caucus colleagues: Oswald, Labour Minister Nancy Allan, Erin Selby (Southdale), Sharon Blady (Kirkfield Park) and Bonnie Korzeniowski (St. James).</p>
<p>Allan, who co-chaired Gary Doer's campaign for the leadership 21 years ago, said she is "broken-hearted" that no prominent women appear to be vying for the leadership.</p>
<p>"We thought that this was going to be our time," she told reporters. But she said Swan has shown himself to be supportive of gender issues as a cabinet colleague.</p>
<p>She also said he is a "calm" influence who is unlikely to stir up old animosities between business and labour.</p>
<p>Blady, a member of the Class of '85 at Silver Heights Collegiate along with Swan and Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen, said Swan, 41, brought "compassion and integrity" to his 14-year family law practice before entering politics, and he represents the NDP's "next generation."</p>
<p>Oswald, who has a son who will turn four next month, said the timing of the leadership race wasn't right for her.</p>
<p>"It's just not the time to be walking away from this portfolio," the health minister said.</p>
<p>Mackintosh, who said Wednesday he is "leaning" towards supporting Swan in the leadership race, did not covet the party leadership, preferring a role of "team-building and mentorship" within government.</p>
<p>"That's my groove, and, if I'm allowed, I'd like to continue to fulfil that kind of role on the team here."</p>

<p>The Andrew Swan file:</p>
<p>Personal: The 41-year-old lawyer was born and raised in Winnipeg and attended Silver Heights Collegiate. He and his wife Tamsin have daughters aged nine and 11.</p>

<p>DAVID Harper's first job as the new grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, an organization representing 30 First Nations in northern Manitoba, is preparing for the second outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>Harper, chief of Garden Hill First Nation, was elected Wednesday as grand chief at the 28th annual MKO assembly at Opaskwayak Cree Nation near The Pas. He takes the position immediately.</p>
<p>"It was a very humbling moment," Harper said shortly after he was installed. He replaces Sydney Garrioch, who served as grand chief for six years.</p>
<p>Harper said his first task is getting communities ready to deal with what many fear will be a more serious H1N1 flu outbreak this fall.</p>
<p>Harper has been critical of how governments have so far handled the issue after his community was hit hard in the spring. He has demanded public officials ensure enough antiviral medication is available in First Nation communities.</p>
<p>He has also demanded government make plans to have planes on standby to fly out patients who are seriously sick, and to have doctors ready to spend weeks at a time in the communities during flu season.</p>
<p>As grand chief, he wants to get the MKO's women's council involved in planning what other steps need to be taken to prepare for flu season.</p>
<p>He also wants to promote more business opportunities for northern First Nations, including mining, forestry and tourism.</p>
<p>Harper said more needs to be done to help older children continue with education and training.</p>
<p>He will serve as grand chief for three years.</p>

<p>Alberta has bought 106 ventilator units to be used at hospitals and clinics around the province as it prepares for a resurgence of the H1N1 virus this fall.</p>
<p>The first wave of the virus this past spring exposed a shortfall in national pandemic planning. A lack of ventilators to assist flu-stricken lungs prompted the federal and provincial governments to look into increasing their supplies.</p>
<p>Alberta will start receiving its ventilators in two weeks. It has about 400 ventilators already in place across the province, its health department said yesterday.</p>
<p>Health officials have noted that the H1N1 virus differs from seasonal influenza in three key ways: its victims have been younger, they have been sicker, and they've needed more time on ventilators.</p>
<p>There has been no official tally of the machines in Canada. The federal public health agency told The Globe and Mail this summer there was no point in counting those not attached to critical-care beds because a ventilator needs trained personnel to operate it.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- Canada will have a pandemic vaccine by early next month, and could speed up delivery to Canadians if the swine-flu virus turns more severe in the fall, the country's chief public-health officer says.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones's comments run contrary to the federal government's insistence that Canadians should not expect to be immunized until mid-November, and follow a rash of criticism that Canada is lagging behind other countries in vaccine delivery.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association Journal took a swipe at Ottawa this week, accusing it of delaying the rollout of the H1N1 vaccine. The governments of Australia, the United States and several European countries are planning to immunize their citizens with a vaccine starting in October.</p>
<p>But Health Canada's decision to fortify vaccine with adjuvants – chemical boosters that can increase production – will mire the vaccine in a time-consuming regulatory process, the CMAJ said in an editorial.</p>
<p>But Dr. Butler-Jones insisted yesterday that the timing for approving an adjuvant vaccine would be the same as a non-adjuvant drug. Rolling out the vaccine in mid-November appears to be a more cautious stand.</p>
<p>“We will have vaccine available in early October produced. The question is do we have enough information to be comfortable with immunizing at that point or not? If the next phase of the pandemic comes much earlier than we expect, or is much more severe than we've seen, then that changes the equation,” Dr. Butler-Jones said in an interview.</p>
<p>“If we've got reasonable data on safety and effectiveness and we're seeing a worsening disease, then we can move up when we start immunizing, if that's appropriate.”</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50 million doses from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which is contracted to produce the vaccine for all Canadians. While other countries are rolling out non-adjuvant vaccine for high-risk groups, Canada has decided to blanket the country with an adjuvant vaccine.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons behind Canada's strategy is that non-adjuvant vaccine didn't work as well in the clinical trials in protecting people against the H5N1 avian flu strain. Adjuvants are in many common vaccines in Canada, but have not previously been approved for influenza vaccines.</p>
<p>Critics have suggested Canada roll out a non-adjuvant vaccine much earlier to vulnerable groups, including children, pregnant women and aboriginal communities. They also say the reason for the initial mid-November timeline for the vaccine is because Ottawa was slow off the mark in placing an order with GSK, and its regulators are overly cautious.</p>
<p>“We don't know when H1N1 is going to hit but … [we] have to be ready for the worst-case situation,” Liberal MP Marc Garneau said. “At the moment, because of regulatory processes with this government, because they haven't really realized the urgency of what is happening, it is possible that H1N1 could hit us early and high-risk patients will not have access to this very important vaccine.”</p>
<p>Attending a conference in Winnipeg on the virus, Dr. Butler-Jones said the criticism that Canada is not prepared for a resurgence of the virus this fall is unfounded. He said production has begun for the H1N1 vaccine, now that the seasonal-flu vaccine is ready and being shipped across the country.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>UVic aims to snare rabbits on campus; Wanted: Proposals to trap, sterilize and ship critters out</b>
</div><div>Jeff Bell </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>681 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>A rabbit roundup could be the next step in the University of Victoria's long-running quest to control the burgeoning bunny population on campus.</p>
<p>UVic officials are seeking proposals for a pilot project that calls for at least 150 of the floppy-eared scoundrels to be trapped, sterilized and then adopted out to homes this fall.</p>
<p>The move is the latest step by the university to deal with the damage done by the cute creatures, which roam campus in the hundreds, if not thousands, and have become its unofficial mascot.</p>
<p>Last September, UVic launched a public awareness campaign about the folly of abandoning pet rabbits, and planted thorny and indigenous plants that don't make cushy nesting sites or tasty snacks. In 2007, it formed a task force with neighbouring residents to tackle the problem; in 2006, it built a $10,000 fence around Finnerty Gardens to protect its prize-winning rhododendrons.</p>
<p>And yet rabbits being rabbits, their numbers keep on growing.</p>
<p>"We tried a very strong media blitz -- don't abandon, don't feed, don't harass -- and a year on what we're seeing is that there are more rabbits than before," said Richard Piskor, UVic's director of occupational health, safety and environment, who handles the bunny file.</p>
<p>"We're seeing that there still is feeding going on. The more you feed, the more they procreate and the more rabbits you get, so what's happened is they're being driven up to an unsustainable level."</p>
<p>The university's decision to trap the bunnies focuses on health and safety concerns. "They can carry any and all kinds of things, whether it be parasites, or viral or bacterial disease. We've got such a strong hand-washing campaign going on with H1N1, but I see people taking their little kids to campus and feeding the bunnies and trying to pet them. It just isn't the way to go."</p>
<p>In particular, the university is concerned about its playing fields because rabbits leave potentially infectious droppings and have been digging burrows that pose a danger of tripping and injury to athletes.</p>
<p>"We've got a fairly significant load of feces on those fields, and we've got athletes who may have cuts or abrasions or whatever else," Piskor said. adding that rabbit bites are another problem.</p>
<p>Piskor said various groups could take on the rabbit-control task.</p>
<p>"There have been a variety of different animal-rescue and rabbit-rescue groups, I'm not sure how formal or informal they are. This is really an opportunity for these groups to step forward and work collaboratively with local veterinarians, for example, and come up with what I think would be a creative community solution to this."</p>
<p>Although Victoria General Hospital started shooting rabbits on its grounds in 1999 to bring the population under control, Piskor said any sort of lethal means of control would be considered only if all other reasonable measures were to fail.</p>
<p>In the past, other solutions have been proposed, including a tongue-in-cheek article in a student newsletter last March describing how to kill, clean and cook the creatures.</p>
<p>The concept of sterilizing rabbits was previously put forward by veterinarian Dr. Nick Shaw, who proposed giving vasectomies to male rabbits and then releasing them back in the area they were captured. The idea was that the rabbits would remain territorial and chase away intruding males.</p>
<p>Shaw said he sees potential difficulty in finding 150 homes for rabbits, and in preventing more rabbits from migrating to areas after they have been cleared out.</p>
<p>Proposals for the rabbit-control project must be submitted by 2 p.m. on Sept. 18. Call John Braybrook at 250-721-8332 or go to http://web.uvic.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/purc/sourcing.rfp.php [http://web.uvic.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/purc/sourcing.rfp.php].</p>

</p>
<p>Was going to start this by saying that I don't like to say "I told you so," but that would be a lie.</p>
<p>Truth is, I like it a lot. Don't get a chance to do it much, because I'm not right that often.</p>
<p>But harken back to the column that ran after Budget Day in February: "Maybe it's cynicism, maybe it's the fraidy-cat walking up my spine, but I can't shake this nagging worry that we won't see the real provincial budget until a few months after this May's election. That's when Finance Minister Colin Hansen will rip off his Mr. Nice Guy mask, do the 'bwa-ha-ha-ha' Dr. Evil laugh, and tell us that this Deficit Lite business, in which B.C. dips just a little bit into the red for a mere two years, ain't good enough."</p>
<p>Sure enough, when the real, post-election budget came out yesterday, the numbers were nastier than a Jon and Kate marathon: Four years of deficits, with the shortfall hitting $2.8 billion this year alone.</p>
<p>That's in contrast to the $495 million deficit forecast in February, a figure that Gordon Campbell stubbornly stuck to through the spring election campaign, even as the economic indicators pointed toward the ditch.</p>
<p>In Hansen's defence, the February budget came with an asterisk, government and independent forecasters all acknowledging the volatility of the economy made their revenue projections more of a best guess than an estimate made in confidence. As the year unfolded, the numbers came in sadder than a country song, income taxes and resource revenue falling more than $2 billion short of what was expected.</p>
<p>But some items on the other side of the ledger appeared wonky from the outset. The budget only allowed for an additional 5,000 welfare cases, when common sense said those numbers would climb as people's employment insurance eligibility ran out -- something acknowledged with a three-year, $420 million injection yesterday.</p>
<p>The 2010 Games security budget was obviously based on nothing more than wishful thinking; the federal government is on the hook for the extra expense, but the province will now increase its share of Olympics infrastructure costs by $165 million to offset some of Ottawa's bill.</p>
<p>The bottom line is a deficit six times as high in September as the one expected in February.</p>
<p>Which leads to the obvious question:</p>
<p>With the February numbers so far off, why should we believe the government now?</p>
<p>Well, the political factor is largely gone. The Liberals were returned with a majority in May. Campbell could walk down Douglas Street shooting puppies right now, and there's nothing the voters could do about it until 2013, when the next election will be held. There's no political gain in massaging the numbers -- though Hansen argues that there was, in fact, no massaging before the election, either; he says it wasn't until mid-May that the grimness of the revenue reality became known.</p>
<p>If the projections do hold true, it will be a long time before government opens the wallet again. In fact, if you think this year's budget is tough, wait until the one next February.</p>
<p>Masked by the falling revenue numbers is the fact that government spending is up five per cent in this year's budget, the jump due to more money thrown at everything from health (as usual), to forest fires (as is sometimes usual), to the H1N1 virus (which no one saw coming) and infrastructure (don't you hate that word?).</p>
<p>The real squeeze will come in 2010-11, when the province intends to hold its spending increase to an eensy-teensy half a per cent, which it might just be able to do through a combination of a public sector wage freeze, low interest rates and, perhaps, the sale of cabinet ministers' kidneys, which is what it might take to hit the target. The Liberals seem determined to avoid the experience of the 1980s and 1990s, when it took several years of deficits to pull out of relatively short-term economic nosedives.</p>
<p>If it works, they can say, "I told you so."</p>

<p>Health budget increases 18 per cent over three years to $15.7 billion</p>
<p>Civil service will shrink by five per cent over the next three years, mostly through attrition; one per cent of employees may be laid off</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The B.C. government unveiled the largest deficit in its history yesterday as part of a grim economic update that showed provincial revenues in free fall and the economy performing worse than expected.</p>
<p>The province is forecasting a $2.8-billion deficit this year -- six times higher than what was predicted in the last budget in February. If the figure holds, it will surpass the $2.6 billion deficit in 2002-03.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Colin Hansen said his latest budget assumes the province is at its lowest point in the economic downturn, but acknowledged B.C. is "not out of the woods yet."</p>
<p>Unemployment is higher than expected, housing starts are down, natural gas prices are at record lows, consumer spending has decreased and the economy is shrinking, budget documents show.</p>
<p>B.C. will bleed more than $5.5 billion in red ink before expecting its next surplus in 2013-14. The province's economy is forecast to shrink 2.9 per cent this year and then increase slowly in the following two years, although Hansen admitted it could dip downward again at any time.</p>
<p>The financial strain is set to hit the pocketbooks of taxpayers.</p>
<p>British Columbians can expect to pay more for health care -- around $6 more per family per month next year -- as the province raises Medical Services Plan rates.</p>
<p>The MSP increase of six per cent each year for the next three years will earn the province $400 million by 2011-12. Hansen said the money will help fund a ballooning health-care budget. The impact on low-income earners, such as seniors, will be offset by a new MSP assistance program, he said.</p>
<p>"MSP premiums currently account for about 10 per cent of health-care costs," said Hansen. "But rates have not increased since 2002 -- even as provincial health spending has risen by 45 per cent. So this increase is reasonable."</p>
<p>The MSP hike was quickly criticized by the B.C. Hospital Employees' Union and the NDP Opposition as a tax grab.</p>
<p>Health care, the province's largest expense, will grow six per cent each year and largely maintain the level promised in the pre-election February budget.</p>
<p>Education funding also holds steady, but the B.C. Teachers' Federation said school officials will be forced to make cuts in the face of rising costs and higher MSP premiums.</p>
<p>The government's promise of full-day kindergarten for five-year-olds will be available to only half the province by September 2010. The budget allocates $151 million to fund it for all children by 2011.</p>
<p>Social service spending, including income assistance for the unemployed, is set to rise $445 million over three years.</p>
<p>But Children's Representative Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond slammed the</p>
<p>government for failing to tackle child poverty. "We have had a historic downturn in the fortunes of B.C. that has affected children and families and working families," she said. "And where's the support? The need is not matched by the response."</p>
<p>A drop in personal, corporate and sales tax revenue, combined with a record low price for natural gas, will cost the province $2 billion in lost revenue this year, and $3.9 billion over the next three years. That's partly offset by $1.6 billion from Ottawa to help with the new harmonized sales tax, which B.C. will receive over three years.</p>
<p>Hansen called Ottawa's HST payment "hugely beneficial" but reiterated it was not the motivating factor in pursuing the unpopular new tax.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale rebates on the provincial portion of the HST will be given for some products, including energy for residential heating and power, gasoline for motor vehicles, books and children's clothing.</p>
<p>The HST combines the five per cent goods and services tax and the seven per cent provincial sales tax.</p>
<p>Small businesses will receive a tax break from the budget, and the basic personal income tax credit will be increased to $11,000 next year.</p>
<p>To save money, the budget proposes to cut almost all ministries, except for Health and Education. It also identifies $3.4 billion in cuts to advertising, professional services, travel and office expenses over the next three years -- exceeding the $1.9 billion in savings promised in February.</p>
<p>One cut sure to draw criticism is to discretionary grants -- payments to thousands of community groups and associations ranging from school parents' associations to arts festivals and minor hockey associations.</p>
<p>Dozens of those groups are already complaining about the loss of gaming grants, and the budget outlines a further $296 million in cuts found since February, although it doesn't specify which groups are hit.</p>
<p>In total, discretionary grants are set to drop 30 per cent, or $354 million, to a total of $815 million this year.</p>
<p>NDP Leader Carole James slammed the Liberals for not providing larger increases to health and education.</p>
<p>"This is a budget built on fiscal incompetence and deceit," she said. She called the Liberals "a tax-and-cut government."</p>
<p>Premier Gordon Campbell defended the decision to both run a deficit and make cuts.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of things I'd still love to be able to do, but frankly right now in British Columbia we can't afford that if we're going to be reasonable and have a prudent plan," he said.</p>
<p>The province will have to show restraint in coming years in order to return to a surplus, said Campbell.</p>
<p>"It's going to take a lot of work and a lot of discipline for us to get back to balance."</p>

<p>The White House on Tuesday added a new, furry -- and yes, cuddly -- weapon to its flu-fighting arsenal as the United States prepares to combat a resurgence of the H1N1 virus this fall: The Sesame Street muppet Elmo.</p>
<p>One week after a group of White House advisers predicted up to 90,000 Americans could die this flu season from the new strain of flu, the Obama administration unveiled a public health ad campaign featuring the cheery children's television character encouraging proper hygiene habits as a way to combat the virus.</p>
<p>The four ads tell children, who are among the most vulnerable to H1N1infection, to "keep happy and healthy on Sesame Street" by regularly washing their hands, avoiding rubbing their eyes, mouth and nose and sneezing into their arms.</p>
<p>"Younger children and their parents are some of the people most at risk from the new H1N1 flu virus and with schools starting back up again and the weather starting to get colder, we need to do everything we can to get these important messages about how to prevent the spread of the flu out there," said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the Elmo ad campaign came as senior administration officials briefed President Barack Obama on the status of the U.S. government's pandemic preparations.</p>
<p>The White House sparked a wave of renewed concern -- and some criticism -- about the potential impact of the swine flu when the president's council of advisors on science and technology issued an Aug. 24 report that included a "plausible scenario" in which half the U.S. population could be infected by the virus.</p>
<p>It said the second wave of the H1N1 virus could see up to 1.8 million Americans hospitalized and 30,000 to 90,000 die, with infections peaking in mid October just as a vaccine for the flu is expected to be ready.</p>

<p>Manitoba's battered pork industry is bracing for another blow as Manitoba's chief veterinary officer has confirmed the H1N1 flu virus has spread to several hog herds in the province.</p>
<p>Dr. Wayne Lees said the virus was first detected at the end of June and has spread to several herds, including sow barns, nursery barns and feeder barns.</p>
<p>Lees said the virus was spread to hogs by human contact with the animals. That's something that will likely continue as the virus spreads among people, many of whom don't realize they're sick.</p>
<p>"It hasn't shown any evidence to date that would cause me to be unduly concerned," Lees said. "We expect that just as in people, the infection will spread through a barn just as it would through a school. Pigs will run a bit of a runny nose for a while. They'll cough for a while. And then they'll recover. That's exactly the pattern that we've seen."</p>
<p>Hogs found to have the virus recovered in four to seven days. No deaths have been reported in these herds.</p>
<p>Lees stressed there was no risk to people since no sick animal went to slaughter. Normal cooking kills the virus in meat.</p>
<p>"If there is any risk, it would be between people who work in swine barns and the pigs," he said. "You've got a lot more risk sharing a phone or a computer keyboard or going into public places."</p>

<p>Cancelled surgeries and higher medical premiums. Full-day kindergarten, but no extra money for school boards or daycare.</p>
<p>A bigger personal tax exemption -- but more taxes.</p>
<p>More money for tourism, less for arts and culture.</p>
<p>B.C. residents were scrambling Tuesday to figure out how the provincial budget affects them.</p>
<p>Health</p>
<p>As B.C. health regions cancel surgeries, close operating rooms and cut grants for community health programs, the province is increasing monthly medical-plan fees to help pay for some of what's left.</p>
<p>Beginning in January, premium costs of the Medical Services Plan will rise by about six per cent, adding $3 to a single person's monthly cost and $6 to a family plan. After that, they'll go up relative to increases in health spending.</p>
<p>Those with low incomes -- about 180,000 of the province's population of 4.4 million -- will be spared the increase and will see their premiums reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Colin Hansen says health funding will increase by almost $18 million for the next three years and reach $15.7 billion by 2011-2012.</p>
<p>This year's health budget is set at $14.2 billion -- $812 million more than in 2008-2009.</p>
<p>The new budget includes $80 million to provide vaccines and other resources to prepare for this year's expected H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Health authorities and hospital societies predict spending hikes of $142 million in 2009, $91 million in 2010 and $135 million in 2011. To pay for the increases, authorities expect to increase their own sources of revenue.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>On the education front, every five-year-old in B.C. will get to go to school all day in the fall of 2011 -- if their parents let them.</p>
<p>Beginning in September 2010, about half of B.C.'s kindergarteners will get to start school full time if they choose to; the following year, all children will have the option of full-time kindergarten.</p>
<p>The new Liberal budget includes $151 million -- $44 million in 2010 and $107 million in 2011 -- to introduce the program across B.C.</p>
<p>But while the government has committed to all-day kindergarten, Vancouver school board chairwoman Patti Bacchus said school boards aren't seeing any budget increases to pay for converting classrooms, buying extra books, blocks and learning materials -- or to pay school administrative costs for opening up potentially hundreds of new kindergarten classes.</p>
<p>Elementary and secondary schools aren't getting any additional funds for the 2009-2010 year.</p>
<p>Total spending remains at $5.7 billion for kids from kindergarten to Grade 12.</p>
<p>Post-secondary schools will get a budget hike of $93 million this year.</p>
<p>School-district spending is up $102 million this year, and expected to increase slightly in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>Bacchus said her district already knows it will be short about $12 million for the 2010-2011 school year, just to pay for wage and benefit costs in collective agreements negotiated by the province.</p>
<p>Families</p>
<p>Families will see some benefit from a bigger personal tax exemption allowed them, but the new harmonized sales tax may cancel it out.</p>
<p>Michael Laycock, a self-employed technical editor whose family lives in Vancouver, doesn't expect businesses to pass along HST savings.</p>
<p>"It just seems to me Vancouver is a really expensive city to begin with, and it just seems like the HST is just really going to add up," he said.</p>
<p>The Laycocks feel lucky to have their two-year-old daughter in daycare -- "but it is expensive."</p>
<p>According to the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., in 2008, an average Lower Mainland family with a four-year-old in full-time child care and a seven-year-old in after-school care paid 20 per cent of their monthly expenses, or $12,000 for child care -- if they could find it.</p>
<p>Tourism and culture</p>
<p>There are also big changes for tourism, culture and arts -- a huge boost for tourism marketing but imminent cuts for arts groups.</p>
<p>Hansen announced $39 million in additional money for tourism, one-time funding designated for marketing in Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>That's in addition to $65 million already in the budget for tourism -- funds previously used by the recently dissolved Tourism B.C.</p>
<p>But not all members of the industry were ready to celebrate.</p>
<p>Peter Gibson, spokesman for the Canada West Ski Areas Association, said the marketing dollars would help cash in on the upcoming Olympics.</p>
<p>But, he said, there's still a long way to go in mitigating the effects of the HST on the industry.</p>
<p>Funding for arts and culture groups for this year is protected by leftover funds from last year and by gaming funds, said Scott Walker, co-ordinator of the Professional Arts Alliance of Greater Victoria.</p>
<p>But the budget projects funding for next year to drop drastically -- from $19.5 million for arts and culture in last year's operating budget to about $3.75 million the next year.</p>
<p>"These are very dramatic cuts,' said David Shefsiek, chair of the Professional Arts Alliance of Greater Victoria. "They'll likely be the end of some of the smaller arts groups."</p>

<p>Jamie Lynn found a lonely black sheep on her farm.</p>
<p>Marcia got an apple tree from Charmaine.</p>
<p>Tiffany bought a harvester.</p>
<p>Accompanied by plump, bug-eyed farm animals, agriculturally obsessed status updates have been inundating the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> walls of the young and old this August. Three of the site's top 15 fastest-growing applications are now farming related: FarmVille, Farm Town and (Lil) Farm Life.</p>
<p>The sites allow users to grow and harvest their own crops, customize their farms with scarecrows, streams and hedges, and send gifts, like wheat and hogs, to their friends.</p>
<p>FarmVille doubled its active users from 16 million at the beginning of August to more than 32 million by the end of the month. Farm Town boasted nearly 19 million users and 1,100,000 fans, from Pakistan to Hoboken, N.J.</p>
<p>For some, the appeal has to do with rural nostalgia. For others, it's just another time waster gone viral.</p>
<p>Petra Wilson has elaborate farms on all three sites.</p>
<p>“I'm a FarmVille junkie,” said the 45-year-old Ajax, Ont., woman.</p>
<p>Her avatar, a green-mohawked sprite in purple overalls, is visible among neat rows of ducks, cows and eggplant shrubs. She grew grapes this week and harvested them – by clicking on the bunches.</p>
<p>Ms. Wilson said she has grown attached to the game because it reminds her of life on a farm as a teenager.</p>
<p>“I'm an old farm girl,” she said. “We had chickens, cows, horses, pigs, dogs, cats, bugs – everything.”</p>
<p>Ms. Wilson, who has diabetes and a brain tumour in remission, said the applications are “a calmer.” “Instead of sitting in front of the TV and staring at nothing, at least I'm using my mind.”</p>
<p>Users advance through the games by harvesting and selling crops, helping their virtual neighbours and inviting friends to join. On FarmVille and Farm Town, they can also trick out their farms with items bought via PayPal. Scarecrows and outhouses are “hot items” said Ms. Wilson, who's now after a Canadian flag.</p>
<p>Besides crows, leaves and weeds, nothing calamitous happens in the virtual farm worlds: there are no seasons, droughts, mad cow or swine flu.</p>
<p>For many users, the wholesome application appeals because it feeds two time-honoured workplace traditions: procrastination and competition.</p>
<p>Jakki Chrysler, a 23-year-old graphic designer from Oakville, Ont., joined FarmVille last month after co-workers invited her to compete for best farm.</p>
<p>One month in, Ms. Chrysler isn't bored with the rudimentary game.</p>
<p>She compares the application to Tamagotchi and The Sims, where users “kind of play god.” She thinks the last application that captivated this way was YoVille, which let users customize lavish apartments for their avatars.</p>
<p>People's farms mirror their own domestic habits, Ms. Chrysler said.</p>
<p>“I have a friend who's very messy and her crops are destroyed and she hasn't moved up in any level. She neglected her farm. One of my friends is very neat and organized and all of her animals are organized in such a way,” said Ms. Chrysler, who just got a tractor to plow her pig manure.</p>
<p>Neither Ms. Chrysler nor any of her friends grew up on farms, which might explain why they pen their chickens in with their cows, something Ms. Wilson tut-tuted.</p>
<p>“When I do my farm, there's no way I would have these animals with these animals: Pigs eat the chickens.”</p>

</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>448 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada is not moving too slowly on the production and approval of the H1N1 flu vaccine, the country's chief public health officer said yesterday in response to renewed questions about whether the vaccine will be rolled out in time to protect Canadians from a second wave of the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>"There isn't actually any delay," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, who went on to explain Ottawa's decision to order a vaccine with an adjuvant, an additive that can help generate a stronger immune response to the vaccine, often making it possible to reduce the size of the vaccine dose or the number of doses needed.</p>
<p>"That means more vaccine for the rest of the world," said Butler-Jones at a news conference. "Rather than hogging all of that material, it provides it for the rest of the world."</p>
<p>Previous clinical trials on a bird flu virus showed that vaccines with an adjuvant were more effective, he added, and they can provide for "drift" if the virus changes slightly.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones was responding to an editorial that appeared Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that suggested Ottawa's decision to use a vaccine with an adjuvant is slowing down the regulatory approval process. It called for a non-adjuvanted vaccine to be approved first so that high-risk groups can be vaccinated sooner than mid-November, when Canada's order is expected to be ready.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones, however, said ordering a vaccine with or without an adjuvant makes no difference to Canada's timeline to start immunizing people in mid-November. "The goal in Canada is to ensure as much vaccine as possible, as early as possible. At the same time, it must be both safe and considered effective. Only in retrospect will the various plans be judged, but we are moving as safely as we reasonably can."</p>
<p>Ottawa has ordered 50 million doses of the vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> that are being produced at the company's Ste. Foy plant. The results of clinical trials - which have yet to begin in Canada but have started in other countries - are to determine how many doses of vaccine are needed and how potent to make them. Butler-Jones said the clinical trial process normally lasts months for a new vaccine but will be sped up in this case.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who held the conference to announce details of $400 million in spending for First Nations and Inuit health services, emphasized that there will be enough vaccine for every Canadian who wants the shot.</p>

<p>The White House added a new, furry - and yes, cuddly - weapon to its flu-fighting arsenal yesterday as the United States prepares to combat a resurgence of the H1N1 virus this fall: the Sesame Street muppet Elmo.</p>
<p>A week after a group of White House advisers predicted as many as 90,000 Americans could die this flu season from the new strain of flu, the Obama administration unveiled a public health ad campaign featuring the cheery children's television character encouraging proper hygiene habits as a way to combat the virus.</p>
<p>The four ads tell children - who are among the most vulnerable to H1N1 infection - to "keep happy and healthy on Sesame Street" by regularly washing their hands, avoiding rubbing their eyes, mouth and nose, and sneezing into their arms.</p>
<p>"Younger children and their parents are some of the people most at risk from the new H1N1 flu virus, and with schools starting back up again and the weather starting to get colder, we need to do everything we can to get these important messages about how to prevent the spread of the flu out there," said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the Elmo ad campaign came as senior administration officials briefed U.S. President Barack Obama on the status of his government's pandemic preparations.</p>
<p>The White House sparked a wave of renewed concern - and some criticism - about the potential impact of the swine flu when the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology issued an Aug. 24 report that included a "plausible scenario" in which half the U.S. population could be infected by the virus.</p>
