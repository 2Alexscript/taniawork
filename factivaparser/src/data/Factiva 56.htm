<p>The province's top medical officer says all Albertans will likely be immunized for the H1N1 virus this fall, but the World Health Organization's decision to officially designate the swine flu as a pandemic Thursday is no cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical health officer, said plans are underway to vaccinate the most vulnerable Albertans in October, but eventually everyone could receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>"It's in the plans, but we still have to work out some of the details," Corriveau said. "We can never know for sure what will happen, but it's the game plan to have something available to the jurisdictions to distribute and roll out in late October."</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said Thursday that the WHO's decision to declare a pandemic for the first time in 40 years will have little impact on Alberta.</p>
<p>"Our response will be unchanged," he said. "My understanding of the World Health Organization rating is it's not relative to the severity, but to the extent of the countries impacted."</p>
<p>The UN body was not recommending the closure of borders nor restrictions in the movement of people, goods and services.</p>
<p>Corriveau said the WHO bumped the pandemic alert to six--the highest level--but the virus does not appear to be any more virulent or spreading any faster in Alberta than when it was first identified.</p>
<p>Of the 216 people tested positively for H1N1 in Alberta, only five cases were serious enough to require hospitalization, he said.</p>
<p>"We're still not recommending that we close any schools," Corriveau said.</p>
<p>City school boards say they aren't taking any additional measures as a result of the move to level six.</p>
<p>"For our district, it will be business as usual," said Catholic school board spokeswoman Lori Nagy.</p>
<p>Once a student with the H1N1 virus is identified in the school, a note is sent home to all parents, and custodians thoroughly clean the school, with particular attention to doorknobs, taps and keyboards.</p>
<p>So far, the Edmonton Catholic school board 11 cases in 10 schools, she said.</p>
<p>The Edmonton public school board, which has 20 confirmed cases in 12 schools, is still following protocols for frequent hand-washing and is encouraging ill students to stay home, said spokeswoman Jane Farrell.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader David Swann warned the government to be cautious with its overhaul of the health-care system. He said the system "could be overwhelmed by a single catastrophic emergency, such as a sudden, serious disease outbreak.</p>
<p>"They must resolve the issues that are currently hampering our ability to respond to the flu: overcrowded emergency rooms, a shortage of doctors," he said.</p>
<p>Corriveau urged Albertans to continue to wash their hands frequently and stay home from work if they are sick with flu symptoms, but said there's no reason to be tested for the virus unless people are at greater risk because of other conditions.</p>
<p>He said people who smoke, are obese or are in poor health can suffer more serious infections. People with chronic conditions such diabetes, immune system diseases, heart and lung diseases, as well as pregnant women, are also believed to be at a higher risk, he said.</p>
<p>The province is monitoring the progress of the disease, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>"I think we have to have accurate information and tell Albertans that we are preparing for the worst, but at this point in time, the situation is highly manageable," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Manitoba seeks medical volunteers for flu pandemic; 'We're in a war zone,' native chief says in plea for help</b>
</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div>

</p>
<p>Manitoba's health minister has issued a public plea for doctors and nurses to volunteer in remote northern First Nations communities hit hard by the swine-flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Theresa Oswald met Thursday with leaders of Manitoba's health-care professionals to stress the need for more primary-care workers in the northern communities, where an alarming outbreak of H1N1 flu is responsible for most of the province's swine-flu cases.</p>
<p>"We have called for help, and we're going to be there to assist Manitobans who need the most help right now," Oswald said. "Our aboriginal people have health status that is quite disparate from non-aboriginal people; that is a fact. And in such a situation, as they would in any situation of illness, (First Nations) are more compromised and we are seeing that to be true."</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, the province's chief provincial public health officer, said a disproportionate number of Manitobans from First Nations appear to be infected with a severe form of the flu.</p>
<p>Out of 24 Manitobans who are in intensive care for severe flu-like symptoms, two-thirds are aboriginal, Kettner said.</p>
<p>Nine cases of swine flu have been confirmed in St. Theresa Point First Nation, about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, said Chief David McDougall--that includes five new cases on Thursday. The neighbouring community of Garden Hill First Nation has at least two confirmed cases of the virus.</p>
<p>The provincial government has sent antivirals, surgical masks and respirators to the First Nations and Inuit Health branch of Health Canada, and arranged for doctors to be flown to both St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill, said Terry Goertzen, Manitoba Health's assistant deputy minister.</p>
<p>Garden Hill Chief David Harper on Wednesday called on governments to set up a temporary hospital in the region, adding he's struggling to bring in even the most basic medical equipment.</p>
<p>"Whatever it takes," he said. "We're in a war zone, we have to protect... our children. Especially our children, and our elderly."</p>
<p>First Nations officials say the outbreak in northern Manitoba is being driven by a chronic shortage of medical care on reserves, coupled with poor public sanitation and overcrowded housing.</p>
<p>They say Ottawa and Manitoba have been unable to provide the afflicted reserves with basic medical care--such as a doctor, or even hand-sanitizers.</p>
<p>"It is important that Manitobans and the Canadian public understand the obstacles and hurdles First Nations are facing in accessing the basic health-care services that many others take for granted," Ron Evans, Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, told a gathering on Thursday to mark the first anniversary of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's apology to Indian residential-school survivors.</p>
<p>"We are on the verge of a full-scale pandemic," Evans said.</p>

<p>The province's top medical officer said Thursday all Albertans will likely all be immunized for the H1N1 virus this fall--a vaccination effort that could cost millions.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical health officer, said plans are underway to vaccinate the most vulnerable Albertans in October, but eventually everyone could receive a shot.</p>

<p>"Our response will be unchanged," he told reporters in Calgary. "My understanding of the World Health Organization rating is it's not relative to the severity, but to the extent of the countries impacted."</p>
<p>Corriveau said WHO bumped the pandemic alert to six -- the highest level -- but the virus does not appear to be any more virulent or spreading any faster in Alberta than when it was first identified.</p>
<p>Of the 216 people tested positively for H1N1 in Alberta, only five cases were serious enough to require hospitalization, he said.</p>
<p>Alberta Health officials had no estimate Thursday of how much it will cost the province to roll out a swine flu vaccination campaign, but the price tag would likely be in the millions.</p>
<p>In a normal year, the provincial government spends about$3.2 million to provide free influenza vaccines for at-risk populations.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said the province is prepared to do what is necessary to react to the virus. "No matter what the costs are, we have to be prepared for it," he said.</p>
<p>While Alberta and Ottawa are contemplating widely immunizing the population, a leading pandemic expert said Thursday governments will likely prioritize immunizing high-risk populations with any vaccine that is developed.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Loeb said if there are no constraints on the vaccine's availability, then anyone who wants to be immunized should receive a shot.</p>
<p>"The first priority has to be high risk individuals," said Loeb, division director of infectious diseases at Mc-Master University.</p>
<p>People who smoke, are obese or are in poor health can suffer more serious infections, said Corriveau.</p>

<p>A Timeline of The swine flu crisis</p>
<p>April 24, 2009</p>
<p>World Health Organization announces that about 800 suspected cases of so-called swine flu have been recorded in mexico, including 60 suspected deaths, as well as seven cases in the united states. Health authorities around the world go on alert. mexican officials later say the first recorded fatality was a 39-year-old woman who died on april 13 in oaxaca, southeastern mexico.</p>
<p>April 25</p>
<p>WHO warns that the virus, identified as a member of the H1n1 family, has "pandemic potential." mexico orders isolation of sick people and closes many public establishments.</p>
<p>April 27</p>
<p>First three cases are confirmed in Europe. WHo raises its alert level from three to four on a scale of six, signalling a "significant increase in risk of a pandemic."</p>
<p>April 28</p>
<p>First cases in Central America and The Middle East</p>
<p>April 29</p>
<p>A 23-month-old mexican child is the first confirmed death in the united states. WHo raises alert level to five, calling on countries to prepare for an "imminent" pandemic. the first cases involving people who had not visited mexico are confirmed in the u. s., spain and germany. mexican finance minister agustin Carstens says the impact of the flu crisis could cut gdP by between 0.3 and 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p>April 30</p>
<p>WHO adopts the term "influenza A</p>
<p>(H1N1)" after veterinary experts point out that disease is not occurring among pigs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>For clues about the swine flu pandemic, look to 1918</b>
</div><div>Stephen Hume   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>635 words</div><div>12 June 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Almost half the world's countries now report outbreaks of the H1N1 viral infection commonly called swine flu. Laboratory-confirmed cases approached 28,000 this week. Canada now ranks third after Mexico and the U.S. for infections.</p>
<p>And as the World Health Organization officially declared Thursday that the planet is finally in the throes of the influenza pandemic, comparisons to the Spanish Flu of 1918 are naturally being made.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, judging from news reports, the province moved Wednesday to begin mobilizing its own pandemic influenza plans as the number of patients developing severe symptoms continued to increase -- at time of writing, there were 56 confirmed cases and 27 patients required intensive care. Schools and daycares were closed in some communities and people presenting flu symptoms were being urged not to go to hospital emergency wards.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Free Press quoted Dr. Ethan Rubinstein, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba. He said the outbreak is expected to follow the same pattern as in 1918.</p>
<p>We can hope those parallels don't track too closely. So far there's no cause for undue anxiety. Most cases appear relatively mild. However, prudence suggests revisiting the experience of 91 years ago. Knowledge gleaned from what happened then might help inform our reactions today.</p>
<p>Much of the 1918 pandemic remains a mystery. The flu wasn't a reportable illness then and communications were poor; health infrastructure was limited and local; diagnostic techniques and lab technology were primitive. Yet the Spanish flu may still teach useful things.</p>
<p>One troubling parallel springs right to the foreground. The impact upon aboriginal people in 1918 was disproportionately high. In British Columbia, post-pandemic mortality estimates doubled when previously uncounted aboriginal deaths in remote communities were finally tabulated.</p>
<p>In Manitoba today, half the cases requiring intensive care are aboriginal, particularly worrying for public health authorities in B.C., which has one of Canada's largest aboriginal populations.</p>
<p>Another parallel that's worth thinking about is how the disease pulsed through the population. The 1918 outbreak occurred in three distinct phases. The Spanish flu first occurred in the early months of that year with a relatively mild wave of infections in the United States. It then appeared to abate during the summer months. That proved the lull before the storm. A second, much more virulent phase erupted in the fall.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu first arrived in B.C. at the small community of Corbin, just south of the Crowsnest Pass.</p>
<p>It reached Vancouver in October, subsided again and then returned for a third lethal phase in December and January 1919, before abruptly vanishing.</p>
<p>It's for just such a pattern of recurring waves of infection that today's public health and emergency measures planners will be watching closely as they prepare response strategies. Could this week's sudden heavy load of severe cases in Manitoba mark the beginning of a second, more dangerous phase? Let's hope not.</p>
<p>In 1918, Vancouver suffered among the highest urban mortality rates in North America. In late October, at the worst of the pandemic, 1,700 of the city's 109,000 inhabitants were in hospital. Historians think 795 of Vancouver's 4,890 reported cases died. The number is probably conservative.</p>
<p>Yet that outcome represented a public health triumph. Deaths would have been more numerous had the city not been blessed with a far-sighted genius in its medical health officer.</p>
<p>Dr. Fred Underhill had carefully observed and planned during the early phases of the pandemic. He quelled anxiety, encouraged public engagement and deployed effective responses when the worst arrived.</p>
<p>There's one more important lesson to learn from the Spanish flu.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG -- For the past month, flights in and out of Garden Hill First Nation have been leaving full and returning empty.</p>
<p>They depart with wheezing, coughing residents and come back with nothing the town can use to combat the severe form of flu sweeping through the remote, 3,400-person community 500 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>“We are in a war with no artillery,” Chief David Harper said by cellphone as he walked across the fly-in town's tiny airport. “I'm looking at several Medevac planes, but still no masks, no hand sanitizer, no new equipment to speak of. I've been asking for this stuff for over a week and nothing has improved.”</p>
<p>On the day the World Health Organization formally declared influenza A/H1N1 a pandemic, several aboriginal communities in Manitoba said their ongoing flu battles have exposed huge flaws in the country's pandemic preparedness plan and offer a bleak hint of what aboriginal reserves across Canada will face should the pandemic worsen in the winter.</p>
<p>“The federal government says it has a plan in place, but that plan doesn't appear to include this part of the country,” Mr. Harper said shortly after learning that a pregnant Garden Hill woman with flu symptoms miscarried yesterday. In the past week, 11 Garden Hill residents have been airlifted to urban hospitals, most with severe flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Across the province, 24 people with flu symptoms – two-thirds of them aboriginal – are breathing with ventilators.</p>
<p>Influenza A has long been known to hit first nations communities harder than the rest of the population. Fatality rates during past pandemics have hovered between 5 and 10 per cent, and entire aboriginal towns were wiped out during the 1918 outbreak.</p>
<p>But Canada's pandemic preparedness plan included specific protocols for aboriginal communities only two years ago. And they're already in need of revision, some health advocates say.</p>
<p>“It's a guideline, but there's no money attached to it,” said Dr. Kim Barker, public health physician with the Assembly of First Nations. “There are still a lot of things that need to be worked out.”</p>
<p>In Garden Hill, the delivery of basic pandemic supplies appears to be one of those overlooked items. Mr. Harper said the band has already forked over $2,900 for supplies the federal government was supposed to provide and that he is flying to Winnipeg today to buy more.</p>
<p>“We can't wait any longer here,” he said.</p>
<p>Terry Goertzen, an assistant deputy minister in Manitoba's Health Ministry, said yesterday that the provincial government has sent surgical masks, respirators and antiviral drugs to the federal government for delivery to aboriginal communities, and it's not clear why those supplies haven't reached their destination.</p>
<p>If it's bad now, it could be much worse later. Many flu experts expect the pandemic to intensify this winter, a frightening prospect in aboriginal communities coast to coast where overcrowded housing and lower health levels prevail.</p>
<p>“We're talking about a handful of communities right now,” Dr. Barker said. “If they can't shift a few masks onto an airplane right now, what will it be like when we're dealing with dozens and dozens of first nations communities this fall and winter?”</p>
<p>Health officials may have underestimated the outbreak because it initially appeared severe among impoverished Mexican populations but not Canadian travellers to the country, Dr. Barker said.</p>
<p>“They forget that there are many communities here that are not full of the healthy, wealthy Club Med crowd,” she said. “We may soon have a Mexico situation on first nations reserves.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WHO's pandemic ‘phases' send a confusing signal; Health body needs to find a way to explain that A/H1N1 is a rapidly spreading virus, but not a red alert</b>
</div><div>ANDRÉ PICARD   </div>
<div>644 words</div><div>12 June 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>apicard@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>The World Health Organization yesterday declared a Phase 6 pandemic alert.</p>
<p>What that means, practically, is that there is community-based spread of influenza A/H1N1, a novel virus, in more than one region of the world – in this case North America and Australasia. (Europe, South America and Asia are also on the verge of broad community spread.)</p>
<p>While the word “pandemic” carries all sorts of frightening connotations in common parlance, the WHO definition is technical.</p>
<p>That is why the announcement – the first pandemic in the world since the Hong Kong flu killed more than one million people in 1968 – was greeted largely with a shrug.</p>
<p>In fact, it was expected. A senior WHO official said six weeks ago that Phase 6 was “imminent.”</p>
<p>The international health group spent the time since then priming health officials, journalists and the public to ensure the announcement would be anticlimatic rather than panic-inducing.</p>
<p>As Keiji Fukuda, head of the global influenza program at the WHO, said in a briefing to journalists earlier this week: “The declaration of phase changes, the movement from one phase to another, is not simply getting up in front of press cameras and making an announcement. It is a way to prepare the world to deal with the situation.”</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, Canada has been operating at Phase 6 since early May, when it activated the Pandemic Influenza Plan. Yesterday's announcement tells countries where A/H1N1 is not yet widespread to do the same.</p>
<p>Phase 6 also has some real practical implications for the WHO and the low- and middle-income countries that depend on its resources. Under the rules that govern the WHO, it can now move from containment operations to broader response measures. For example, it can give pharmaceutical companies the green light to proceed with production of an A/H1N1 vaccine. (Preliminary work such as growing vaccine strain is already under way, but a vaccine will not be ready until September at the earliest.)</p>
<p>In other words, the pandemic phases matter to much of the world.</p>
<p>The problem with the WHO pandemic phases, however, is that they send a confusing mixed signal.</p>
<p>“Phase 6 – the highest alert level” sounds worrisome. The public is left with the impression that a deadly killer is stalking the planet.</p>
<p>But the levels strictly reflect geographic spread and not severity. (It should be said that these phases are a new approach, developed after SARS and avian influenza, but there was an underlying assumption that a pandemic would necessarily be deadly.)</p>
<p>While influenza A/H1N1 is potentially severe, the reality is that, so far, the disease is pretty mild. As of yesterday, 74 countries had reported 27,737 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 141 deaths.</p>
<p>This is not in any way, shape or form, the Spanish flu of 1918, a pandemic that killed about 50 million people, although one cannot entirely rule out the possibility that A/H1N1 will become more virulent and deadly.</p>
<p>The WHO needs to find a simple way to transmit that message, something akin to the colour system used by U.S. Homeland Security, which sets the national threat level at blue, green, yellow, orange or red.</p>
<p>At the recent World Health Assembly, that is precisely what some countries demanded – a warning system that reflects both geographic spread and severity, a system with more subtlety.</p>
<p>The world is in pandemic Phase 6, but the number six should be coloured yellow, meaning it is a moderate and manageable threat.</p>
<p>A/H1N1 is a rapidly spreading virus, but it is not – and hopefully will not become – a red alert.</p>

</p>
<p>The risk</p>
<p>For Canadians, the risk posed by pandemic influenza A/H1N1 is pretty minimal. The pandemic-alert phases refer strictly to the geographic spread of the flu. Australia is seeing the rapid spread of flu – and related panic – that we saw in Canada a month ago.</p>
<p>the duration</p>
<p>History tells us that pandemics strike like a tsunami – after the initial wave hits the real danger often comes with subsequent waves. Flu viruses typically travel from east to west around the world, and they begin in the southern hemisphere. A/H1N1 is different in that it was first spotted in North America. But some epidemiologists believe the spread of the disease is only now beginning in earnest.</p>
<p>THE NUMBERS</p>
<p>A pandemic means there is community spread of a novel pathogen in more than one region of the world. It has nothing to do with sheer numbers or severity of symptoms. Early in a pandemic, the numbers are important to judge how the virus is spreading, but the numbers are increasingly irrelevant. The reality is only the sickest people get tested and counted and, with A/H1N1, the evidence suggests that most cases are mild.</p>

<p>While the World Health Organization upgraded the risk of a global spread of swine flu to a pandemic level yesterday, even that would not be enough to keep most U.S. workers feeling sick from dutifully dragging themselves into work.</p>
<p>Seventy-one per cent of U.S. workers said fears that they would lose their job or fall behind in their work makes them show up at the office every morning even when they are ill, a new poll finds.</p>
<p>But while they may think they are protecting their careers, those who drag their fever-ridden bodies in to work when they're sick have higher long-term risks of losing work due to illness than colleagues who pamper themselves at home, another study from Sweden has found.</p>
<p>In the U.S. survey, 38 per cent of 12,000 employees who voted on online job site Monster.com said they keep coming in to the office even when they are ill because their work load is so high they would otherwise fall behind.</p>
<p>Another 33 per cent said they are afraid they'd lose their job if they took off sick time.</p>
<p>A further 10 per cent said they stay out of the office when they're sick but continue to work from home. That leaves 19 per cent who said they rest up to get better and don't worry about work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Swedish study at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm concluded that employer efforts to set limits on sick leave could backfire.</p>
<p>“Discouraging workers from staying home when they are sick could lead to increased ‘sickness presenteeism,' and thus inadvertently increase sick leave,” as rundown workers have less strength to ward off future infections, said head researcher Gunnar Bergstrom in the study reported in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.</p>
<p>The research looked at two groups of workers – 3,750 public-sector employees, most of whom were female, and 2,500 private-sector employees who were almost all males. In the first year of the study, 19 per cent of the public-sector workers and 13 per cent of private-sector workers had more than five days where they were sick but still present in the workplace.</p>
<p>For these workers, the risk of having more than 30 days of sickness the following year was 40 to 50 per cent higher than for employees who had taken time off when they were sick.</p>
<p>Dr. Bergstrom concluded that employers who encourage staff to take leave when they're sick will get a payback in having a healthier staff in the long term.</p>
<p>Global assignments</p>
<p>on the decline: survey</p>
<p>Fewer employees will be getting international assignments this year than in the recent past, and those employees who do get assignments abroad will likely be older and more experienced, a new survey finds.</p>
<p>Belt-tightening employers believe that going with veteran employees reduces the risk of failure in international postings, according to the poll of 180 multinational companies by Illinois-based Brookfield Global Relocation Services.</p>
<p>A quarter of companies plan to cut the number of employees they relocate, the survey found. That is a huge rise from last year, when a similar survey found that just 5 per cent of companies planned to reduce their number of overseas postings.</p>
<p>Another 42 per cent said they expect no change in international postings, and the remaining 33 per cent said they were planning increases, but there would be fewer new postings than last year.</p>
<p>The majority of those to get assignments will be employees in their 40s or 50s, with several years' experience, the survey found. Just 9 per cent of new expatriates are in their 20s, which is the lowest in the survey's 14-year history.</p>

<p>Manitoba teachers will have greater resources this fall to teach grades 9 and 11 students about residential schools, Education Minister Peter Bjornson told several hundred people marking the first anniversary Thursday of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's apology to residential school survivors.</p>
<p>Bjornson told a predominately aboriginal crowd at Memorial Park that the province is developing made-in-Manitoba educational resources, including a bibliography, an interactive website and a video featuring archival footage and interviews with residential school survivors from all regions of the province.</p>
<p>In partnership with aboriginal organizations, the province is also developing a residential schools survivors speakers bureau "so social studies and history teachers will be able to call upon a wealth of knowledge and experienced individuals to help them understand the residential schools experience and how we can move forward together towards reconciliation," Bjornson said.</p>
<p>The announcement was part of a daylong event featuring entertainment and speeches by a host of native leaders. Many in attendance were residential school survivors.</p>
<p>Culture and acting Aboriginal Affairs Minister Eric Robinson, who represents the vast northern riding of Rupertsland, told the crowd the federal apology "meant a lot to myself and yourselves as survivors of this terrible, terrible experiment that was done by our national government."</p>
<p>After a brief speech, he invited elders to join him across the street to the legislature, where he made a statement marking the anniversary.</p>
<p>"I'm a part of that bunch," he told the crowd beforehand, referring to the politicians. "But don't think for a moment that I have forgotten who I am as a Cree Indian. That is first and foremost in my mind. I will never forget the tremendous abuses that I experienced in residential schools as well. Let's cross the street with pride, with our chests sticking out being proud of who we are as Indian people..."</p>
<p>A large group, led by a "grandfather drum," crossed Broadway and made its way into the Legislative Building, where the sound of the large drum reverberated off the high ceilings.</p>
<p>In the visitors gallery, the group listened as Robinson, in a ministerial statement to the House, listed a number of NDP initiatives, including equity partnerships for First Nations in the development of hydroelectric dams, land use rights for First Nations east of Lake Winnipeg, and increased investment in the University College of the North in The Pas.</p>
<p>But Robinson said much work needs to be done to improve First Nation housing, increasing high school graduation rates for aboriginal students, addressing the current H1N1 influenza outbreak, and "stopping the outrageous national shame of our missing and murdered aboriginal women."</p>

</div><div>By Mia Rabson   </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Canada's chief public health officer downplayed the severity of the flu outbreak Thursday, despite Manitoba calling for more help on affected reserves.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said despite the reports of serious illnesses, with more than a dozen First Nations people on ventilators in Manitoba and potentially hundreds of people sick on reserves in the Island Lake region in Manitoba, the H1N1 flu outbreak in Canada continues to be like a normal seasonal flu.</p>
<p>He said there is much interest in research to learn who is at greatest risk for severe illness but said there is no reason to believe the risk is higher among aboriginal peoples than any other groups in Canada.</p>
<p>"We may find that in the future but at the moment evidence is it doesn't matter who you are; everyone is susceptible," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization formally notified health officials worldwide Thursday that it was raising the pandemic alert to its highest level -- the first such declaration since the 1968 Hong Kong flu.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said it is not only aboriginal people who have come down with severe cases, and cautioned anyone from thinking this disease is affecting any one group more than others.</p>
<p>He said in total 138 people have been hospitalized out of about 3,000 confirmed cases of H1N1 flu in Canada. That means most people are recovering without serious illness or need of medical treatment, said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>He said the number of severe cases among those with the flu in St. Theresa Point, Garden Hill or any other First Nation may prove to be the same percentage, though he acknowledged it's really not known yet.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said in any influenza outbreak some communities are always hit harder than others.</p>
<p>"We've never been able to understand why that is," he said. "To make conclusions based on a couple of communities... it's way too early."</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said public-health experts are looking at what is happening on the reserves.</p>
<p>"There are reports of more severe illnesses in some parts of the country," she said. "This is a concern and we are investigating. We must resist speculation, rely on the science and report only on confirmed cases."</p>
<p>Both Aglukkaq and Butler-Jones said the WHO declaration addresses the number of cases found, not the severity of the illness, and said it shouldn't alarm anyone.</p>
<p>Nor does it change Canada's game plan, they said.</p>
<p>But the calls for the government to do more with First Nations came from all corners Thursday.</p>
<p>Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett said what's happened on the reserves in Manitoba is "terrible and inexcusable."</p>
<p>She said clearly there was a breakdown in the country's pandemic flu response when hundreds of people were sick, and nobody was tested "until two pregnant women were on a respirator."</p>
<p>"This is appalling," she said.</p>
<p>Bennett said Health Canada should help Manitoba with some of the $80 million set aside for pandemic response, and said an immediate assessment of the pandemic plan is needed.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the cold spring has allowed the flu to linger longer than usual but said he expects it to return in the fall. A vaccine is still in development.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Transat has to follow price-cutting giants; Profit sinks</b>
</div><div>Scott Deveau   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>545 words</div><div>12 June 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>After struggling through a price war all winter with a glut of packaged tours on the market to sun destinations, Transat A. T. said yesterday its fares to Europe this summer are now under pressure as such scheduled airlines as Air Canada and Air France continue to slash prices to attract passengers.</p>
<p>"What we see is that the scheduled airlines are putting prices very low to attract people and we have to follow them," said Jean-Marc Eustache, Transat A. T. chief executive, on a conference call. "Right now the scheduled airlines are doing crazy things."</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that people are still travelling, he said. With a little more than 50% of its summer schedule already booked, Transat's reservations from Canada to Europe are tracking at similar levels to 2008, while reservations from Europe are "slightly behind" last year, management said.</p>
<p>"This past winter we had more customers than ever, and this summer, even with the H1N1, again we have more customers than last year," Mr. Eustache said. "Even in a recession, people still travel, but usually a lot of them don't take the same type of hotel, they downgrade a little bit."</p>
<p>Transat, which is the largest travel-tour operator in the country, intends to cater to this market next winter by increasing the number of three-star offerings in sunny locales, rather than focusing more on four-star resorts, as it did this year.</p>
<p>Still, the competitive landscape is expected to remain quite aggressive with no relief from the recent collapse of Conquest Vacations. Mr. Eustache noted that the capacity increases already announced at WestJet Vacations for next winter more than compensate for the void left by Conquest.</p>
<p>The corresponding drop in prices is also expected to remain an issue, after being largely responsible for cutting its profit in half during the second quarter.</p>
<p>Transat reported yesterday its fully diluted net income fell to $20.7-million, or 62¢ a share, in the second quarter, compared with $41.4-million ($1.24) last year.</p>
<p>To offset the pricing declines, the company has embarked on a new three-year strategy aimed at increasing efficiency, productivity and competitiveness, which will be overseen by its new chief operating officer, Nelson Gentiletti, who was appointed yesterday.</p>
<p>Transat also said two of its founders, Lina De Cesare and Philippe Sureau, who have both been with the company for 30 years, will be resigning their posts as heads of tour operations and distribution, respectively, in November, but will remain on the board.</p>
<p>While the next two quarters are likely to be quite challenging, Cameron Doerksen, Versant Partners analyst, raised the stock to a "buy" yesterday.</p>
<p>"Our optimism is based on the company's efforts to reduce its costs and the potential for a rebound in travel demand heading into [next year]," he said.</p>

</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines Inc</span>. will shave additional capacity later this year, after warning that more than $6 billion (U.S.) in benefits it expected from lower fuel prices, its merger with <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span> and previous capacity reductions will be overtaken by declining revenues.</p>
<p>The reduction in available seats could mean more job cuts at the world's largest airline operator.</p>
<p>Delta executives told employees in a memo yesterday ahead of a presentation at an investor conference in New York that Delta will reduce system capacity by 10 per cent this year compared with 2008. Delta's previous plan was to cut system capacity 6 to 8 per cent. Delta also will reduce international capacity 15 per cent, 50 per cent deeper than the old plan to cut 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Delta said capacity reductions will begin in September. Among the reductions, Delta will:</p>
<p>Suspend non-stop service from Atlanta to Seoul and Shanghai and instead route customers wanting such flights via Detroit or Tokyo, or on non-stop partner flights.</p>
<p>Suspend non-stop flights from Cincinnati to Frankfurt, Germany, and London-Gatwick.</p>
<p>Reduce weekly frequencies of flights connecting Atlanta and Detroit to Mexico City and postpone some previously planned seasonal service between non-hub cities and Mexican beach destinations due to the impact of the swine flu virus on customers' travel plans.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nursing shortage a serious problem, Canadians tell pollster; About 75 per cent of those asked would prefer more nurses to a tax cut</b>
</div><div>Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>585 words</div><div>11 June 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Eighty-five per cent of western Canadians -- and slightly more nationally -- see the nursing shortage as a serious or somewhat serious problem, says a new poll.</p>
<p>And given a choice of more nurses or a tax cut, 75 per cent of Canadians -- both in the West and nationally -- would prefer more nurses, the poll found. Twenty per cent would choose the tax cut while five per cent were undecided.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted for the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, was released on the eve of the group's national conference, which drew about 800 nurses to Vancouver this week.</p>
<p>Organization president Linda Silas said the poll proves Canadians are supportive of investments in nurses.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,001 Canadians was conducted by Nanos Research the last week of May. It is considered accurate to within 3.1 percentage points 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>Despite the shortage of nurses, some of the highest-qualified ones in B.C. are unemployed, apparently because of unresolved issues about how to pay them.</p>
<p>Known as nurse practitioners (NPs), they are registered nurses with two years' additional training at the master's degree level.</p>
<p>They can diagnose, order tests, treat patients and prescribe most medications, except for addictive ones, such as narcotics for pain.</p>
<p>About 150,000 B.C. residents are without a family doctor and NPs could "help to ensure that more efficient and timely care is delivered to those citizens who need it," said Kathleen Fyvie, president of the B.C. Nurse Practitioner Association.</p>
<p>She said the provincial government provided new funding to health authorities from 2005 to 2007 when the first classes of NPs graduated from universities. The government says it has given health authorities millions of dollars, but Fyvie said that money is earmarked in health authority operating budgets for NPs already working, not for any additional hires.</p>
<p>As of a few months ago, there were 138 licensed NPs and 118 of them were employed, said Fyvie, who works for Fraser Health, alongside doctors providing primary care to hospitalized or discharged trauma patients with multiple injuries.</p>
<p>Unlike doctors, NPs can't bill fee for service so they are paid salaries that range from $85,000 to $95,000 plus benefits.</p>
<p>"There is a clear need for health care providers with our skill set," said Fyvie. "We are here and we are ready to work but appropriate funding models are the current hurdle," she said, noting that 45 more NPs graduate each year.</p>
<p>"We don't yet have an alternate funding formula. But we've been having discussions with the Ministry of Health and trying to work out those logistics," she said, adding that in the meantime, NPs who can't find work are leaving the province or taking jobs as registered nurses.</p>
<p>Bernadette Murphy, a government spokeswoman, said health authorities have funds to pay NPs and noted the majority of those working are employed through health authorities while others are employed by physicians in family practices, and some are in faculty positions.</p>
<p>Besides the nursing shortage, the conference will address issues such as the H1N1 flu pandemic alerts, the Canadian economy and its impact on health care. The Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions has more than 158,000 members.</p>

</p>
<p>I took a group of teenage girls to an Ottawa shopping centre last week where I noticed a public dispenser of hand sanitizer. Before heading to the stores, I made them douse their hands, my concession to the H1N1 flu virus that has begun spreading through Ottawa schools in recent days.</p>
<p>That was probably the last thought I gave to the flu, truth be told, at least until I began reading reports out of northern Manitoba of a very different experience with H1N1.</p>
<p>In St. Theresa Point, a fly-in community about 500 kilometres north of Winnipeg, the flu is not something that can be wiped away with a squirt of hand sanitizer. It has taken hold with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 people from the community of 3,200 have been airlifted to Winnipeg where many of them have required respirators to breathe. One pregnant woman is in critical condition and has lost her baby. Schools, community centres and gatherings have been shut down in an attempt to prevent further spread. But, given living conditions there, that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>For years, critics have decried the conditions in which many of Canada's First Nations live, particularly in the remote North. With H1N1, Canada's north-south divide has never been so starkly obvious.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the flu will be little more than an inconvenience for most. Some may become seriously ill and a few, particularly those with underlying health problems, might even die. But it is highly unlikely the community will become overwhelmed. We are being told, rightly, to be vigilant, but not to panic. There is no reason, says the city's medical officer of health Dr. Isra Levy, to keep healthy children home from school, even where there are flu cases.</p>
<p>"We can assure people that, in a general sense, for the vast majority of them, this is a business-as-usual type of experience," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Levy is right. As a community, we are sheltered from the worst the world can throw at us by a protective bubble that most of us don't even realize is there. It is not luck that allows us to brush off the kinds of illnesses that regularly devastate poorer parts of the world. We are protected by a functioning health care system, plentiful fresh food, clean, running water, available housing -- things that we take for granted and demand as Canadians.</p>
<p>So why do we find it so easy to shrug our shoulders when it becomes clear that this protective bubble doesn't extend to many of Canada's First Nations communities where running water and adequate housing are luxuries?</p>
<p>The story that has put remote St. Theresa Point on the map this week is not really about flu. It is about poverty, substandard living conditions and a country that prefers not to look too closely at this widening poverty gap. It is a story that should make southern Canadians -- we who can Purell our way through this pre-pandemic -- feel ashamed. The flu has acted as an uncomfortable highlighter.</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point First Nation Chief David McDougall held a press conference this week to talk about this situation in his community. He said lack of housing -- "It's common for 12 people to try and fit in a two-bedroom bungalow" -- and a lack of proper medical facilities make the region a powder keg when an infectious disease hits. H1N1 has lit the match.</p>
<p>"It's a wake-up call for everyone," he said. "We've stressed this over the years, saying this is an emergency or a catastrophe waiting to happen and now we're seeing it."</p>
<p>It is difficult to stop disease from spreading once it gets into communities such as St. Theresa Point because everyone must fly in and out of the community on the same plane and there is a housing shortage. In many remote communities there is not enough clean water, which rules out frequent hand washing as a first line of defence. And then there are chronic underlying diseases such as diabetes and tuberculosis which affect Canada's native population at a much higher rate than the rest of the country.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the World Health Organization warned that H1N1 could be a disaster for poor parts of the world. WHO director general Margaret Chan was talking about parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America when she asked: "What will happen if sudden surges in the number of people requiring care for influenza push already fragile health services over the brink?" She could also have been talking about many aboriginal communities in Canada's North.</p>
<p>The flu outbreak in St. Theresa Point -- which is among the most functional and best served First Nations communities in its area -- has drawn attention to the gaping need. Doctors and medicine are being flown in and patients flown out.</p>
<p>But simply treating the flu will do little to prevent another health crisis. Communities like St. Theresa Point need better health services, better housing, better schools and clean water.</p>
<p>Our country's health gap is something that can't be washed away.</p>

<p>BLAUVELT, N.Y.</p>
<p>The school superintendent who tackled and disarmed a man at a New York middle school says he's embarrassed by all the attention he's received. A school official says the armed man, a parent, was apparently upset over a letter South Orangetown Central School District Superintendent Ken Mitchell had written about swine flu policy. She says Peter Cocker of Tappan has a child who is ill but has not been tested for swine flu. The confrontation Tuesday ended when Mitchell overcame the man and took his gun.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>There are mounting and troubling signs that H1N1 flu and pregnancy don't mix well.</p>
<p>Six pregnant women in Manitoba are reportedly on ventilators because they are severely ill with the virus. And at least two pregnant women in the United States have died of flu complications after delivering babies by C-section.</p>
<p>A pregnant teenager in the Dominican Republic died, as did a pregnant woman in Scotland. A woman in St. Theresa Point, a First Nations community in Manitoba, miscarried after contracting H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Humankind's relationship with the new H1N1 virus is still in its infancy. But people who've studied the issue of pregnancy during flu pandemics don't like the signs they are seeing.</p>
<p>Dr. Denise Jamieson, an obstetrician-gynecologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's division of reproductive health, says she finds the evidence to date "very unsettling.''</p>
<p>Jamieson said in an interview from Atlanta, "There does seem to be increased severity in pregnancy. We don't have hard and fast numbers but there are enough reports that are concerning.''</p>
<p>A recent report in the World Health Organization's journal, Weekly Epidemiologic Record, noted of 30 H1N1 flu patients hospitalized in California, five were pregnant women. Of those, two developed severe complications -- spontaneous abortion and premature rupture of membranes.</p>
<p>Jamieson said the numbers are still small but seem to be pointing to a pattern seen in previous pandemics, when pregnant women were disproportionately harder hit than nonpregnant peers.</p>
<p>Jamieson said given the risk this flu poses to pregnant women, any who feel they may have contracted it should seek care quickly and should tell their doctor about potential exposures to people who had the virus. And they should take the antiviral drugs, she said.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>Schools are closed, public events have been cancelled and people are scrambling for masks to fight the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Leaders in some remote aboriginal communities in northeastern Manitoba, where high infection rates have caught the attention of the World Health Organization, say they are now in full pandemic mode.</p>
<p>"We've had to shut the school down. We've had to sanitize the whole school, the school buses, sanitize the medical transportation vehicles and also the police stations . . . twice a day,'' Chief David Harper of the Garden Hill First Nation said yesterday. "We're fighting an invisible enemy.''</p>
<p>Many residents are either sick or are fearful of becoming sick because they live in overcrowded homes with someone who is ill, Harper said. Travel into the community is being limited.</p>
<p>Harper was in Winnipeg yesterday to meet with other chiefs and to pick up medical supplies such as facial masks, which he says have run out in his community.</p>
<p>There is no hospital in the region and nursing stations are overwhelmed, he said. The federal and provincial governments have flown more doctors and nurses into the area in recent days, but it is not yet clear whether the spread can be contained.</p>
<p>Manitoba health officials confirmed a second case of H1N1 flu in Garden Hill on top of a handful of confirmed cases in nearby St. Theresa Point. More than a dozen other people have been hospitalized with flu-like symptoms -- all in a remote area 500 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg that has fewer than 10,000 residents.</p>
<p>One of the youngest victims is 18-month-old Peter Flett, who is recovering after being released from hospital in Winnipeg. The young boy was feverish for several days last week, but his mother says she was unable to convince staff at the Garden Hill nursing station to take his case seriously.</p>
<p>"He had a pale face and non-stop coughing, high fever,'' Christina Flett said, her young boy still wearing a mask as he bounced on her knee. "They told me not to bring him back, then I kept on phoning . . . they told me to just soak him and give him a bath and that's all.''</p>
<p>The boy was eventually airlifted to Winnipeg after waiting several hours for a flight.</p>
<p>Experts believe influenza can hit aboriginal communities hard because of underlying conditions such as poverty, overcrowded homes and high rates of other diseases such as diabetes. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 proved especially tough on reserves and wiped out large segments of the population.</p>

<p>Aboriginal leaders from northeastern Manitoba say some communities are in full pandemic mode as H1N1 influenza continues to hit the region.</p>

<p>Harper and other chiefs are calling on the federal government to boost health services in the area and improve housing.</p>
<p>Christina Flett, whose infant son tested positive for the flu, says she tried to get help for days, but was told to give her son a bath and some Tylenol.</p>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG -- As the World Health Organization vacillated over whether to call the H1N1 flu outbreak a full-blown pandemic yesterday, Manitoba shifted to a disaster footing, warning people away from hospitals, closing some northern schools and placing more flu victims in intensive care.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority posted flyers in hospitals asking the public to limit visits and urging people with flu symptoms to stay away altogether.</p>
<p>Nurses and physicians within those hospitals are straining to contain a surge in severe cases of the flu that appears to be unique in the country. Yesterday, two more flu sufferers were placed in intensive care, bringing to 27 the number of people on respirators due to flu symptoms.</p>
<p>The WHO is considering bumping up its pandemic alert from 5 to 6, which would indicate a global pandemic is under way. Under Stage 6, the highest alert level, drug-makers would have to fast-track production of a swine flu vaccine, currently scheduled to roll out in December.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, a disproportionate number of those on respirators are aboriginal. Several remote first nations communities have closed schools, placed limits on unnecessary travel and begun intense sanitization programs.</p>
<p>“We're trying as best we can to stop this thing,” said David Harper, chief of the Garden Hill First Nation, where a second person was confirmed with flu yesterday and dozens more are showing symptoms. “We're sanitizing our public vehicles and many of our public places twice a day.”</p>
<p>Chief Harper said the real problem lies in his community's housing. With upwards of 10 people living in the same house, residences offer ideal vectors for disease. When large-scale outbreaks inevitably arise, small rural nursing stations cannot keep up.</p>
<p>The first flu victim in Garden Hill, 18-month-old Peter Flett, had been prescribed Tylenol and cold baths for several days before nursing staff finally decided to medevac him 500 kilometres to Winnipeg.</p>
<p>“They lost a lot of time there,” said his mother, Christina Flett, her recovering son at her side playing with a toy truck. “We are lucky it didn't come out worse.”</p>
<p>In the House of Commons, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq rejected opposition charges that the government has failed to protect first nations. “Since April of this year we have been acting on our pandemic plan, which includes first nations communities,” she said.</p>

<p>Sackville, N.B. -- • Christie Blatchford's pooh-poohing of the uproar over the Raitt affair is an interesting take on personal ambition over selfless service (There's Nothing Sexy In This Feeding Frenzy – June 10). But from the swine flu outbreak to the isotope shortage, both the government and Canadians would have been better served with more Aglukkaq and less Raitt.</p>

<p>A Canadian soldier killed in Afghanistan and a woman from Quebec sick with H1N1 were among the deaths reported as top stories June 8 on the websites of major Canadian daily newspapers. A death that did not receive equal coverage was that of Michelle Simon.</p>
<p>Simon, 45, was killed by her estranged husband in downtown Barrie on Sunday. Her death is shocking but, sadly, it's not surprising. Between the years 2000 and 2006, 101 Canadian soldiers and police officers were killed. During that same period, more than 500 women - nearly five times as many - were murdered by their intimate partners.</p>
<p>This war on women in our country claims more lives than any other. It is a pandemic that costs Canada approximately $1.1 billion in health care costs alone each year. Michelle Simon's life and death were not covered in the way she deserved.</p>
<p>I challenge the Star to dedicate as much space next month to efforts to end woman abuse as you spent on other wars last month.</p>
<p>My thoughts are with Simon's family, as they try to make sense of their terrible loss. It is also with the people in our communities who are still fighting, for women's rights and women's lives.</p>

</div><div>Don Martin   </div>

</p>
<p>There's not a word of a lie on the instantly infamous Lisa Raitt recording.</p>
<p>The inadvertently recorded private chat between Natural Resources Minister Raitt and her hapless press aide offers a rare, albeit twisted, glimpse into the all-about-me reality of life in federal politics.</p>
<p>The conversation is raw, scheming and self- interested with a politically incorrect whisper of backstabbing -- just like many private conver- sations between normal adults when they assume nobody possibly could be listening.</p>
<p>Raitt is absolutely correct that scouring the globe for vital radioactive isotopes and scrambling to find medical alternatives is a "sexy" political file by contrast to, say, being the invisible minister of national revenue or intergovernmental affairs.</p>
<p>She has cause to complain that Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq had been mostly silent on the isotope shortage discussion until this week, leaving Raitt to provide tough answers and shoulder accountability for what is, after all, a medical crisis. (It's also worth noting that when I noted that Aglukkaq had done well handling the swine flu outbreak in April, only Raitt e-mailed me to wholeheartedly agree.) And Raitt was astute in noting that if she handled this incendiary file confidently and competently on her own, she would rocket up the ministerial ladder in the next shuffle and perhaps position herself for a shot at the top job in five years or so, once she learns French.</p>
<p>Her problem is that unvarnished truth and political correctness are often incompatible concepts in modern politics.</p>
<p>That's why the opposition parties have such high-calibre ammunition with potential for a voter backlash by pointing out there's nothing "sexy" about an isotope shortage to the 202 Canadians who will die from cancer today.</p>
<p>All that cancer victims know for sure is that short-sighted politics (including earlier Liberal governments) and nuclear power plant incompetence have conspired to leave thousands of fellow sufferers waiting for treatment, with tens of thousands more likely to endure long delays or less-effective alternatives in the months to come.</p>
<p>That's why a public apology from Raitt should've been forthcoming even earlier than it did (it came on Wednesday) to echo the private grovel she apparently delivered to Aglukkaq for her trash talk.</p>
<p>After all, Transport Minister John Baird sought forgiveness in the House of Commons for unleashing a profane four-letter blast at Toronto politicians whining about the slow flow of his stimulus funding.</p>
<p>For Raitt to leave such a cavalier comment flopping around without appropriate damage control only gave this controversy fresh oxygen to flare anew until, sooner or later, she admitted she was sorry.</p>
<p>With the apology duly issued, well, perhaps Raitt deserves another chance.</p>
<p>Anybody out there who has ever had their cellphone automatically dial someone on their address book, providing a gleeful eavesdropping opportunity to the person on the other end, can empathize with Raitt's plight.</p>
<p>But no sympathy should be forthcoming for communications sidekick Jasmine MacDonnell, who has been cursed with an impossible amount of bad karma after her role in leaving sensitive documents at a television studio last week.</p>
<p>She has inflicted enough damage to fire herself twice over while tainting her minister and knocking the prime minister back on his heels on the eve of a summer recess that Mr. Harper was hoping to launch on a political high.</p>
<p>Her performance was reckless enough for Conservative talking heads to wonder out loud if MacDonnell was actually a Liberal saboteur, unleashed like some sleeper agent to inflict maximum mayhem at the worst possible moment.</p>
<p>Consider the unfortunate sequence of events in which she had to engage to make this story happen. She had to accidentally record the conversation at a particularly queasy moment, lose the tape recorder in a washroom, have it found by a reporter, repeatedly refuse to pick it up for five months and then fight for a publication ban against the gift-wrapped story her tape recorder had delivered.</p>
<p>But a real-life perspective is required here.</p>
<p>The 1,400 people who will die from cancer this week matches the 1,400 Canadians who lost their job every day in May. Those are the pressing issues demanding rapt political attention.</p>
<p>Now that Raitt and her forgetful communications director have ensured no ministerial aide will ever again leave a document behind or forget to retrieve their tape recorder from a journalist, perhaps ministers will focus on Canadian realities instead of looking for sexy ways to enhance their careers.</p>

<p>WOMEN LEAD RISE IN U.K. COCAINE USE</p>
<p>LONDON - Cocaine use in England rose substantially in the five years to 2008 because of its cheapness, availability and increased social acceptance, a nationwide study said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>London was described as the epicentre of cocaine use in England, with an estimated 47,000 users. Other regions are catching up and all sections of society are part of the trend, the report said.</p>
<p>It also found that women's cocaine use had shot up and almost matched men's consumption.</p>
<p>"We're very much in an age of chemical enhancement and a pill for every ill," said Jim McVeigh, head of substance use at the Centre for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores University.</p>
<p>"We're seeing it both within the most deprived areas ... (and) the affluent ones which have traditionally been associated with cocaine being a champagne-type drug," he said.</p>
<p>A major reason for the increased usage is the price of cocaine, which has fallen to an average US$65.56 per gram from around $164 in the 1980s, making it a cheaper option than drinking for friends who can share one gram, splitting it into several lines to be snorted, McVeigh said.</p>
<p>Another reason is what McVeigh calls Britain's "medicalized society" where all kind of pills can be bought on the Internet for anything from increasing sexual performance to dieting.</p>
<p>RUSSIA PRESSED FOR CLOSER U.S. TIES</p>
<p>MOSCOW - German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier Wednesday urged the Kremlin not to miss an opportunity for improved ties with Washington and a new deal on nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>"With the entry into office of President Obama, there is a genuine chance for new co-operation between the United States, the European Union and Russia," Steinmeier, who is visiting Russia, said.</p>
<p>"The ghost of the Cold War has been banished... So I would like to say that the extended hand of the U.S. president should be boldly accepted," he said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama is due in Moscow early next month for talks with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev on a successor to a key, Cold War-era disarmament pact, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, set to expire in December.</p>
<p>EMERGENCY LANDING FOR SPANISH PLANE</p>
<p>MADRID - A Spanish airliner en route to Oslo with 189 passengers made an emergency landing in the Canary Islands Wednesday after the pilot detected a fault in one of the engines, sources at Spain's aviation authority AENA said.</p>
<p>They said there were no injuries in the incident, which occurred after the Airbus A320 of the Iberworld charter airline turned back to the island of Gran Canaria 10 minutes after takeoff for the Norwegian capital.</p>
<p>Several passengers, speaking to Norwegian news media, said they saw flames and heard explosions.</p>
<p>TYPHOONS TRIGGER TAIWAN QUAKES</p>
<p>PARIS - Surprised scientists say that typhoons which hit Taiwan unleash long, slow earthquakes, a phenomenon that may save the island from devastating temblors.</p>
<p>Seismologists installed movement sensors in boreholes at depths of 200-270 metres in eastern Taiwan, monitoring a spot where two mighty plates, the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian plate, bump and jostle in an oblique, dipping fault.</p>
<p>Over five years, researchers saw a remarkable link between tropical storms and "slow" earthquakes, a seismic beast first identified three decades ago.</p>
<p>Slow quakes entail a slippage in the fault that unfolds progressively over hours or days, rather than a sudden, violent release of the kind that destroys buildings and lives.</p>
<p>The sensors noted 20 such slow earthquakes, 11 of which coincided with typhoons, during the study period.</p>
<p>LIBYANS, ITALIANS SALUTE RENEWED TIES</p>
<p>ROME - Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, marking his first visit to Italy by pitching a tent in a historic park in Rome, praised Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for apologizing for Italy's colonial past in Africa.</p>
<p>Gadhafi, travelling with an entourage of hundreds for his three-day visit, was met by Berlusconi at the airport. Later, the two held a news conference followed by a private dinner. Berlusconi praised Gadhafi's "great wisdom" and insights in the Middle East conflict, while Gadhafi said Italy's leader showed "great courage" in seeking to make amends.</p>
<p>The visit comes after Italy agreed last year to pay its former African colony $5 billion over 25 years to compensate for the occupation from 1911 to 1943. That paved the way for closer commercial ties between the two countries and increased efforts by Libya to contain illegal immigration.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>U.S. BEHIND DEADLY BLAST: SENATOR</p>
<p>ASADABAD, Afghanistan - An Afghan senator heading an investigation into a grenade blast that killed three Afghan civilians charged Wednesday that U.S. troops had thrown the weapon.</p>
<p>The U.S. military denied the allegation and released a video it said showed troops were not responsible for the blast in the northeastern town of Asadabad on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The explosion was in a crowd that had gathered around a military convoy that had become stuck on a road. The death toll rose to three overnight and about 58 Afghans were wounded, hospital doctor Ihsanullah Fazli told AFP.</p>
<p>As well as releasing the video, the U.S. military issued a statement saying the blast was caused by a Russian-made grenade, which its troops would not use, and showed pictures of fragments of the weapon.</p>
<p>Senator Saleh Mohammad, the head of the investigation team appointed by Kabul, said he had seen the video but "couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>"I went to the hospital, I spoke to the wounded, I went to the site and spoke to the witnesses and now can say that the bomb was not thrown by the opposition but it was thrown by American forces," he said.</p>
<p>IRAQ MARKET BOMBING KILLS 19</p>
<p>NASIRIYAH, Iraq - A car bomb exploded in a market in a southern Iraqi town on Wednesday, killing 19 people including women and children in the bloodiest attack to hit the country in weeks.</p>
<p>Fifty-six people were also wounded in the bombing in the town of Batha in the predominantly Shiite province of Dhi Qar, according to the main hospital in the provincial capital Nasiriyah.</p>
<p>Although bombings remain common in the capital Baghdad and the restive northern city of Mosul, Wednesday's attack was the deadliest in the Nasiriyah area since November 2003.</p>
<p>The blast in Batha, 40 kilometres west of Nasiriyah, came three weeks ahead of the planned June 30 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraqi cities and major towns.</p>
<p>Several cars and market stalls were destroyed by the bomb, and much of the scene was covered in blood.</p>
<p>"We have to be careful of these poisonous snakes that are still hungry for Iraqi blood," said Hussein Ali Gathban, a 35-year-old government employee.</p>
<p>2 HURT IN BAGHDAD MORTAR ATTACK</p>
<p>BAGHDAD - An Iraqi woman and her daughter were wounded on Wednesday by a mortar round fired at a central Baghdad district that had been largely peaceful for a year, a defence ministry official told AFP.</p>
<p>"A mortar round fell on a flat in the Abu Nawas neighbourhood," the ministry official said. "A woman and her daughter were wounded."</p>
<p>It was the first time in more than a year that mortar or rocket fire had caused casualties in Abu Nawas.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood, long popular among Baghdad residents for its seafood restaurants along the Tigris river, has been revived in recent months after years of violence.</p>
<p>Lying opposite the heavily-fortified Green Zone which is home to Iraqi government offices and a number of foreign embassies, Abu Nawas had been the target of repeated attack like the Green Zone itself.</p>
<p>SWINE FLU HITS IN PALESTINIAN LAND</p>
<p>BETHLEHEM, West Bank - A Palestinian child was diagnosed with swine flu on Wednesday, the first confirmed case of the disease in the occupied territories, an official said.</p>
<p>A four-year-old boy who returned from the United States five days ago was diagnosed with the virus and placed in hospital quarantine in the town of Beit Jala in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, officials told AFP.</p>
<p>There was no threat to his life, they added.</p>
<p>It was the first case of infection with the A(H1N1) virus in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. Several dozen people in Israel have been diagnosed with swine flu.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>GAMBIA CHARGES 16 WITH TERRORISM</p>
<p>BANJUL - Authorities in Gambia have charged 16 people under anti-terrorism laws for trying to destabilize the former British colony, a nation regularly accused of using arbitrary detention to gag political opponents.</p>
<p>The 16 Gambians were charged at Brikama Magistrates' Court, 32 kilometres west of the capital Banjul, with "jointly conducting or engaging themselves in an unlawful act which could have seriously destabilized" the country in August 2006.</p>
<p>The charges, to which the men have pleaded not guilty, gave no further details.</p>
<p>President Yahya Jammeh has ruled mainland Africa's smallest country since seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1994.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations and press freedom watchdogs accuse his security forces of using arbitrary detention and other abuses of power to restrict freedom of expression and stifle political opposition.</p>

<p>TEN KILLED IN CONGO TRAIN CRASH</p>
<p>LUBUMBASHI - At least 10 people died and 28 were injured Wednesday when a train derailed in the Democratic Republic of Congo's southeast and rammed into a stationary train, national railways said.</p>
<p>The accident occurred early Wednesday between the towns of Tenke and Tshilongo, about 100 kilometres from Lumumbashi, the main city of Katanga province.</p>
<p>Aging tracks, which have not been replaced in 40 years, were blamed for the accident, the state rail company said.</p>
<p>U.S. HANDS OVER PIRATES TO KENYA</p>
<p>MOMBASA - The U.S. navy handed over 17 suspected Somali pirates to Kenya on Wednesday, taking the number of such captives in prisons along the east African country's coast to 111.</p>
<p>Kenyan police say the influx of suspected Somali pirates is clogging jails and congesting local courts and they would like foreign navies patrolling the shipping lanes off Somalia to start taking captives to other countries.</p>
<p>"We are looking at ways in the near future to have the pirates either charged in Seychelles, Egypt or Djibouti due to congestion," Sebson Wandera, the provincial CID operations chief, told reporters in the port city of Mombasa.</p>
<p>He said the latest arrivals would be taken to a court in Malindi, farther up the coast from Mombasa toward Somalia, and if suspected pirates continued to flood into Kenya they may have to be taken to the capital Nairobi.</p>
<p>International navies trying to curb piracy off lawless Somalia are often reluctant to bring suspects to their own countries because they either lack the jurisdiction, or fear the pirates may seek asylum.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Can your firm handle a disaster?; Most companies lack contingency plans</b>
</div><div>Derek Sankey   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; For Canwest News Service</div>
<div>705 words</div><div>10 June 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>F7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>It's human nature. It is only when some type of disaster or emergency occurs that people look at how pre-pared they are to endure it and respond to it. Many times, that's too late.</p>
<p>The same appears to hold true for corporations, which have had all kinds of challenges thrown at them this year, the latest of which was the need for pandemic planning as a result of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"When there is a disaster, then people start realizing," says Bob Klay, president of Klay Information Management Consulting Ltd.</p>
<p>But when companies are cutting costs or downsizing, preparing for any disaster--whether it's a pandemic, a natural disaster or any other disruption to business--tends to fall way down the list of priorities.</p>
<p>Craig Wilson, a strategic communi-cations consultant for Avaya Canada, says too often corporations focus on only the technology aspect of contingency planning.</p>
<p>"A lot of companies are focused (on) business continuity from an IT perspective,"he says, adding natural disasters and other emergencies are overlooked.</p>
<p>"Its financial impact can be much more huge, but unfortunately people are much more familiar with server failures and so see those as much more pressing,"he says.</p>
<p>With the recent concern about a potential pandemic, Klay says many employers just sent e-mails with links to websites of groups such as the World Health Organization. It's a start, but lacks much of a plan.</p>
<p>"The problem is that if you're an employee...it doesn't address the effect," says Klay.</p>
<p>"Most continuity plans lack depth," he says.</p>
<p>"They do scenario-based planning based on having no access to the building. That's certainly a very good start, but...I believe the biggest key in all planning is the aware-ness, the maintenance and ongoing communication about it."</p>
<p>The communication can't be a monologue. There is nothing more important than open communication with direct feedback from employees.</p>
<p>It's also not about fearmongering, he insists.</p>
<p>"What we need to do is get rid of arrogance."</p>
<p>When business leaders dismiss science and the reality that it's not a matter of if, but when, there are bound to be negative consequences.</p>
<p>"You really have to look at your essential services, critical processes and functions and how well your people are supported, trained and how they can sustain a blow," says Klay.</p>
<p>Employees who are given this kind of training, and a thorough understanding of a company's comprehensive contingency plan, are more likely to respond rationally instead of out of panic.</p>
<p>Wilson, speaking at a recent conference, asked the crowd of about 50 business leaders if they had a practised pandemic response plan. Less than a quarter put up their hand.</p>
<p>Aside from cuts, Wilson says, an-other major barrier to developing a sound disaster plan is the very nature of how companies operate.</p>
<p>"In a very short term-focused market economy, this stuff doesn't seem to give you the wide return on investment," he says.</p>
<p>Wilson argues, however, that implementing many of the programs and backup plans that should be part of any good disaster plan actually do have payoffs.</p>
<p>"This brings together legal, HR, compensation, your communications team, what you say to shareholders as much as what you say to customers and employees,"says Wilson. "It is really a very broad-based ...strategy to put together."</p>
<p>He refers to it as enterprise resilience and says it goes far beyond paying insurance premiums.</p>
<p>"Being enterprise-resilient isn't just an insurance policy," he says. "It's a method of becoming very nimble, and certainly that's what you have to be these days if you're going to survive and grow."</p>
<p>It should not be approached merely as risk mitigation, but rather as steps you can take to ensure your business is more sustainable and able to respond quickly and effectively to whatever is thrown your way.</p>
<p>Wilson and Klay doubt there would be much tolerance for a company that simply closed shop until an event passed.</p>
<p>"You cannot just abolish the company," says Klay.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexican competitors weather storm</b>
</div><div>Rita Mingo   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>698 words</div><div>10 June 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>F2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Over the past couple of months, the mere mention of Mexico has elicited feelings of apprehension throughout the world. The emergence and subsequent mayhem caused by swine flu--or more correctly H1N1--has turned this enticing resort paradise into its own little hell.</p>
<p>Enrique Gonzalez-who hails from Mexico City--has been in the eye of the storm and has witnessed firsthand the economic devastation his homeland has suffered.</p>
<p>Gonzalez is one of a dozen Mexican riders who, along with 52 horses, have made the trip to Calgary to compete at the Spruce Meadows summer show jumping circuit, beginning with the 2009 National tournament, which gets underway today.</p>
<p>Their representation at the tournament and the subsequent Alberta tour was in doubt, if only for a little while.</p>
<p>"I think it was more of a panic situation,'' reasoned Gonzalez, who fortunately didn't know anyone who succumbed to the illness. "We just ended up realizing how many people die because of the flu every year.''</p>
<p>According to the latest numbers put forth by the World Health Organization, more than 19,000 people in 64 countries have been affected by the strain, thus propelling the WHO closer to labelling it a global pandemic.</p>
<p>But Mexico has borne the brunt of the fatalities, with 97 deaths reported.</p>
<p>"Of course, we were showing at a horse show when it came down,'' Gonzalez explained,"and we were all a little bit afraid for the first couple of days. It was unfortunate for our country. Our tourism is a very important part of the economy and it was very much affected. At that time, tourism is usually at 40 to 60 per cent and it went down to seven per cent. ''</p>
<p>Some reports, in fact, estimate that Mexico has lost $1 billion in revenues since the outbreak.</p>
<p>Like most everyone did when word of the flu began to spread, Spruce Meadows went into high alert.</p>
<p>"I think one of the fortunate things is that Spruce Meadows is not unfamiliar with dealing with issues that make their way into the headlines . . . hoof-and-mouth, West Nile virus,'' suggested Ian Allison, vice-president of television and media services at the venue. "There is always so much speculation that it impacts the way you deal with it. We've learned to sort through the information that's out there and deal with the situation with accurate information."</p>
<p>Not only does this dilemma touch Spruce Meadows in terms of the international athletes, but as well the labour pool it employs.</p>
<p>"We've worked very closely with Customs and Immigration as well as the health authorities in dealing with this threat, so that the logistics and advance planning is able to come to fruition,'' Allison said. "The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of risks we deal with every day. But we took this seriously.''</p>
<p>A Spruce Meadows tournament without Mexican representation would be incongruous, as people like Gonzalez, Federico Fernandez and Jaime Azcarraga have become among the more popular entrants.</p>
<p>"For us, it's very important,''Gonzalez, a member of his nation's 2008 Olympic squad, insisted. "As you know, Mexico is a little far from everywhere, so Spruce Meadows is our main international venue where riders can show. If not there, there's Palm Beach or we can go to Europe.</p>
<p>"But Spruce Meadows is where we go to do our trials for the Olympics, the Pan Am Games and the World championships. We have all of our best horses and we always want to do the best we can at the National and the North American. Our goal is to try to qualify for the grand prix.''</p>
<p>A plane carrying 42 horses--the others followed by truck--landed at the airport on the weekend in preparation for the National. The outfit will call Calgary home for the next four weeks, taking in all the major shows in the summer tour.</p>
<p>"It's great to have the Mexicans here,''Allison said. "They've done such a tremendous job in terms of depth with their horses and riders.And they embrace Spruce Meadows.''</p>

<p>F ears and complications surrounding the H1N1 virus means some inter-national students are cancelling their plans to study at Alberta post-secondary schools this summer.</p>
<p>Alberta Advanced Education says there is a decline in student enrolment in international summer programming, but says the drop isn't significant enough to warrant action on the part of government.</p>
<p>Some of the decline may also be caused by the faltering global economy, but early indications are that enrolment in fall programs will not be affected, said Alberta Advanced Education and Technology spokeswoman Rachel Bouska.</p>
<p>But the decrease in summer international enrolments in Alberta comes as the World Health Organization hinted Tuesday it may declare an H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Mount Royal College, roughly 60 students fromMexicoandChinarecently cancelled plans to attend the campus in June and July due to H1N1.</p>
<p>"For this year, it's just one of those unfortunate world events over which we have no control,"said Lorna Smith, director of the international education program at MRC.</p>
<p>Forty-one participants from a university in Mexico were supposed to begin studying at Mount Royal this month, but their university shut its doors in April due to H1N1. That made the trip difficult to organize, Smith said. The Mexican university is planning to send students this fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 18 participants from the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics won't be heading to Mount Royal in July as their university has imposed a temporary ban on all travel due to H1N1. Smith said students from the university will likely attend the August immersion program.</p>
<p>"The universities have to be very cautious and risk-averse because they're responsible for the lives of students to the parents," Smith said.</p>
<p>"I think that's why they tend to be more cautious when they're sponsoring an exchange program," Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith said the cancellations mean budget targets for the summer program at Mount Royal won't be met, but she hopes to make up the shortfall with other projects during the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The WHO says the number of countries reporting lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 stood at 73 Tuesday, with 26,563 cases, including 249 deaths.</p>
<p>There are 171 confirmed cases in Alberta as of Monday. One person in northern Alberta with H1N1 has died.</p>
<p>Other post-secondary schools have also seen international students cancel summer plans.</p>
<p>At the University of Lethbridge, a group of 25 students from a high school in Japan won't be heading to the city this July due to concerns about H1N1.</p>
<p>"They cancelled right when it was the heat of the news and parents were concerned," said Laurel Corbiere, the director of the international centre.</p>
<p>The University of Calgary, however, says it hasn't seen any discernible drop in international student enrolment this summer.</p>
<p>At the height of H1N1 worries, the university did cancel a sociology field trip to Mexico, spokeswoman Colleen Turner said.</p>
<p>While H1N1 has instigated the cancellation of several trips, the drop in international student enrolment this summer may also be caused by worldwide economic woes, said Bouska.</p>
<p>"They've gone through this before (with) avian flu and SARS and 9/11, a lot of extraneous factors," she said of Alberta postsecondary institutions. "They're used to operating under the same principles that applied to those circumstances."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'I accepted her apology and I need to move on'; Aglukkaq wants to focus on job, not on minister's remarks</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>824 words</div><div>10 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has accepted cabinet colleague Lisa Raitt's apology for disparaging remarks that were caught on an audio tape and says she's putting the ordeal behind her so she can concentrate on her work.</p>
<p>"I need to focus. The health and safety of Canadians is the No. 1 priority here, and I take my role very seriously and I'm not going to let that situation affect how I work with her on these files," Aglukkaq said Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Friday, Raitt, the natural resources minister, phoned Aglukkaq and told her of the impending publication of a newspaper report about a tape recording of a conversation between Raitt and her communications director that wound up in the hands of a reporter.</p>
<p>On the tape, Raitt said she was "disappointed" by the health minister, suggested the former Nunavut health minister wasn't up to the challenges of Parliament Hill. Raitt also expressed the hope that Aglukkaq would never have to stickhandle a high-profile issue.</p>
<p>The communications director, Jasmine MacDonnell, lost her bid in court Monday to block the story, and the tape recording was released publicly.</p>
<p>When asked if she was shocked by Raitt's comments, Aglukkaq said, "I was, but I was really thankful that she called me before I heard it from anyone else.</p>
<p>"I accepted her apology and I need to move on because I have huge issues to deal with and I can't let that affect how I'm dealing with the situation and I just need, basically, to move on."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq and Raitt are both rookie ministers who were elected to the House of Commons in the last federal election. Their portfolios overlap on the supply of medical isotope, which are used in cancer treatments and diagnoses and other critical procedures.</p>
<p>The Chalk River nuclear, which produces one-half the world's medical isotopes, has been shut down. Raitt is the lead minister on the file, but Aglukkaq also takes questions on it during question period in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>In January, when the recording was accidentally made, the government was facing questions about a leak at the reactor that had been detected a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p>Raitt said Aglukkaq and her staff were "terrified of the issues," and she was pleased because she would be able to take the credit for solving the lingering isotope shortage.</p>
<p>"Oh, God, she's such a capable woman, but it's hard for her to come out of a co-operative government into this rough and tumble. She had a question in the House yesterday, or two days ago, that planked. I really hope she never gets anything hot," Raitt is heard to say.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq, who served six years as a municipal councillor and five years as a member of the legislative assembly in Nunavut, where she was finance minister, health minister and status of women minister, said her background in consensus politics served her well when she did end up with a "hot" issue such as the H1N1 human swine-flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"I applied what I knew best, and that is to work in co-operation with not just my opposition critics, but all the provinces and territories, and the international community, in getting the messaging out," she said.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq did earn the appreciation of her opposition critics for her handling of the H1N1 outbreak, and the New Democratic Party's health critic, Judy Wasylycia-Leis, says she has worked well with the health minister on several other matters.</p>
<p>"I found it was a wonderful change from my dealings with previous health ministers," Wasylycia-Leis said. "I found that she listened to concerns and tried to address them."</p>
<p>She said Aglukkaq may not be as articulate or as quick with a sound bite as some of her colleagues, but her more quiet and calm demeanour didn't mean she was incompetent.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said the Conservatives would have been better off putting Aglukkaq in charge of the isotope issue.</p>
<p>"We need the frankness and the compassion and the thoughtfulness of Leona brought to the isotope crisis, if we're ever going to get through it," she said.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq, whose son Cooper will turn one next week, also suggested that some people may underestimate her.</p>
<p>"I think people think that, because I come from a territory of 30,000 people, I'm not experienced, but I've been in government for over 20 years, and I've been a minister for the last six years, and I think I bring a unique perspective to the table and a unique approach," she said.</p>

Aglukkaq acknowledges shock at the taped comments, but says she's
glad Lisa Raitt called her before they became public.

<div>The Ottawa Citizen; with files from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>958 words</div><div>10 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>With the world teetering on the edge of the declaration of a flu pandemic, the city's public health unit now says 37 schools have reported suspected cases of H1N1, up from 29 schools last Thursday.</p>
<p>As well, 107 people had tested positive for H1N1, almost double the 56 people who tested positive as of last Thursday. About half were under the age of 16.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said Tuesday that the world was getting "very, very close" to a swine flu pandemic. Under WHO guidelines, a key criteria for declaring a pandemic is community spread outside the first region in which the disease was reported.</p>
<p>In this case, that is outside the Americas. So far, 1,211 cases have been recorded, for example, in Australia. In all, 26,563 infections including 140 deaths have been reported from 73 countries.</p>
<p>"One of the critical issues is that we do not want people to panic if they hear that we are in a pandemic situation," Feiji Fukuda, WHO's acting assistant director-general, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As of Monday, a total of 2,446 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus have been reported in all provinces and territories in Canada except Newfoundland.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Public Health Unit says officials are now unable, in some cases, to trace the spread of the virus from one person to another, a development that experts say is a sign of an impending pandemic.</p>
<p>"We are seeing cases in Ottawa with no specific link to another person. It has been happening in Ontario. That is what we call community spread," Sherry Nigro, the manager responsible for pandemic planning at Ottawa Public Health, said last week. "We know that it is fairly transmittable and we know that we are not going to prevent it so what we have to do is minimize it."</p>
<p>The growth in the number of cases, and concerns about the spread of the illness in the region, has prompted CHEO to issue a set of guidelines for parents rattled by reports of H1N1 in schools and who are contemplating a trip to the emergency room.</p>
<p>CHEO's emergency room has been busier-than-expected with an increased number of patients with flu-like illness, said Dr. Ken Farion, associate medical director of CHEO's emergency department.</p>
<p>Just because a child has flu-like symptoms, however, doesn't mean they have H1N1. Usually the flu season has tapered off by now, but this year there are a number of flu strains making the rounds, said Farion.</p>
<p>"If you're sick, stay at home to prevent the spread of all infections -- not just this one," he said.</p>
<p>"Most of what we're seeing is milder disease. They have a fever and they have a cough, but they're still able to get around and eat and drink. If this is the case, they should stay at home."</p>
<p>Farion said parents should be concerned if their child has difficulty breathing, there are concerns that the child has become dehydrated because of lack of fluids, if the child is extremely listless or if there is an underlying health condition such as immune system weakness or a respiratory condition.</p>
<p>Parents should also be concerned if a child with mild to moderate symptoms appears to get better, then gets worse. The flu may have caused a weakening of the immune system, leading to a secondary infection such as bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>Many parents are bringing their child to the emergency room to seek testing, but this is usually only done if the child has an underlying condition.</p>
<p>"Showing up doesn't mean you're going to get tested," said Farion</p>
<p>"Because we're not testing the vast majority of patients, whether they have Flu 1 or Flu 2 isn't really relevant. The focus should be on symptom management."</p>
<p>The vast majority of CHEO patients with flu-like symptoms are being discharged to home with the instructions that they may have H1N1 or another flu. CHEO has only admitted about one or two flu patients a day, and these are often children with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Farion said most healthy children with the flu are ill for four or five days and are significantly improved within a week. For infants and toddlers and children with underlying conditions, it may take longer to recover.</p>
<p>Children and families who arrive at the CHEO emergency department are screened for febrile respiratory illness. Those who have symptoms will be directed to a separate isolation area to see a nurse wearing full protective equipment. These extra measures mean it takes staff longer to see patients, and the sickest patients will be seen first.</p>
<p>Farion advises parents who decide to visit the emergency room to ensure healthy siblings stay at home.</p>
<p>"We don't need the volume and congestion," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the emergency room at the Queensway-Carleton Hospital has had a "record week" -- but only a tiny proportion of the patients have been ill with the flu and the hospital is still puzzling over what caused the bump in numbers, said chief of emergency Dr. John Earle.</p>
<p>One day last week, for example, the emergency department logged 230 visits when a normal flow would be 185 patients.</p>
<p>"It's usually what you would see on July 1 or Boxing Day," he said.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>There were more signs yesterday that poor, remote aboriginal communities are being hit especially hard by H1N1 flu, prompting some aboriginal leaders to accuse the federal government of leaving them with little help. Another 28 cases were confirmed in Nunavut, more than doubling the amount overnight in the sparsely populated territory, bringing the total to 53. Six people were in hospital, but officials would not reveal details of their condition. In Manitoba, an 18-month-old boy from the Garden Hill First Nation was hospitalized, Chief David Harper said, and there were concerns for the 10 other people who live in the cramped home.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Raitt disses Prentice; Says environment minister pandering to Alberta</b>
</div><div>Alexander Panetta   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>638 words</div><div>10 June 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A09</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Yet another federal minister has been subjected to a less than flattering assessment from Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt, as Conservatives brace for what else might emerge from her audiotaped musings.</p>
<p>The latest subject of Raitt's off-the-cuff utterances into an inconveniently placed tape recorder: Environment Minister Jim Prentice.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the five hours of audiotape obtained by a Halifax newspaper say Raitt suggests her colleague is pandering to Alberta's oilsands.</p>
<p>Two sources say Raitt is heard speaking dismissively about the environment minister, and one says she refers specifically to policy that favours oil companies.</p>
<p>It would be a particularly surprising observation because Raitt is responsible for defending the oilsands, while Prentice is responsible for reducing Canada's carbon emissions.</p>
<p>That news comes one day after another snippet of tape surfaced in which Raitt questioned the abilities of Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>"This will be the gift that keeps on giving," was the sarcastic assessment from one government official.</p>
<p>"What else is on these five hours?"</p>
<p>He says the Conservatives are prepared to weather more unwanted headlines from a five-hour audio tape obtained by the Halifax Chronicle Herald.</p>
<p>In the first such story, the newspaper quoted Raitt suggesting the health minister would be incapable of dealing with a political hot potato. This was before Aglukkaq won plaudits even from political opponents for the way she handled the swine flu panic.</p>
<p>Both of the colleagues discussed on the tape rallied to Raitt's defence yesterday.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq did it in the House of Commons and, before news emerged that he'd also come up in the recording, Prentice did it with reporters on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>The environment minister praised the way Raitt had handled a medical isotope crisis triggered by problems at the nuclear reactor in Chalk River, Ont.</p>
<p>"(Raitt) is a very hard working minister on a very difficult file and she's a valued colleague," Prentice said outside the Commons.</p>
<p>"She has been working very hard on this issue from the time that she became a minister."</p>
<p>Colleagues have, in fact, raved about Raitt's performance around the cabinet table.</p>
<p>A mere eight months into her career as an elected politician, several are already touting her as a future leadership contender -- provided that she becomes fluent in French.</p>
<p>Two ministers have described Raitt's interventions around the table as smart and well-researched.</p>
<p>The former head of Toronto's port authority has also impressed peers with witty, unscripted responses in House of Commons debates where others plod awkwardly through pre-written crib sheets.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper has staked his own political capital on helping her weather the current controversy.</p>
<p>The prime minister leaped to his feet in an energetic defence of his minister yesterday, and there wasn't a word of apology from the Tory benches for Raitt's musings that the medical crisis could help her career.</p>
<p>Harper has been less forgiving of other ministers.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz was forced to make an immediate, late-night apology before a phalanx of television cameras during last fall's federal election when news emerged that he'd joked about the Listeria crisis.</p>
<p>Maxime Bernier was dumped as foreign affairs minister when he left documents at his girlfriend's house.</p>
<p>One Conservative staffer said the document fiasco was a handy pretext to dump the underperforming Bernier -- and that Raitt is in a different league.</p>
<p>"Look, she's a competent minister, she's a woman, and she's from Ontario," he said.</p>
<p>"You don't throw her under the bus unless you absolutely have to. ... Do you really want to sacrifice a capable, female, Ontario cabinet minister unless you absolutely have to?"</p>

</div><div>By Bruce Owen   </div>

</p>
<p>SOME First Nations on the east side of the province will withdraw from a historic accord signed with the Doer government just two years ago if the NDP tries to pass its controversial Bill 6 by Thursday.</p>
<p>Sydney Garrioch, grand chief of the Manitoba Keewatinook Ininew Okimowin, said the bands will pull out of the Wabanong Nakaygum Okimawin (WNO) governance process if the province does not defer the bill to the fall sitting of the legislature.</p>
<p>The furor over Bill 6, the East Side Traditional Lands Planning and Special Protected Areas Act, erupted late last week when the government, in a deal with the Tory opposition, included Bill 6 in a package of bills to be passed by Thursday when the session ends.</p>
<p>A committee meeting to get the needed public input was arranged, but its scheduling left little time for the leaders of the 16 bands to come to Winnipeg. Chief David McDougall of St. Theresa Point First Nation was also involved in a serious H1N1 outbreak in his community.</p>
<p>The apparent rush to pass the bill upset many First Nations leaders because it was not in keeping with the WNO agreement, which enshrined a process where the province and east side bands would deal with one another on a government-to-government basis.</p>
<p>Conservation Minister Stan Struthers said Tuesday the province believes it has addressed the bands' concerns with two last-minute amendments to Bill 6.</p>

<p>Re: Pandemic Panic, Lorne Gunter, June 8.</p>
<p>I've been following the swine flu "pandemic" with some interest. As a mathematician, however, it is very frustrating that the data reported are horribly inconsistent. Unfortunately, Mr. Gunter's column does not help the situation.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Gunter reports that, according to that U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the official tally of swine flu cases in the United States is "nearly 5,000." However, when checking the CDC Web site, I see that it reports the tally as high as 13,217 as of June 5. Furthermore, Mr. Gunter reports only five deaths from swine flu in the United States while the CDC reports 27.</p>
<p>As for the "fact" that nearly 6,000 Canadians die each year from the flu: According to CDC's own numbers, influenza was listed as the underlying cause of only 849 deaths in the United States in 2006 (the most recent year that data is available). Though I can't find data on Canadian death rates, I doubt Canada would have over seven times more flu deaths annually than the United States with only with one-ninth of the population.</p>
<p>Sure, it's colder here and the winters are longer, but Mr. Gunter's numbers would mean that Canada has roughly 63 times as many flu deaths per person than the United States.</p>

<p>GITMO INMATE IN U.S. FOR TRIAL</p>
<p>NEW YORK - The first inmate transferred from Guantanamo Bay to American soil arrived in New York on Tuesday, where he will stand trial for allegedly organizing bomb attacks on two U.S. embassies.</p>
<p>Ahmed Ghailani, a Tanzanian and alleged former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden, was escorted to the Metropolitan Correction Centre in Manhattan.</p>
<p>He was due to appear in a federal court, charged with involvement in the attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.</p>
<p>The trial will be a key test of President Barack Obama's plan to close the Guantanamo detention centre within seven months and place some of its 240 foreign inmates on trial.</p>
<p>Ghailani, 35, arrived in Guantanamo in September 2006 after being captured in Pakistan two years earlier. He was charged in 1998 over the embassy attacks in which 224 people -- 12 of them Americans -- died.</p>
<p>He faces 286 counts of murder and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against Americans, charges that carry the death penalty.</p>

<p>SIX CONVICTED IN MURDER OF BOY</p>
<p>LONDON - Six members of a teenage gang were found guilty on Tuesday of the unprovoked murder of a 14-year-old boy near his home in east London.</p>
<p>Shaquille Smith had been out late in the evening with his 16-year-old sister and an 18-year-old friend in a park in Hackney in August last year.</p>
<p>They were attacked shortly before midnight by the gang, who police said had set off on their bicycles looking for someone to "roll" or beat up.</p>
<p>A witness described the attackers, from the London Fields Gang, as acting like a "pack of dogs" as they swarmed across the park and climbed over a fence to get in, police said.</p>
<p>Shaquille's friend escaped but his sister was slashed across the face with a knife. The gang punched and kicked Shaquille and then stabbed him in the stomach. He died in hospital the next morning.</p>
<p>LONDON HIT BY RAIL STRIKE</p>
<p>LONDON - Millions of London commuters and visitors to the capital face two days of transport disruption after a 48-hour strike shut down the underground rail network on Tuesday evening in a dispute over pay and jobs.</p>
<p>London Mayor Boris Johnson condemned the walkout by thousands of drivers, station staff, maintenance workers as "utterly demented." He said: "We will do everything in our power to keep this city on the move." Extra buses would be provided, Oyster prepay travel cards would be accepted on overground rail links and temporary parking would be set up for the thousands expected to cycle, he said.</p>
<p>HELICOPTER HASH RING SMASHED</p>
<p>MADRID - Spanish police arrested 17 people in an operation against a drug smuggling ring that used a helicopter to bring large amounts of hashish from Morocco into Spain, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"As a cover for their illegal activities and to obtain the necessary flight authorizations, the organization ran a helicopter services company which, under the pretext of carrying out photo shoots, transported drugs," police said in a statement.</p>
<p>Police seized 2,720 kilos of hashish, a helicopter, nine vehicles, electrical equipment and US$28,000 in cash as part of the operation which got underway late last year.</p>
<p>EX-SERB SPY CHIEF RAN MURDER SQUADS</p>
<p>THE HAGUE - Special units allegedly run by ex-Serb intelligence chief Jovica Stanisic and an accomplice acted as if they had a "licence to murder," during the Bosnian war, a UN war crimes court heard Tuesday.</p>
<p>The units organized by Stanisic and co-accused Franko Simatovic, each on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity, believed they were entitled to both kill and reclaim land from people, alleged prosecutor Dermot Groome at the UN's Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</p>
<p>A video in which members of one such group, known as the Scorpions, killed three men and three boys at point blank range after the fall of the Srebrenica enclave in Bosnia in 1995, was also shown to the court.</p>

<p>GUATEMALA CITY - Guatemala was Tuesday to consider advancing school vacations as part of measures to contain the spread of swine flu, after cases of A(H1N1) rose to 60 in one week.</p>
<p>Vice-president Rafael Espada said the health and education ministries would propose starting school holidays on Friday instead of in the last week of June.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be surprised if we had more than 100 cases at the end of the month, because that's how this kind of epidemic behaves," Espada said at a meeting of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>Congress was also considering removing taxes on antiviral medicines, said Roberto Alejos, the parliament's leader.</p>
<p>Guatemala's health minister announced 10 new swine flu cases Monday, bringing the total to 60 cases in the Central American country, of which 48 have totally recovered.</p>
<p>ASYLUM GIVEN TO PROTEST LEADER</p>
<p>MANAGUA - Nicaragua's leftist government has granted political asylum to Peruvian indigenous leader Alberto Pizango, wanted in Lima on charges he fomented protests against Amazon oil exploration that killed 60 people.</p>
<p>Nicaragua's ambassador in Peru, Tomas Borge, told Reuters on Tuesday that Pizango sought asylum in the Nicaraguan Embassy in the Peruvian capital.</p>
<p>Thousands of Indians armed with wooden spears fought Peruvian security forces in two days of battles last week in the worst unrest of President Alan Garcia's government.</p>
<p>"We ask for the understanding of the Peruvian government and a few moments ago I rang to reiterate (to Pizango) that we have given him asylum," Borge said, adding that Nicaragua would ask for his safe passage out of Peru.</p>

<p>HAMAS CHIEF SAYS ARRESTS HINDER UNITY</p>
<p>CAIRO - Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal said on Tuesday that arrests in the West Bank of the group's militants by forces loyal to president Mahmud Abbas were hindering efforts at reconciliation between the two sides.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Meshaal, who arrived for unity talks in Cairo, said he perceived a "change in tone" from the United States toward the Palestinian question after a speech last week by President Barack Obama but that he still wants to see a new U.S. policy.</p>
<p>Only Tuesday, West Bank police arrested six Hamas members suspected of planning acts against the Palestinian Authority and seized more than a US$1.4 million from them, a senior official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tensions between Hamas, which controls besieged Gaza, and the Fatah movement of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas have risen, with four policemen, four Hamas militants and a civilian killed in the West Bank since May 31.</p>
<p>Hamas ousted forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza in a week of deadly street-fighting in June 2007.</p>
<p>U.S. HOLDING 11,000 PRISONERS IN IRAQ</p>
<p>BAGHDAD - The U.S. army said Tuesday it was holding around 11,000 prisoners in Iraq, all of whom will either be freed or handed to Iraqi authorities in line with a security accord between Baghdad and Washington.</p>
<p>In total, 11,057 people are being detained in three prisons run by U.S. forces at Camp Cropper and Camp Taji, which are in and around Baghdad, and Camp Bucca, which is in southern Iraq, a statement said.</p>
<p>"Once the total detainee population drops below 8,000, the theatre internment facility at Camp Bucca will close and all detainees will be held at Camps Cropper and Taji," it said.</p>
<p>Camp Taji is set to be handed over to Iraqi control early next year, while Camp Cropper is expected to be transferred in August 2010.</p>
<p>Tuesday's figure is a drop of around 2,000 on the number announced in March, when the United States said around half of the 13,000 Iraqi prisoners in its custody were considered dangerous.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, detainees considered less of a threat have been freed or transferred to Iraqi authorities at a rate of around 50 a day.</p>
<p>LEBANON CHARGES THREE WITH SPYING</p>
<p>BEIRUT - Lebanon's military prosecutor charged three more suspects on Tuesday with spying for Israel, continuing a crackdown on spy rings that has now seen a total of 58 people charged, a judicial official said.</p>
<p>The three are accused of "collaborating with the Israeli enemy," the official said. One of them is already in custody, while the others remain at large.</p>
<p>Of the 58 charged overall, 35 are in custody. They include a retired general and a policeman.</p>

<p>"The aircraft went missing after it took off from Mechuka air base," said Indian air force spokesman Ranjit Sahu in Guwahati, the largest city in northeast India.</p>
<p>Others said the aircraft may have crashed because of heavy rains in Arunachal Pradesh, a massive swathe of Indian territory which is claimed by adjoining China.</p>

<p>POLICE STATION TURNS INTO SNAKEPIT</p>
<p>FREETOWN - Law enforcers in Sierra Leone are used to slithering low life but the invasion of a police station by hundreds of hissing serpents has left even some of the toughest officers afraid to go to work.</p>
<p>An estimated 400 snakes, mostly cobras and vipers, have infested the station in the town of Gerihun in Sierra Leone's southern Bo district.</p>
<p>Residents also complain that they are too afraid of the snakes to go there to report crimes.</p>
<p>"(The snakes) have been in the ... police station since January and despite fumigating exercises carried out by officials of the Ministry of Health, many of the reptiles have not been dislodged," Town Chief Momoh Fornah told AFP in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The authorities are now looking to bring in army sharp-shooters to dispatch the unwelcome guests, he added.</p>
<p>Police officers at the station said the presence of the snakes had left many of them too afraid to work from their desks.</p>
<p>"We constantly hear hisses and weird sounds from the roof and we are always restless," said one police officer.</p>

</p>
<p>Airline losses worldwide may total $9 billion in 2009, nearly double a previous forecast, as an outbreak of swine flu compounds the effects of the recession, the industry's main trade group said.</p>
<p>Sales may fall 15 per cent to $448 billion this year from $528 billion in 2008, the International Air Transport Association said in a statement distributed at its annual meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.</p>
<p>"This is the most difficult situation that the industry has faced," IATA CEO Giovanni Bisignani said. "Our future depends on a drastic reshaping by partners, governments and industry."</p>
<p>The recession has hammered premium-class traffic as business travellers switch to cheaper seats, forcing British Airways Plc and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. to losses. China Eastern Airlines Corp. and Shanghai Airlines Co., plan to combine to cut competition in the world's fastest-growing aviation market and help both carriers return to profit.</p>
<p>There's "nothing we can do in the current environment to stimulate traffic, particularly in the premium market," said British Air's CEO Willie Walsh. "It doesn't respond to pricing activity."</p>
<p>Passenger traffic may fall by eight per cent and cargo demand will slump 17 per cent, IATA said. The group was forecasting an industry loss of about $4.7 billion for 2009 as recently as March 24.</p>
<p>Carriers in North America may report a loss of $1 billion for the year, IATA said, reversing a prediction of a profit of $100 million for the region's airlines.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>China goes high tech to halt cheating on entrance exams; Ten million students compete in national college entrance exam</b>

</p>
<p>The ordeal ended Monday for 10.2 million teens across China who were taking the national college entrance examinations.</p>
<p>The three-day gaokao, as the exams are called, are considered key to the future prosperity of kids lucky enough to score well on the test. The better a student does in the tests, the better university he or she will be able to attend and the better the job prospects after graduation.</p>
<p>At least that was the theory until this year's economic downturn left at least one million -- close to 20 per cent of the 2008 cohort -- unemployed.</p>
<p>Still, the pressure on students to do well in the gaokao is unbelievable and it has become a national obsession to find ways to help them ease the tension.</p>
<p>Zhang Jian, 45, admits his 19-year-old daughter Wen has been sweating it in the last few weeks as she crammed for the gaokao and that the family has had to be extra supportive.</p>
<p>"In China, the college entrance exam is like a barrier in everyone's life. Everyone needs to cross it, but there are far more choices now than before," he said as he waited for her at the gate of the East China Model High School to complete her second day of tests. "Failing the exam doesn't mean the end of life. It can be a door to another road and a new start."</p>
<p>Extra traffic police were stationed around Shanghai's 114 testing centres to deal with tie-ups that might prevent a student from starting an exam on time. Still more police and security guards were stationed outside the exam halls to discourage beeping horns and noisy pedestrians.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the intense pressure of the gaokao sometimes leads to cheating and authorities are going to great lengths this year to prevent it. For the first time, video cameras were installed in some 60,000 examination halls to monitor the students as they puzzled over math problems, questions on Chinese literature and arcane points of English language usage.</p>
<p>As well, each student has to pass through an electronic scanner before entering the test room. They were being checked for things like cellphones and radio receivers that could be used to connect to the outside world.</p>
<p>Even more ominously, officials said they were monitoring the "electromagnetic environment" around the test centres, in an effort to detect and deflect any new forms of electronic cheating.</p>
<p>The paranoia didn't end with cheating, either. China is still on high alert for the H1N1 virus and more than a little concerned about large gatherings, even in an exam room. In a bid to prevent a mass outbreak of swine flu, each student was asked to fill in a health form and immediately report fevers, coughs or flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where 73,800 students are sitting the exams, two teens were found to be feverish on Sunday and are now taking their tests in isolation.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Economic meltdown shakes airlines; Carriers will lose $9 billion in '09, IATA says</b>

<div>510 words</div><div>9 June 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>E7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Desperate attempts by carriers around the globe to stimulate demand for air travel with lower fares have fallen flat, creating the most challenging revenue environment in the history of the industry, according to the head of International Air Transport Association.</p>
<p>"There is no modern precedent for today's economic meltdown," said Giovanni Bisignani, IATA chief executive, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Monday. "The ground has shifted. Our industry has been shaken. This is the most difficult situation that the industry has faced."</p>
<p>Leaders of the world's largest airlines have collected in the Malaysian capital this week at IATA's annual general meeting to discuss their challenges.</p>
<p>Bisignani noted that after 9/11, revenue fell by about seven per cent. But this year, industry sales are expected fall by about 15 per cent, or the equivalent of $80 billion US, on weaker demand and lower prices that will more than offset its lower fuel bill this year, which is expected to fall by $53 billion US.</p>
<p>The industry as a whole is expecting to fly 180 million fewer passengers this year due to the weak economy, IATA said.</p>
<p>There's "nothing we can do in the current environment to stimulate traffic, particularly in the premium market," British Airway chief executive Willie Walsh told Bloomberg. "It doesn't respond to pricing activity."</p>
<p>As a result, IATA expects the industry to report a collective loss of $9 billion US, up from its previous estimate of a $4.7-billion loss.</p>
<p>The industry group, which represents about 240 of the world's largest airlines, said it also expects North American carriers to report $1-billion US loss this year, down from the modest profit it had expected of $100 million due to their capacity cuts.</p>
<p>Canadian carriers are also affected. Air Canada said Monday its traffic fell by 10.3 per cent in May, outpacing its capacity cuts. That resulted in its load factor--average amount of seats filled on its planes--falling by 3.7 percentage points to 79.5 per cent during the month compared to last year.</p>
<p>Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada chief executive, blamed the economy and the outbreak of swine flu during the month for the weak demand.</p>
<p>Its smaller domestic rival, <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>., has said it expects its revenue per available seat mile to fall between 16 and 18 per cent during the second quarter, up from its previous estimate of a 10-per-cent decline, due primarily to lower prices.</p>
<p>David Newman, National Bank Financial analyst, estimates WestJet's prices have been down 20 per cent so far in the second quarter, in line with Air Canada's 22-per-cent decline.</p>
<p>Air Canada's situation has been exacerbated by its mounting pension and debt obligations.</p>

<p>Chinese authorities have placed New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin under quarantine at a hotel in Shanghai, after a fellow passenger on his flight fell ill with a suspected case of swine flu, his office said.</p>
<p>Nagin, his wife Seletha and a security guard were "placed in a designated quarantine location in Shanghai and they remain symptom-free," Nagin's spokeswoman Ceeon Quiett said Sunday.</p>
<p>Another spokeswoman in the mayor's office told Agence France-Presse on Monday that the trio was still held at the location.</p>
<p>A passenger on Nagin's flight was "confirmed to have signs and symptoms of an influenza-like illness suspected to be of the H1N1 subtype and the passenger is undergoing quarantine and treatment," Quiett said.</p>
<p>Nagin was on a 10-day trip to China and Australia aimed at promoting business to his city.</p>
<p>He was also scheduled to deliver a keynote address and lead a climate change panel discussion at the University of Sydney, which is set to begin Thursday.</p>

</p>
<p>Continued weakness in travel demand and worries about H1N1 influenza clipped Air Canada's traffic by 10 per cent in May, disappointing analysts.</p>
<p>Air Canada, the nation's top carrier, reported a consolidated load factor, a measure of how many seats are filled, of 79.5 per cent, 3.7 percentage points lower than the same month last year.</p>
<p>Capacity, measured in available seat miles, fell 6.1 per cent to 4.85 billion, and traffic declined 10.3 per cent to 3.86 billion revenue passenger miles.</p>
<p>Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's president and chief executive, said the airline was "able to maintain a relatively stable performance during the month," despite downward pressure on travel demand due to the weakened economy and concern over the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>However, Jacques Kavafian, airlines analyst with <span class="companylink">Research Capital Corp</span>., said the traffic numbers aren't good.</p>
<p>The double-digit hit to traffic was well below his expectations. Kavafian added that although Air Canada doesn't provide unit revenue guidance in its traffic reports, U. S. airlines are reporting a 20 per cent drop in revenue per available seat mile, a key indicator of revenue growth.</p>
<p>"When you combine that with a traffic decline, May looks like an awful month from a revenue perspective," Kavafian suggested.</p>
<p>Last week, <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>., Canada's No. 2 airline, said it expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM)in the second quarter to fall 16 to 18 per cent on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p>Jazz, Air Canada's regional capacity provider, reported a May load factor of 65.6 per cent, a decrease of 6.8 percentage points.</p>
<p>Air Canada's main-line segment reported a load factor of 81 per cent, down 3.3 percentage points.</p>
<p>Main-line figures include Jetz, Air Canada's charter business, and Tier 3 flying, or small charters under contract to the carrier.</p>

</p>
<p>The recession and the flu took their toll on Montreal's hotel industry in May.</p>
<p>Tourisme Montréal said yesterday the number of rooms occupied during the month slumped 10.45 per cent to 333,250 from 372,122 the year before.</p>
<p>The recession was largely responsible and hit hard during the month, the tourist board said, but worries over the H1N1 virus also prompted some foreign visitors, particularly Asians, to skip business meetings being held here.</p>
<p>Results for June could also plummet, given the cancelling of the Montreal Grand Prix, traditionally the most lucrative weekend of the year. The rising value of the Canadian dollar and stricter rules requiring travellers crossing the U.S. border to have passports, could also discourage U.S. visitors.</p>
<p>The survey takes into account only the 75 hotels belonging to the Greater Montreal Hotel Association, but they constitute the bulk of the major hotels.</p>
<p>The number of rooms available this May was actually down from the year before, producing an occupancy rate of 63.41 this May compared with 70.79 last year. The average price of a room also slipped slightly to $132.12 from $139.09.</p>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>Manitoba health officials were investigating a sudden spike in the number of people requiring intensive care for flu-like illnesses yesterday, while Quebec reported its first death related to swine flu.</p>
<p>There were 26 Manitobans on ventilators due to flu as of Monday, and that's in addition to the 30 or so people who are on ventilators on an average day for a wide variety of illnesses.</p>
<p>The spike prompted the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority to order 15 additional machines.</p>
<p>"We're seeing a number of severe cases of influenza-like illness,'' said Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"What we've observed is really more severe than what we would expect to see or have seen with typical seasonal influenza in the past.''</p>
<p>While the vast majority of people who have contracted the flu have not required hospitalization, the new swine flu seems to be hitting certain groups hard -- aboriginals and people between 20 and 60, Kettner said.</p>
<p>Manitoba did not confirm any new cases of swine flu yesterday. The provincial total remains at 40, none of which has been fatal. But Kettner said he expects most, if not all, of the recent serious cases will test positive for swine flu.</p>
<p>More than half of those on ventilators as of yesterday were aboriginal.</p>
<p>Native leaders have warned that poor housing conditions make it hard to prevent a contagious disease from spreading. One of the hardest-hit communities is St. Theresa Point -- a fly-in reserve 500 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg where some two-bedroom homes house 10 or more people.</p>
<p>More than a dozen reserve residents have been hospitalized in recent weeks, including a pregnant woman who lost her child.</p>

<div>491 words</div><div>9 June 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Guelph MP Frank Valeriote said his first trip to Washington made him feel like a lobbyist as he urged U.S. agricultural officials to relax regulations currently costing Canadian farmers money.</p>
<p>Valeriote, a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, was joined by his committee colleagues to discuss issues surrounding Canada's agriculture and agri-food industry, specifically trade issues, food safety and the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>Most notably, Valeriote met with Minnesota congressman and chair of the committee on agriculture, Collin Peterson, among other influential heads of the U.S. agriculture industry.</p>
<p>The No. 1 issue was the new country-of-origin labelling regulations which require the segregation of Canadian and American meat at U.S. processing plants and some U.S. supermarkets and groceries.</p>
<p>Meat-processing plants in the U.S. cannot process American and Canadian beef and pork at the same time. Livestock from the two countries cannot be mixed during processing. And, when sold, U.S. laws require Canadian and American products to be labelled as such and sometimes sold in separate coolers, according to Valeriote.</p>
<p>American meat packers are passing the added expense of the country-of-origin labelling onto the American consumer or have stopped buying Canadian meat altogether and it's driving down the price of Canadian cattle and pork, sometimes by as much as $100 per head, according to Valeriote.</p>
<p>"Two things now happen: big packers, like Smithfield, which is the biggest hog packer in the States, have decided not to take Canadian hogs, or packers bid lower for Canadian beef and pork," said Kevin Grier of the George Morris Centre, Canada's No. 1 agricultural think-tank. "The goal was to make it harder to export Canadian cattle and meat. And it's been successful beyond my wildest expectations."</p>
<p>"They're blaming the H1N1 virus and mad cow disease," Valeriote said of American ranchers, processors and government, "but I think it's protectionism."</p>
<p>"He's right, it is solely about protectionism," Grier said. "The U.S. government says it's about the consumer's right to know where their food comes from, but every single retailer says the consumers don't care."</p>
<p>Valeriote is also calling on Prime Minister Stephen Harper's minority government to do more for the Canadian farmer.</p>
<p>"This is a huge issue for everyone," Valeriote said. "I try not to be partisan, but our prime minister has not raised the issue strongly enough.</p>
<p>"It deserves a trip by him to the US. to draw the attention of their federal, state and municipal governments. They're founded on 'buy American' and it costs us billions of dollars."</p>

</div><div>By Lindsey Wiebe   </div>

</p>
<p>The international community is on track to have an H1N1 vaccine ready by fall, said the scientific director of the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab.</p>
<p>"The global vaccine collection machinery are making good progress," said Dr. Frank Plummer, following a public lecture at the University of Winnipeg about the outbreak.</p>
<p>Officials say influenza viruses that surface around this time of year can fade out and resurface in the fall, sometimes in more severe mutations.</p>
<p>Plummer said pharmaceutical companies now have the seed stocks necessary to produce flu vaccines, and are in the midst of evaluating them to see which are best.</p>
<p>Plummer, who also acts as the chief science adviser for the Public Health Agency of Canada, said he expects those vaccines will be ready by about October.</p>
<p>The National Microbiology Laboratory is also testing four experimental vaccines, which he said are being evaluated for animal models.</p>
<p>In his lecture, Plummer discussed the laboratory's eight-week H1N1 saga, starting with a plea for help from a Mexican colleague in mid-April.</p>
<p>The weeks since have included hundreds of sample tests and two low-profile visits to Winnipeg by Mexico's presidential plane.</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderón's plane first touched down in Winnipeg at the end of April on a 3 a.m. flight to drop off 200 samples for testing.</p>
<p>"The staff in Winnipeg did a rather amazing job of working out the logistics here," Plummer said.</p>
<p>On the second visit just a few days later, a pair of Winnipeg scientists from the lab was whisked off to Mexico.</p>
<p>Their job was to help set up databases needed to organize huge volumes of information on the outbreak.</p>
<p>"They got to ride on the president's plane, eat off his china, drink out of his glasses, which was quite an experience for them," Plummer said. "They were tickled to do that."</p>
<p>Plummer said it's too early to speculate whether aboriginal people are more vulnerable to the H1N1 virus, despite the fact that it seems to be hitting hard in Manitoba's aboriginal population.</p>
<p>"The data just aren't there yet," he said.</p>
<p>Plummer praised the team of Canadians sent to Mexico to help deal with the outbreak along with their American and Mexican counterparts.</p>
<p>Trying to get new, expensive equipment up and running with a president wanting test results as soon as possible "is difficult to say the least," he said.</p>
<p>Scientists are now in wait-and-see mode as to what will happen with the virus next, Plummer said.</p>
<p>Typically, the flu fades out as summer begins, but he said he doesn't know if that will be the case this time around.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of work to do to get ready for the fall and the next influenza season," he said.</p>

<p>Air Canada's AC.B-T passenger traffic slid 10.3 per cent last month as the recession and concerns about swine flu eroded travel demand. The country's largest carrier said its May traffic, including its regional Jazz affiliate, amounted to 3.86 billion revenue passenger miles, compared with 4.31 billion in the same month last year. Air Canada's load factor, or the proportion of seats filled by paying customers, fell to 79.5 per cent from 83.2 per cent. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said yesterday that Air Canada mediator James Farley has been meeting with union officials. Mr. Flaherty noted there are multiple parties involved, including retirees. He appointed Mr. Farley last Thursday to intervene in the airline's dispute with labour leaders over the company's proposed moratorium on pension funding. AC.B-T (TSX) rose 2 cents to $1.41.</p>

<p>Public health officials are not advising the closure of schools even though the H1N1 virus keeps spreading in Manitoba because it would be counterproductive: If kids are off school, they might head to the mall, where transmission would continue. But, Joel Kettner, chief medical officer of health, said Monday parents should know that swine flu is everywhere: "I have no doubt it's in every school in Manitoba." Which is not to say that parents should be alarmed. Dr. Kettner stressed that even as the flu spreads here, very few people have become really sick.</p>
<p>A former director of public health, Dr. Greg Hammond, has suggested better information could be flowing through the schools. Parents, he said, ought to know when absenteeism reaches 10 per cent. It is a reasonable expectation that letters describing suspicions or confirming a 10 per cent rate flow home. If schools do not have such policies, they should. It sends home the message that parents should remind kids how best to avoid getting and spreading flu -- wash your hands, cover your coughs and if you're sick, stay home.</p>

</div><div>By Bruce Owen   </div>

</p>
<p>A rush by the province to push through a bill intended to give greater power to First Nations on the east side of Lake Winnipeg backfired on the Doer government Monday night.</p>
<p>Chief David Harper of Garden Hill First Nation said his band and two others in the Island Lake area of northern Manitoba -- currently dealing with the H1N1 flu outbreak -- will pull out of the East Side Traditional Lands Planning and Special Protected Areas Act if it passes as is by Thursday.</p>
<p>"If it proceeds, we don't want to be included," Harper told a special sitting of the legislative affairs committee Monday night. "The concerns of my people is that the bill does not rest with First Nations. The concern is it rests with government."</p>
<p>Harper said he was speaking for Chief Jerry Knott of Wasagamack First Nation and Chief David McDougall of St. Theresa Point First Nation. McDougall was not at the meeting -- a necessary stage in getting the bill passed -- because he was at the Health Sciences Centre with families of band members hit by H1N1.</p>
<p>Harper's comments are a huge setback for Premier Gary Doer's government. The NDP wanted to exit the spring session this week on high note, but have instead been stung by criticism from First Nation leaders over their handling of Bill 6.</p>
<p>The act was introduced before Christmas and heralded by the Doer government as a way to pave the way for a world heritage site on the east side of Lake Winnipeg. It would also effectively ban the construction of a hydro power line through the boreal forest.</p>
<p>The bill, promised by Doer in the 2007 election, will give 15 other bands on the east side unprecedented power to plan and manage their traditional lands that often extend thousands of square kilometres beyond their small reserves. No plan for a band's land will be approved without the signatures of the province and the band's chief.</p>
<p>But Harper said the province has never properly consulted with First Nations people, either in the crafting of Bill 6 or what it would mean to many isolated communities.</p>
<p>Harper and others also said the province did not give proper notice -- from less than 24 hours in some cases to none in others -- of the first committee hearing held last Thursday. The H1N1 outbreak also complicated travel plans for some leaders.</p>
<p>"A lot of the communities wanted to come down but couldn't because of the pandemic alert," Tory aboriginal and northern affairs critic Leanne Rowat said.</p>
<p>The bands, through Sydney Garrioch, grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinook Ininew Okimowin (MKO), an organization that represents northern First Nations in Manitoba, complained to the province the next day. A second round of committee hearings was quickly arranged for Monday night.</p>
<p>Harper also said the province has yet to explain how Bill 6 impacts the Wabanong Nakaygum Okimawin (WNO) governance process on the east side of the province. On April 3, 2007, the province and the WNO signed an accord confirming a government-to-government relationship between the two parties.</p>
<p>Harper said in the evolution of Bill 6, the WNO was not treated as an equal to the provincial government.</p>
<p>"It was not jointly developed on a government-to-government basis," he said.</p>
<p>The criticism forced Conservation Minister Stan Struthers to add two amendments to Bill 6: That it will not affect aboriginal treaty rights and that it will include the principles of the WNO.</p>

<p>THE government and the opposition have agreed that several bills, including the NDP's controversial balanced-budget legislation, will pass by this Thursday. Others bills will wait approval until this fall, including the Police Services Act, the Municipal Conflict of Interest and Campaign Financing Act, the <span class="companylink">Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation</span> Amendment Act (enhanced compensation for catastrophic injuries) and the Community Revitalization Tax Increment Financing Act.</p>
<p>NDP House Leader Dave Chomiak has said the government agreed to a change in its balanced-budget legislation. Bill 30 allowed the government to forego making minimum annual payments of $110 million on the provincial debt for three years. By agreement, the bill will be amended so that it is in force for only two years.</p>
<p>The legislative session resumes Sept. 14 and adjourns Oct. 8.</p>

<p>Many of the children who were off from school last week because of flu-like symptoms began returning to Massey School on Monday.</p>
<p>"There are no reports of any unusual activity at any of our other schools and Massey, I am very pleased to say, is starting to see the (student) numbers return to normal,'' said Regina Public Schools spokesman Terry Lazarou.</p>
<p>"We are not seeing the same high rate of absenteeism at the school as last week, but are still expecting some students to be away because we asked parents to keep anyone with flu-like symptoms at home for seven days.''</p>
<p>On Friday, school division officials said the absentee rate at Massey -- which has a student population just under 450 -- had risen to 200. As of Monday, there were five more confirmed cases of the H1N1 influenza virus at Massey bringing the total to seven.</p>
<p>However, health region officials had previously indicated the number is likely a lot higher as many of the students, if they were experiencing mild symptoms, would not have been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Lazarou said over the weekend the school division maintenance staff did some extensive cleaning of all the surfaces at Massey.</p>
<p>"(Things are) returning to normal for the last three weeks of school,'' Lazarou said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hog cull raises hopes; With infected herd destroyed, producers anticipate end to ban</b>
</div><div>Andrea Sands   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>758 words</div><div>8 June 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>An Alberta hog farmer's decision to cull his entire herd of 3,000 pigs should reopen borders closed to Alberta pork since the H1N1 flu virus infected his animals, says the head of Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>Late last week, Arnold Van Ginkel wiped out his whole herd to finally rid his farm of the virus and start fresh.</p>
<p>The province's 1,000 pork producers, who ship their products to about 100 countries, suffered severe losses after the discovery of H1N1 on Van Ginkel's farm caused countries such as China and the Philippines to ban pork imports from the province, Alberta Pork executive director Paul Hodgman said Sunday.</p>
<p>"The incident on this farm has been devastating for the whole industry," said Hodgman. "But now the herd has been removed, so there's no basis for those border closures to be in place.</p>
<p>"We're glad this incident is behind us now."</p>
<p>In a news release Sunday from Alberta Pork, Van Ginkel said he made the business decision to cull the herd because he couldn't sell the pigs, even though the animals were safe to eat.</p>
<p>A quarantine in place since late April by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency meant no animals from the farm could be marketed until testing showed the virus was gone and all the animals were healthy, the release said.</p>
<p>"I am disappointed that I have to cull these animals, but the presence of the Type A H1N1 virus in my herd left me with few options," said Van Ginkel, who had about 3,000 pigs on his farm near Rocky Mountain House.</p>
<p>"With the quarantine still in place, I was facing another partial cull due to overcrowding and no prospects for marketing my animals once they were given a clean bill of health. The only real option left was to have a complete cull and end the uncertainty for my farm and for the entire pork industry."</p>
<p>Van Ginkel culled the animals under supervision from federal and provincial animal-health experts and animal-welfare officials, Alberta Pork said.</p>
<p>Although not common, Hodgman said it is not unusual for swine producers to cull an entire herd to eradicate diseases so they can start fresh with a new swine herd.</p>
<p>Animal carcasses were disposed of safely in accordance with government requirements, and no meat or pork products from the animals will be used as food for people or other animals, said the release from Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel intends to apply for government assistance to compensate him for his losses.</p>
<p>"We came to Alberta from Holland for a chance to start a new like and this entire event has been extremely stressful for my family. We will now need to start over and build a future for our family," said the father of six children.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel will work with provincial and federal officials over the next few weeks to apply for financial aid through the AgriRecovery and AgriStability programs.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel will ask for money to cover the loss of his animals, the cost of cleaning and disinfecting his operation and the time his business is out of production, said Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>"He has a good case to receive compensation under the program," said Hodgman.</p>
<p>"That's the point of this AgriRecovery program -- for unusual or disastrous interruptions to your business."</p>
<p>Van Ginkel has been a model citizen throughout this ordeal, Hodgman added.</p>
<p>"The poor fellow has been through hell, really. He's done what he was supposed to do under the law. He reported it. It's unfortunate that this happened to him."</p>
<p>Hodgman said it is difficult to estimate how much money Van Ginkel would be entitled to under the financial assistance programs. However, Van Ginkel's lawyer, Keith Wilson, said last month it will cost about $500,000 to compensate Van Ginkel for his losses.</p>
<p>Scientists believe a sick carpenter, who had recently returned from Mexico, might have spread the illness to the animals when he was working in Van Ginkel's barn on April 14. The H1N1 flu virus is transferable between pigs and humans.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, Van Ginkel called a veterinarian when his pigs began coughing and showing symptoms of illness. He said the vet notified the CFIA, and officials appeared on his farm to take blood tests later the same day.</p>
<p>The pigs had been quarantined since April 28.</p>

<p>Manitoba needs to figure out before the fall flu season whether kids should be kept home or schools closed, since children spread flu faster and for longer than anyone else, provincial infectious disease expert Dr. Greg Hammond said Sunday.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 virus struck Mexico, "They closed a number of public facilities. It's something that needs to be thought about for the fall," he said. "We know children are the first wave in a community, and they help spread it around.</p>
<p>"They shed more virus, and for a longer period of time, than do adults," Hammond said. With incubation occurring over one to three days, "If one child infects two or three other children, what you see very rapidly is a lot of children getting sick."</p>
<p>Those children will spread the flu to their parents and other adults, said Hammond, a former senior official in Manitoba Health who now serves as an infectious disease consultant to Health Sciences Centre and the Grace Hospital.</p>
<p>He would not say whether Mountain View School Division should be closing a Dauphin middle school with high absenteeism last week and some students with flu symptoms. However, he said Manitoba needs to think about possible policies before the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Hammond was on a panel Sunday on vaccine development at the opening of Winnipeg's four-day Canadian Public Health Association conference.</p>
<p>He said schools and parents should be alerted whenever absenteeism exceeds 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Sick kids should be kept home, although that is difficult for working parents, he said, and schools must emphasize handwashing and techniques for sneezing and coughing without spreading germs.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu could force the federal and provincial governments to find a way to work together to deal with serious disease outbreaks, said Hammond, chairman of the Manitoba secretariat dedicated to preventing human papillomavirus infections, which can lead to cervical cancer.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 situation will challenge us to do things in a much more streamlined way," Hammond said.</p>
<p>"In Canada, we don't have a single immunization process -- we have 14" for the provinces, territories, and First Nations, he said. "Our provincial boundaries are very arbitrary -- they don't stop infectious diseases."</p>
<p>British studies have shown that closing airports does not control the spread of flu, but closing schools has a significant impact, said Dr. Mark Parrington, head of discovery for the sanofi Pasteur pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Van Exan, founding chairman of the BIOTECanada vaccine industry committee, told the conference that Canada's review process is far more complicated than most other industrialized countries, and that could delay developing an H1N1 vaccine here.</p>
<p>Hammond agreed, but predicted that the reaction to the H1N1 outbreak could break down barriers.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be surprised if we learn through H1N1 that we have to find ways to work together. This will test us all," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Faced with no market for his livestock and overcrowding at his farm, an Alberta farmer has culled his entire herd of 3,000 pigs more than a month after an outbreak of swine flu was detected among his animals.</p>
<p>Arnold Van Ginkel, who farms near Rocky Mountain House in central Alberta, came to Canada six years ago from Holland. He will have to start from scratch once more after his herd was disposed of late last week with the assistance of federal and provincial officials.</p>
<p>“It's a sad situation. It could have happened to anyone,” said Paul Hodgman, executive director of Alberta Pork, which represents producers in the province.</p>
<p>The outbreak – the only case involving the H1N1 flu virus in pigs suspected of having been infected by a human – was detected after a carpenter who had travelled to Mexico did work on the farm.</p>
<p>The farm was placed under quarantine after about 450 animals tested positive for the virus. Some 500 pigs were slaughtered and sent for rendering last month, but the quarantine continued and the disease remained in the herd.</p>
<p>“We came to Alberta from Holland for a chance to start a new life and this entire event has been extremely stressful for my family,” Mr. Van Ginkel, who has applied for government assistance, said in a statement yesterday.</p>
<p>“We will now need to start over and build a future for our family.”</p>
<p>Measures were taken to ensure that no products from the pigs were put into the human or pet food chain, Mr. Hodgman said.</p>
<p>Now that the animals have been slaughtered, Mr. Hodgman said he hopes the ban placed on Alberta Pork by a handful of countries including the major markets of China and the Philippines will be removed.</p>
<p>The discovery of the disease in the herd also led to a drop in prices for Alberta pork, Mr. Hodgman said.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The World Bank is fast running out of funds to lend to poor countries, presenting the richer nations that control the bank with a new demand for cash just as alarms are being sounded at home over the high cost of fighting the financial crisis.</p>
<p>World Bank president Robert Zoellick will be in Ottawa tomorrow, asking Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, Opposition Leader Michael Ignatieff and other legislators to loosen the purse strings as it grapples with an unprecedented demand for aid.</p>
<p>“If the demand for our lending stays at the pace it looks like it is going to be at, it is more likely than not that we will need some sort of increase,” Mr. Zoellick said in a recent interview from Washington.</p>
<p>While the Conservative government has already boosted support for other international development agencies, that was before the cost of rescuing <span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Chrysler LLC</span>, and higher-than-expected employment insurance payments, pushed the budget deficit to record levels. The news of a more than $50-billion shortfall has become a flashpoint for criticism of the government's handling of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>In April, Canada, the United States, Germany and other major stakeholders gave Mr. Zoellick the green light to max out the bank's reserves in order to make loans of up to $100-billion (U.S.) over the next three years. They also asked him to determine whether that would be enough to see the poorest countries through the global recession and report back in October. Mr. Zoellick said he is pretty sure he will be looking for more money.</p>
<p>The Harper government has already committed $200-million (Canadian) to a World Bank fund to back poor countries' exports. Canada has also boosted its stake in the International Monetary Fund, doubled its contribution to the Inter-American Development Bank and pledged another $179-million for the Asian Development Bank.</p>
<p>Stephanie Rubec, a spokeswoman for the federal Finance Department, said Canada and its partners in the Group of 20 economic powers “will continue to review the needs of the institutions in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zoellick acknowledged that it's “a challenge” to get the developed countries to consider the needs of others at the same time their own unemployment rates and debt levels are fast rising.</p>
<p>Demand for World Bank loans over the next year or more appears likely to be “very, very high” because the ripples from the global recession are only now being seriously felt in Africa and other poorer regions, Mr. Zoellick said.</p>
<p>It's too soon to say for sure how much the World Bank might need to prevent infrastructure, health and education programs in Africa, Latin America and other regions from failing, he said.</p>
<p>Conditions are deteriorating for the world's developing countries just as economic indicators in richer countries indicate the worst of the global recession is over.</p>
<p>The financial crisis is unfolding differently in poorer parts of the world. In the United States and Europe, the recession started in the banking sector and spread to the real economy. In developing countries, the collapse of global trade is crushing growth prospects, which is hurting their banks because clients are defaulting on loans.</p>
<p>This situation creates a vicious circle that is exacerbated by the lack of unemployment insurance and social programs in such regions, for example, as sub-Saharan Africa. Poorer countries tend to be more reliant on exporting commodities, so they are dealt a greater blow by declining world demand. Remittances are falling quickly because the workers who went abroad to send money back to their families are losing their jobs and being sent home.</p>
<p>“In sub-Saharan Africa, you have no cushion,” Mr. Zoellick said. “The harsh reality is they will feed the boy before the girl, that if they have some ability to keep someone in school, they will keep the boy and not the girl.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zoellick was complimentary of Canada's efforts, praising Mr. Harper as someone who “knows what he is talking about in economics” and <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> Governor Mark Carney for doing “a very good job in the central banking world.”</p>
<p>In fact, the World Bank chief said he holds Canada up as an example to others.</p>
<p>The bank's trade finance fund to which Canada has already contributed is still short of the G20's goal by about $1.5-billion (U.S.), Mr. Zoellick said. The idea is to raise pledges of about $5-billion to finance trade worth $50-billion over the next three years.</p>
<p>To get others to join, Mr. Zoellick will appeal to their self interest. The trade finance fund will lift demand for the goods Canada and other trading nations produce, giving them potential markets to replace the struggling American consumer.</p>
<p>“We need to build multiple poles of growth,” Mr. Zoellick said. “There is a self interest for economic health.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Road is still bumpy</p>
<p>World Bank president Robert Zoellick isn't ready to call an end to the recession. “There are positive vibrations coming out of financial markets in the near term, but I think there are still large uncertainties in the real economy,” he said.</p>
<p>THE BANKS</p>
<p>Yes, the Obama administration has a program to get the toxic assets off the banks' books. But it's still early. Mr. Zoellick said he is wary of “second- and third-round effects” from exposure to consumer and credit-card debt. Commercial real estate is shaky and markets for securitized debt remain weak, he said.</p>
<p>PROTECTIONISM</p>
<p>As unemployment rises, there's going to be increasing pressure on politicians to curry favour with local companies.</p>
<p>Central and Eastern</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>More than other emerging markets, the former Soviet countries relied on foreign investment and Western European banks to finance their pre-crisis booms. That money is now in retreat.</p>
<p>Private lending in emerging markets</p>
<p>The World Bank estimates that emerging markets are facing a “financing gap” of between $370-billion (U.S.) and $700-billion as risk-averse hedge funds in rich countries and other private lenders invest closer to home.</p>
<p>THE X FACTOR</p>
<p>“The thing that you never see until it hits you,” Mr. Zoellick said, citing the outbreak of swine flu as an example.</p>

<p>Eighteen people were killed in a shootout between drug gangs and soldiers in the Mexican beach resort of Acapulco, the army said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The gun battle, near tourist hotels in the Pacific Ocean resort, was a further blow to Mexico's tourism industry, already reeling from cancellations by foreigners scared away by the swine flu epidemic.</p>
<p>Gunmen battled troops from a cartel safe house, throwing hand grenades at soldiers who had surrounded them and spraying gunfire into military vehicles and nearby homes.</p>
<p>The shooting began late on Saturday and went on until after midnight.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Trips instead of toasters; Destination weddings up 400 per cent</b>
</div><div>Valerie Berenyi   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>731 words</div><div>7 June 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Two of the hottest wedding trends both involve travel.</p>
<p>Brides and grooms looking to cut their wedding costs are flying off to exotic places for so-called destination weddings. And those tying the knot in a more traditional fashion are signing up at honeymoon gift registries, where guests can contribute to a trip instead of a toaster.</p>
<p>"In Canada, destination weddings have quadrupled --they're up 400 per cent since 2001," said Danielle Andrews Sunkel, the Toronto-based president of the Wedding Planners Institute of Canada, which represents 1,200 wedding planners across the country.</p>
<p>"It's another way to save money because you can combine your wedding and your honeymoon --and you'll have a dramatically shortened guest list because not everyone can afford to travel where you're going," said Alison McGill, editor-in-chief of Weddingbells, which is devoting an upcoming issue to the subject of destination weddings.</p>
<p>"It's rare to have more than 30 people at a destination wedding, and lots of places right now are offering amazing packages."</p>
<p>Barry Davis, a travel agent who specializes in wedding packages for Marlin Travel, said the Mayan Riviera in Mexico and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic are the two most popular destinations for Calgary couples.</p>
<p>Mexico's tourism industry was hit hard by the swine flu outbreak, Davis said, and there are now good deals to be had for under $1,000 per person for airfare and a week's stay at a five-star, all-inclusive resort.</p>
<p>Typically though, brides and grooms should budget $2,000 per person, he said. Wedding packages are sometimes thrown in for free or can cost up to $3,000, depending on the level of detail such as flowers, cake, photos, etc.</p>
<p>Lisa Hanslip, owner of The Wedding Planner in Calgary, cautions brides and grooms about off-loading expenses onto their guests' shoulders.</p>
<p>"Doing a destination wedding puts less of a financial burden on the bride and groom, but it costs sometimes as much as 20 times more for your guests to attend," said Hanslip, who used to write a wedding etiquette column for the Herald.</p>
<p>"That's an unfair burden to be putting on your guests in these economic times. At the best of times, you're forcing certain people to relegate their entire vacation allotment to going to your wedding. But brides and grooms should be paying more attention to the fact that times are tough right now."</p>
<p>She said she's had conversations with several 20-somethings who complain they're just starting out in their careers--and don't make much money or get many vacation days --and their friends are jetting off to get married in Hawaii or Mexico to save money.</p>
<p>She also points out that the trend of holding bridal showers or stagettes in places like Las Vegas adds further financial burden for members of the bridal party.</p>
<p>As for honeymoons, there's been a 29 per cent increase in travel being listed on wedding gift registries, according to Weddingbells' annual reader survey, which polled 1,344 readers.</p>
<p>"Most couples--75 per cent--live together before they get married," said McGill.</p>
<p>"They've set up a home together and probably have most of their household essentials so people are gifting experiences instead."</p>
<p>Richelle Mychasiuk and Aaron Saunders, engaged to be married in Calgary on Aug. 15, registered at a local travel agency for their honeymoon. Guests can donate to the couple's trip, a Mediterranean cruise.</p>
<p>"We've been living (together) for three years in a house and we kind of have everything that we need," said Mychasiuk.</p>
<p>Nothing to do with gifts --honeymoon contributions included--should be included on the invitation, said Hanslip.</p>
<p>"People have lost sight of what the registry is for. It's not so you can dictate what people give you; it's to be accommodating to your guests."</p>
<p>That's what your bridal party and your family are for: they can tell people what gifts would be welcome. The modern exception? It's OK to post the information on one's wedding website, Hanslip said.</p>

<p>Big deals at resorts</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted its H1N1 flu-related warning against travel to Mexico, deals to bring tourists back to its beach resorts are burgeoning. Buoyed by the Mexican government's decision to invest $92 million in a "Vive Mexico" tourism campaign, resorts are offering all sorts of great deals. Try these:</p>
<p>n Sandos Hotels & Resorts in Playa del Carmen said it will offer all-inclusive rates starting at $61 per person per night through July 10, a savings of $36 per night.</p>
<p>n Several resorts in Riviera Nayarit announced they would reduce rates by as much as 50 per cent. For example, rates at the Ayia Punta Mita condominium complex will be $250 US per night, including taxes, through Oct. 31 for the best available unit, a savings of as much as $383 a night.</p>

</p>
<p>BAGHDAD -- My underwear strewn across the runway, arms outstretched as an Iraqi official frisks me during my final moments in Baghdad, it was the perfectly bizarre moment to cap the oddest and perhaps saddest weekend of my life.</p>
<p>Even the buff Australian mercenary next to me was beginning to question the heightened security at Iraq's main airport.</p>
<p>"Just what do they expect to find here that the five scanners inside (the airport) didn't pick up?" he wondered aloud.</p>
<p>I was watching another Iraqi rifling through my dirty laundry, thinking, "If you knew what the food had done to my intestines, you wouldn't be doing that."</p>
<p>We had, indeed, been through five sets of luggage scanners to make it to the runway at Baghdad International Airport to catch our flight to Amman, plus five metal detectors and a team of bomb-sniffing dogs.</p>
<p>Getting into the country, by contrast, we had faced only one scanner, one metal detector and a swine-flu test. I have no idea how to make sense of any of that, or much else during my brief visit last month.</p>
<p>This is a country desperate to be seen as returning to normal. But is it? Can it ever? And, after a generation lost to war, isolation and occupation, would the Iraqi people even know "normal" if they saw it?</p>
<p>A trip to Baghdad is one surreal experience after another, almost all of them involving the highly paid private security contractors that have become the enduring symbol of this conflict.</p>
<p>Everywhere are the sad eyes of the Iraqi people themselves, the men looking straight into your own eyes searching for some indication that we believe their claims that things are getting better, when one doubts they believe it themselves.</p>
<p>There was just too much evidence to the contrary, sometimes frightening and sometimes odd, even humorous, to believe than normalcy was anywhere near.</p>
<p>My Baghdad adventure began with a flight from Amman to attend the Iraqi Journalism Summit, an international conference on freedom of the press. Across the aisle sat two British mercenaries. Typically, their hair was short, their T-shirts too tight and their arms unnaturally large.</p>
<p>They were loud, so it was impossible to not listen. Their conversation moved back and forth between two main topics: whether to stay in Iraq or take up an offer to go to Somalia with another private security firm for 250 pounds a day, and Coronation Street.</p>
<p>"Best show ever," one of them said, without a hint of irony, about the long-running British soap.</p>
<p>"Corry," it seems, is not just popular with little old ladies. Soldiers of fortune worry about the travails of David Platt and Rosie Webster, too.</p>
<p>Their biggest challenge, it seemed, was keeping up with the storyline. The show is broadcast around the world, but some countries broadcast it months later than in Britain, while some are only a few weeks behind, making it all too easy to see the shows out of sequence, a real no-no for true fans.</p>
<p>From what I could gather, Amman was more up to date than Bangkok in its episodes. Useless information for me, but it seemed vital to them.</p>
<p>Mercenaries were everywhere in the Iraqi capital. Our hotel was in the city's protected Green Zone but was still guarded by a heavy contingent of soldiers for hire who insisted on inspections and searches whenever we left the compound or returned.</p>
<p>Just getting out of the hotel took at least an hour, sometimes two.</p>
<p>The heavily armed guards followed us everywhere, both in blacked-out SUVs and in pick-up trucks often equipped with anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>When we went for a traditional masgouf dinner on the banks of the Tigris, across the street from the Palestine Hotel, they ringed the restaurant and frisked anyone coming in.</p>
<p>When I needed to go to the washroom, I got an armed escort.</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, our Iraqi hosts boasted that life was returning to normal in Baghdad. Look, they said, we could go to dinner at an outdoor restaurant. We can walk in the park. Shops are open.</p>
<p>They would say these things, grab our arms and stare us straight in the eye - proud men desperate for acknowledgement of the one thing they wanted more than any: a return to a normal life.</p>
<p>Part of me wanted to agree, to believe that life was returning to something approaching normal, and part wanted to shake them out of any such fantasy and tell them just how messed up their country appears to an outsider not used to checkpoints, lockdowns, and armed guards everywhere.</p>
<p>Both options seemed paternalistic.</p>
<p>So we Western reporters attending the conference remained content to allow something in our nods and gestures to be lost in translation, to let them think we might see progress, if that made our hosts happier.</p>
<p>It seemed, at least, the polite thing to do.</p>
<p>After all, it may all just be a matter of perspective, one few Westerners can understand.</p>
<p>I see the shabby houses for the locals, often built from old trailers. My Iraqi hosts see rooftops dotted with satellite dishes that had been banned under Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>I see a restaurant ringed by mercenaries who pat down customers on their way in and escort them to the washroom. They see a restaurant serving traditional grilled fish in the middle of what was, not so long ago, a bloody battlefield.</p>
<p>Who am I to say that's not progress?</p>

</p>
<p>Even in the middle of an economic downturn, Canadians are more concerned about health care than about the economy, according to a survey by a Canadian public affairs research company that is being used as the basis of an interactive web-based survey called the Concern Index.</p>
<p>Health ranked 82 on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of areas of concern, making it No. 1. On the other hand, swine flu was second only to salmon farming as the least pressing concern, suggesting that Canadians are not buying into the global fears over a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>"Health as the number one concern among Canadians is consistent with past surveys we have done," says Dr. Brian Owen, president of NRG Research Group. "But those surveys were conducted before the meltdown of the global economy. So it's surprising that the economy is of secondary concern after health. And even though Canadians' health is the highest concern, there's a low concern over the possibility of a global pandemic."</p>
<p>The telephone survey to a sample of 1,000 people was completed between May 13 and 17. The margin of error is 3.16 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p>

<p>With anywhere, anytime Internet connections the order of the new technological age, Sehmer isn't alone in finding out wireless surfing can come at a staggering cost.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, David Morton was sold on a Rogers Rocket Mobile Internet Stick -- a wireless USB modem that links to the Rogers network and provides wireless data connectivity when you're away from a wired-in or Wi-fi Internet connection.</p>
<p>It's a useful solution for road warriors and other mobile Internet users, but starting at $25 for 500 megabytes of data -- compared to upwards of 60 gigabytes or more on cable or ADSL Internet connections starting at about the same price -- it doesn't add up to an economical deal.</p>
<p>For many users, a combination of the two -- a wired-in Internet solution for home and a USB modem for when they're on the road -- is the best answer.</p>
<p>But some consumers are reading the fine print too late to avoid hefty contract cancellation penalties.</p>
<p>"I went into the Rogers store in Yaletown and had quite a discussion with them,'' Morton said. "It was kind of sold to us as a home Internet solution. They didn't tell us it had limits."</p>
<p>By the time he realized that wasn't the right solution, it was too late.</p>
<p>"My wife used it for just over the one-month trial period and when she took it back they stuck us for the penalty," said Morton.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that talk of megabytes and gigabytes is so much techno-gobbledygook for many consumers. They may have no idea what it translates into when it comes to websurfing, sharing videos, e-mail, downloading movies and music, or the many other functions that have made computers an indispensable tool of daily living.</p>
<p>Nadir Mohamed, the new chief executive at Rogers Communications, said in a recent interview that his company is prepared to address both the needs of early adopters who are heavy data users and of consumers who may be afraid to try new smartphones because they are worried about high bills. His words were backed up by Rogers Wireless's announcement this week of promotional pricing of $30 a month for six gigabytes of data with its new <span class="companylink">Google</span> Android phones. It's the same deal the company offered when it brought Apple's iPhone to Canada last year. However, that pricing is only available for customers who buy one of the two Android-powered phones, the HTC Dream or the HTC Magic. And the offer ends July 1.</p>
<p>Mohamed also said his company is looking at possible changes in data roaming charges.</p>
<p>Gordon Nelson, Rogers vice-president and general manager for B.C., said it is not the company's intent to sell consumers an Internet solution that's not right for their needs. He said the company will consider waiving the contract penalty for customers who mistakenly signed up for the Rogers Rocket mobile service thinking they were getting the equivalent of a no-limits plan.</p>
<p>For most Internet users, home-wired Internet such as cable and ADSL amounts to the equivalent of no limits, since most are well within their plan's cap.</p>
<p>"I would say we would like those individuals to get ahold of Rogers and we will review each individual case," Nelson said of customers like Morton. "It would be our intent to make sure we have customer satisfaction."</p>
<p>Nelson pointed out billing safeguards in his company's plans such as text message warning when a limit is close to being reached, and optional plans that cap bills at $100 during a billing period. According to Rogers, the average usage for the Rocket among its customers is under 500 MB, within the lowest-priced $25 mobile data plan.</p>
<p>But users considering this for their main home connection should remember 500 MB usually suits just one person using the connection, and often for mobile use only. That limit would fall far short of the needs of a family sharing a home Internet connection.</p>
<p>To give you some idea of Internet usage, from mobile and from wired home Internet connections, here is a tally from some of the people on my Twitter network:</p>
<p>• Tris Hussey, a tech blogger, photographer and social media specialist at Vancouver's M2O Productions, tested his Telus mobility wireless USB modem, and in 35 minutes ran up 70 MB of data usage. He wasn't downloading movies or doing any other particularly data heavy tasks: It was web-surfing, receiving e-mail, and instant messaging with Tweetdeck, a Twitter application, open.</p>
<p>• Anthony Floyd, a father of two, said his home use with a Shaw Internet connection averages 17 GB per month, with a low over the past 11 months of 6.1 GB and a high of 55 GB.</p>
<p>• Jon Jennings listens to 5 GB of podcasts auto-downloaded through iTunes every month. Jennings points out downloading a five-minute video amounted to 25 MB.</p>
<p>• Greg Andrews and his two roommates have to watch that they don't blow their monthly Novus cap of 200 GB up/200 GB down. For mobile wireless, Andrews estimates one gigabyte might be good for basic e-mail and web-type use, but add music or video onto that and it's easy to hit.</p>
<p>In Sehmer's case, it wasn't a wireless USB modem that led to bills amounting to more than $100 day at times, but data roaming charges on his iPhone. Wary of roaming charges when he travelled, Sehmer took an unlocked phone to New Zealand and used a local network SIM card there for voice calls.</p>
<p>What he failed to realize was that e-mail landing in his iPhone's in-box was costing hundreds of dollars. He wasn't web-surfing, and estimates he may have used the GPS mapping service on his phone two or three times.</p>
<p>"I had huge wireless data roaming charges," he said. "I wouldn't mind if I had a clue it was going to be like that.</p>
<p>"I did try to find out what the rates were before leaving. Through Rogers' website, I couldn't get any understanding of what the rates would be. There was something about so much per kilobyte downloaded, but one really has no idea what kilobytes are used to check an e-mail."</p>
<p>Sehmer disputed the bill with Rogers, but it was only after the company cut off his service that it relented and agreed to waive all the extra charges from the trip.</p>
<p>"Ironically, they cut me off during the swine flu pandemic, and I'm a doctor," said Sehmer. "They told me I'd have to give a credit card number to get it hooked up again and pay a re-hookup fee."</p>
<p>Roaming charges can add up to astronomical bills. If you have a wireless data plan on your iPhone, BlackBerry or other smartphone, consider turning off the data functionality when you leave the country. Some people have their smartphones set to automatically retrieve data such as e-mail, a costly task if they forget that it's on when they leave home.</p>

<p>HOW MUCH WIRELESS DO YOU NEED?</p>
<p>According to companies such as Telus and Rogers, average USB wireless modem customers go through less than 500 MB per month, but heavy users can easily exceed that amount. Both Telus and Rogers offer mobile Internet sticks starting at 500 MB for $25. Here's what the companies say is normal usage:</p>
<p>- One e-mail, text with no attachments: 4 KB*</p>
<p>- E-mail with small attachment (PowerPoint, Excel sheet): 40 KB</p>
<p>- E-mail with one photo attached: 1 MB (although larger photo formats could be much more)</p>
<p>- Web browsing: 100 KB for average page such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or <span class="companylink">eBay</span></p>
<p>- MP3 download: 4 MB for three-minute song</p>
<p>- Online gaming: 270 KB per minute</p>
<p>- Streaming audio: 1 MB per minute</p>
<p>- Streaming video: 2 MB per minute</p>
<p>* 1,000 KB = 1 MB; 1,000 MB = 1 GB</p>

costing hundreds of dollars.

<div id="hd"><b>29 city schools hit with swine flu; All four boards lack plan to deal with pandemic</b>
</div><div>Mohammed Adam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1127 words</div><div>6 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>As the number of Ottawa schools with suspected H1N1 flu cases doubles to 29, the city's four school boards -- with more than 120,000 students on their rolls -- have no plan of their own to respond to a flu pandemic, the Citizen has learned.</p>
<p>The boards say they will</p>
<p>rely on the city's pandemic plan if disaster strikes, even though that plan specifically asks individual groups and agencies to draw up their own complementary plans.</p>
<p>"Every organization, agency, or group needs to create a pandemic plan that considers the impact of an influenza pandemic on its organization," the city plan says under a section titled "Organization-Specific Pandemic Plans."</p>
<p>Unlike Ottawa, the Toronto District School Board, the largest in the province, has its own detailed blueprint to deal with a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Sherry Nigro, the manager responsible for pandemic planning at Ottawa Public Health, said Friday that "evidence we have today is that 29 schools have been affected by the H1N1 virus since we became aware of it."</p>
<p>That is up from 13 earlier this week.</p>
<p>Nigro also said the virus is now spreading here and officials aren't able to trace it to another infected person, a development British experts, who have noted the trend in their country, say is a sign of an impending pandemic.</p>
<p>To date, at least 37 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus have been discovered in Ottawa. Of that number, 17 have been found among children, including two babies and one child who were hospitalized within the last two weeks.</p>
<p>"We are seeing cases in Ottawa with no specific link to another person. It has been happening in Ontario. That is what we call community spread," Nigro said. "We know that it is fairly transmittable and we know that we are not going to prevent it so what we have to do is minimize it."</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, alluded to the need for continued vigilance in a recent Citizen interview.</p>
<p>"The commonest misperception that I've run into in the last few weeks is the notion that this problem has gone away and we don't have to worry about it, which I think is perhaps more the problem than some of the early concern," he said.</p>
<p>As unease about the flu virus among public health officials grows, Ottawa school boards remain unruffled about their own lack of a pandemic response plan.</p>
<p>The city's plan emphasizes the importance of advance planning so that when disaster strikes, systems in which everyone knows what to do kick into action smoothly. It is why institutions like the Ottawa police, airport authority and hospitals all have emergency response plans.</p>
<p>But the school boards say since they are educators and not health experts, it is better to rely on the expertise of the Ottawa's Public Health Department and the city's pandemic plan. The boards said they've been following the department's advice in telling parents how to cope with the outbreak, and cautioning children to wash their hands.</p>
<p>"Our plan is their plan. Our plan and the Catholic board's and the French public board and (French) Catholic board, all our plans when it comes to issues like this, is what we are directed by the health unit," said Sharlene Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, the largest in the city with more than 72,000 students in 150 schools.</p>
<p>"What they ask us to do is what we do because we feel they are experts in that area."</p>
<p>Mardi de Camp, spokeswoman for the Ottawa Catholic School Board -- with 39,000 students in 80 schools -- agreed, saying she has never seen a separate pandemic plan for school boards. "On all matters having to do with flu-like illnesses in the community, our touchstone is the Ottawa public health," she said. "Our response plan is done in conjunction with Ottawa public health."</p>
<p>However, French public school board spokeswoman Andrée Myette said their crisis prevention and intervention plan has a section that includes guidelines on how to deal with a potential pandemic. The document is now being updated, she said, to bring it in line with the city's plan.</p>
<p>The approach adopted by the Toronto District School Board, which has about 270,000 students, is completely different.</p>
<p>Chris Broadbent, the Toronto board's manager of health and safety, said because its priorities are different from the city's, the board drew up a separate plan to deal with the needs of students and their parents. It lays out in detail what responsibilities school board employees have during a pandemic, who their leaders would be, what parents should expect, and how things like home instruction work.</p>
<p>"Our plan is based on the fact that we are trying to deliver education to students. It is really designed to let our parents know how we will deal with our students in a pandemic, and ensuring continuity of education for the students," Broadbent said. "Our plan dovetails with the city's. There are components that are common, but it is a separate school board plan."</p>
<p>Preparations for a flu pandemic stepped on the national stage Friday as federal Minister of Health Leona Aglukkaq announced $10.8 million in funding over three years for a national influenza research network.</p>
<p>The funds will support the work of 80 scientists from 30 research and public-health institutions across Canada who will test the safety and effectiveness of new vaccines against the H1N1 flu virus, Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>"Thanks to far-sighted investments and lessons learned from the SARS crisis, Canada's research community is well-prepared to deal with this issue," she said during an announcement at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>Led by Dr. Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax, the research network is a partnership between the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, a total of 1,795 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus have been reported in nine provinces and three territories in Canada. Three deaths -- two in Ontario and one in northern Alberta -- have been linked to swine flu.</p>
<p>Funding for the research network comes from a $1-billion commitment in the 2006 federal budget for pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>Globally, 21,940 people are infected with the H1N1 flu virus and 125 have died, according to the World Health Organization. On Friday, the agency's pandemic alert level remained at five, its second-highest level on a scale of one to six.</p>

</p>
<p>Three Hamilton researchers are among 80 joining forces across the country to find ways to protect Canadians from H1N1 flu with $10.8 million in new federal funding.</p>
<p>The money handed out yesterday to fast-track research at 30 institutions, including McMaster University and <span class="companylink">Hamilton Health Sciences</span>, is focused on determining the safety and effectiveness of a pandemic flu vaccine.</p>
<p>"All of us are concerned that this may return in a more severe form and we need to use the next few weeks to months to be ready for that," said Dr. Marek Smieja, a Hamilton microbiologist and infectious diseases physician.</p>
<p>Smieja and his research partner, Dr. Astrid Petrich, are focusing on improving how hospitals diagnose flu because they currently miss up to 25 per cent of cases.</p>
<p>Hamilton's Dr. Mark Loeb, one of Canada's leading infectious disease researchers, will take on a trio of studies including how well a vaccine would protect Canadians, what happens to people when they get infected and how quickly the virus would spread if a health care worker was infected.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 epidemic is evolving and in order to understand it and deal with it effectively we need to have answers," said Loeb.</p>
<p>"The purpose of trying to do this is to try to get answers as rapidly as possible so we can inform public policy on how to deal with the pandemic."</p>
<p>The number of cases of H1N1 in Ontario is nearing 1,100, including seven in Hamilton and 103 in Halton. The virus continues to spread despite June being far outside flu season. So far, most cases have been mild, although three deaths have been linked to swine flu in Canada.</p>
<p>About 4,000 to 8,000 Canadians die of common seasonal flu and its complications annually. There is concern that if H1N1 became more severe during regular flu season in the fall that the death toll could be higher.</p>
<p>The $10.8 million over three years funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Public Health Agency of Canada will create an influenza research network led by Dr. Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre of Vaccinology in Halifax.</p>
<p>"This will link together the sort of work individual hospitals have tried to do," said Smieja. "This will allow us to link together and do it with a much more Canada-wide perspective."</p>

<p>Binoculars point toward North Korea from an observation post in the demilitarized zone at Yeoncheon, South Korea, on Tuesday. Tensions have been high between the two halves of the divided nation since the North conducted its second nuclear test two weeks ago and threatened to attack the South. Local and U.S. forces on the peninsula have been on high alert, and the South has taken the unusual step of joining Americans to search ships for non-conventional weapons.</p>
<p>But as Martin Fackler reported in The New York Times this week, “discipline tours” – team-building field trips organized by South Korean corporations, usually to amusement parks or the mountains – are still coming to the DMZ, even though there have been violent incidents in the 240-kilometre-long zone during critical periods in the past. Buses brought 120 civilians there one recent morning, employees of the Korea Tourism Organization, which operates duty-free shops at an airport near Seoul.</p>
<p>“This is about mental discipline, so they can see this and appreciate all we have now in South Korea,” executive director Kang Joong-Seok said. “We take our wealth for granted.”</p>
<p>The group took a 45-minute hike beside the high barbed-wire fences along the border until they reached the concrete observation platform where they could look across the no man's land to the barricades and pillbox bunkers in the North as well as historic sites from the Korean War.</p>
<p>The president of the company that conducts the tours said he had had 100 people cancel – the duty-free shop workers were the only group visiting this week, and some of them said they had been hoping their tour would be called off as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one 51-year-old tourist who had been a soldier in the DMZ decades ago said, “The thrill is why I came.” He added, “I think all families should bring their children here, to see that our current prosperity is protected by a line of barbed wire.”</p>
<p>“It's like swine flu,” Mr. Kang, the executive director, said about the risky visit. “Some are afraid of this and some aren't. It depends on what you have the stomach for.”</p>

<p>IT is difficult to sort through the divergent stories of provincial and federal officials concerning the public health response to the H1N1 outbreak on Manitoba's First Nations reserves, to piece together the source of the difficulty. It is alarming, however, that Manitoba Health Minister Theresa Oswald asserts her federal counterpart has spurned offers of help, specifically to make available such basic flu-fighting equipment such as masks and anti-viral medication.</p>
<p>It appears that a great deal of talk has gone on among officials, bureaucrats and front-line workers to "prepare" for the deadly pandemic that public health experts have been warning is imminent. The swine flu, so far, has not proven to be virulent and a good thing, too, because the experience at St. Theresa Point, in northern Manitoba, shows that if it were the deadly sort, the virus would have had its way with a relatively small population in a fairly remote place.</p>
<p>There were 21 people from that community in hospital in Winnipeg mid-week, with hundreds more of the 3,000-plus residents registering at the health centre as suffering symptoms of flu. St. Theresa is one of three reserves at Island Lake, not far from Garden Hill and Wasagamack. Conditions on the reserves are much like those in other Manitoba First Nations -- crowded, substandard housing with substandard sewer and water infrastructure that permits the spread of disease with a rapidity unseen in most urban Canadian centres.</p>
<p>These communities are primed to be hotbeds for pandemic alarm. Logically, they should be at the top of the list for a federal-provincial outbreak response. But fully two months after this country was alerted to H1N1, ministers are giving contradictory accounts about the fine details that people will depend upon with their lives. Friday, federal Health Minister Leona Agluggaq insisted there was no hint of any problem in her recent conversation with Ms. Oswald.</p>
<p>Ms. Oswald's most disconcerting assertion was that this province offered repeatedly to make anti-viral medications available to the reserves, but was turned down.</p>
<p>Canadians expect the hundreds of switches in both jurisdictions to flip instantly when emergency hits. The first news of an outbreak at St. Theresa came from doctors there concerned that the public was unaware of a brewing emergency, with official notice following days later.</p>
<p>The exchange between Ms. Oswald and Ms. Agluggaq does not inspire confidence. The first task is to ensure Island Lake residents get necessary care. A clear account of the dispute should be made public when the emergency has passed and a review has been conducted.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Feds vow to start talking - Officials will be available to publicly discuss flu pandemic</b>
</div><div>By Mia Rabson   </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Manitoba Health Minister Theresa Oswald said Friday she has received assurances that federal officials will become more available to communicate with Manitobans about pandemic flu issues.</p>
<p>Oswald spoke with Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq by phone Friday -- a day after Oswald criticized the federal government for poor communication and for refusing help from Manitoba in addressing the H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Oswald said Thursday the province had offered 13 times to help the federal government since May 4 and was consistently told it wasn't needed until Wednesday, when the outbreak of the illness among St. Theresa Point residents became apparent.</p>
<p>More than 20 people from the remote community, 470 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, have been hospitalized in Winnipeg with influenza. Three have been confirmed as having H1N1 influenza. Several hundred more in the community who are showing respiratory symptoms have registered with the nursing station.</p>
<p>Oswald said one of her biggest frustrations was Ottawa's refusal to let local federal health officials participate in news conferences to give information about what was happening.</p>
<p>Manitoba officials do not feel comfortable providing information specific to reserves, said Oswald, but requests to have the federal officials on the ground attend provincial news conferences were consistently denied, she said.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq told Oswald Friday that would no longer happen.</p>
<p>"She agreed we have to do more joint communications," Oswald said. "I am happy with that."</p>
<p>Oswald said she didn't mean to start a "fist fight" with Aglukkaq and said her comments Thursday were not meant to imply the federal health officials in Manitoba were doing a poor job.</p>
<p>"The team on the ground is doing a good job," she said.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, Aglukkaq said she had spoken to Oswald several times since H1N1 arose in late April and that Oswald had never offered any help.</p>
<p>The province quickly countered, saying it wasn't help offered on the ministerial level but by officials on the ground, as established crisis-response procedures dictate.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq's spokeswoman confirmed Friday afternoon the two ministers spoke by phone.</p>
<p>"They are working towards the same goal," she said.</p>
<p>"Our minister is in weekly touch with all of her provincial and territorial counterparts. Departmental officials are in daily touch with the provinces."</p>
<p>Manitoba has jurisdiction for public health for everyone except those living on First Nations communities, which fall under Ottawa's purview.</p>
<p>There are well-established pandemic plans for provinces but extending those plans to First Nations appears to be lagging behind.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Public Health Agency of Canada identified as a problem the lack of agreements between Health Canada and the provinces about who will do what on reserves during a public health crisis.</p>
<p>Four years later those agreements are still being worked on, and while all First Nations are meant to have their own pandemic flu plans, not all of them do.</p>
<p>The Island Lake Tribal Council, of which St. Theresa Point is a member, was in the midst of retooling its plan when this outbreak hit.</p>

<p>Suspect again helps</p>
<p>in search for Tori's body</p>
<p>Murder accused Terri-Lynne McClintic was quietly taken from jail this week to again help investigators search for Victoria "Tori" Stafford's remains.</p>
<p>McClintic spent three days helping officers, said Jeanine LeRoy, McClintic's lawyer. The 19-year-old, who earlier aided in the search for five days, has since been returned to custody, the lawyer said.</p>
<p>A memorial for Tori, 8, is being held today at Woodstock's Calvary Church. The girl went missing April 8 and six weeks later police arrested 28-year-old Michael Rafferty and charged him with first-degree murder. McClintic was originally charged as an accessory but the charge has since been upgraded to first-degree murder.</p>

<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq says the project, which will connect public- and private-sector researchers, will further help protect Canadians from the swine flu.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, there were 1,795 lab-confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu virus reported in Canada.</p>
<p>Toddler found in pond declared dead in hospital</p>
<p>OPP in Owen Sound are investigating the discovery of a toddler in a pond at a home near Shelburne.</p>
<p>The child was taken to hospital in Orangeville where he was pronounced dead. The cause of death is still not known.</p>

<p>Runaways rampant</p>
<p>at group home for teens</p>
<p>Details are emerging about chronic runaway problems at a group home where two 14-year-old boys were sent before they fled to a nearby rural property and, police say, committed a random double murder.</p>
<p>A consultant's report written for the province in 2007 found that 245 troubled teens walked away from the home in a rural area east of Edmonton over a five-year period starting in 2001. That was the worst record of any Alberta group home, says a government official.</p>
<p>One teen has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder. The other is charged with being an accessory after the fact.</p>

<p>Man, 39, charged</p>
<p>for shooting at Mountie</p>
<p>A 39-year-old man is facing a charge of attempted murder after an RCMP officer in Pond Inlet was shot at several times.</p>
<p>Police say the Mountie was driving a marked vehicle when it was fired at with a rifle. The officer was not hurt and took cover as several more shots were fired from a house. The man then barricaded himself inside the home for nine hours, threatening to kill the RCMP officer.</p>

<p>Medical marijuana user charged with trafficking</p>
<p>Yvan Ferland, who has a permit from Health Canada allowing him to cultivate marijuana for therapeutic purposes, was in court yesterday, facing drug-trafficking charges after police found 45 kilograms of the drug at his St-Norbert home in 2007.</p>
<p>Ferland, 50, admitted surpassing the five-kilo limit of the drug he was allowed, but said he followed recommendations by Health Canada to conserve everything he didn't consume and turn it into compost. He says the excess material seized by police was nonconsumable waste - notably branches and twigs from the plants - and destined for his compost pile.</p>
<p>The former bush pilot told jurors that cannabis was the only remedy to alleviate the back pain he's suffered since a crash in 2001. He often burst into tears as he testified yesterday.</p>

</p>
<p>Wearing a bow tie and black tuxedo, Dr. James Young stood beaming at the foot of the grand staircase at Queen's Park. It was the evening of Sept. 20, 2005, and Young was receiving the province's highest honour, the Order of Ontario.</p>
<p>The night marked the pinnacle of an illustrious career in public service that spanned 23 years and included a long list of impressive appointments.</p>
<p>"Dr. James Young has had to do tasks over the years that others may find gruesome. But as Ontario's former chief coroner and commissioner of emergency management, it goes with the job," said Joan Andrew, the Order's secretary general.</p>
<p>She spoke of how Young had ably co-managed the SARS crisis, and how he had helped identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York, the Swissair plane crash off Nova Scotia, the Asian tsunami and the Bali terrorist bombings.</p>
<p>On this night, Young's star was at its brightest. He was lauded as Canada's man on the scene of some of the worst disasters in modern history.</p>
<p>But Young's life was about to change. In November 2005, a major review began of the work of a rogue pathologist, who, for years, had been under Young's watch. The probe would eventually reveal that Dr. Charles Smith had made mistakes in performing autopsies and erred in investigations into the deaths of 20 children. In some cases, parents and caregivers were wrongfully prosecuted and siblings of dead children were put up for adoption.</p>
<p>While much has been written about Smith's involvement in these tragic miscarriages of justice, far less attention has been paid to Young, his de facto supervisor. A look back at the career of Young, now 60, shows that while he was flying the globe as Canada's point man on disaster management, no one was minding the store.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an overhauled Coroners Act was given royal assent to ensure such tragedies never happen again.</p>
<p>The legislation, which for the first time holds the province's chief coroner accountable to an oversight council, coincides with Young's resignation as a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, effective this past Monday, meaning he can no longer practise medicine in the province. Nevertheless, the college is continuing to investigate Young over his role in the Smith fiasco.</p>
<p>Ultimately, his downfall serves as a cautionary tale in failed accountability. A public inquiry into pediatric forensic pathology, which ended last year, found Smith lacked expertise in forensic pathology. But it also found that Young and his deputy, Dr. Jim Cairns, were blind to Smith's inadequacies partly because they also lacked specialized training in forensic pathology.</p>
<p>Young and Cairns played a role in building Smith's reputation as the most eminent pediatric forensic pathologist in Ontario. Smith's stature reflected well on the coroner's office, the inquiry found. The office actively protected Smith from critics who had identified his shortcomings as many as 17 years earlier.</p>
<p>As Young accepted extra responsibilities in government, the office of the chief coroner suffered. Instead of considering whether the coroner's office had played a role in wrongful convictions, Young was more concerned about the adverse publicity that Smith might attract, according to the inquiry.</p>
<p>"Dr. Young was the last to see the writing on the wall," wrote the inquiry commissioner, Justice Stephen Goudge, in his final report in October. "With the additional burdens imposed by his new responsibilities, Dr. Young's inattention to day-to-day administration was a recipe for a failure of oversight."</p>
<p>Problems with oversight and accountability were compounded by misconceptions about Young's expertise, with even his political bosses assuming he had more credentials than he did.</p>
<p>In the end, the Smith saga not only shattered public confidence in pediatric forensic pathology, but seriously compromised Ontario's criminal justice system. The casualties included William Mullins-Johnson, 38, who spent 12 years in jail after being wrongly convicted of the first-degree murder of his 4-year-old niece. Other appeals are underway and the province is looking at compensation for the victims, which could leave taxpayers on the hook for millions.</p>
<p>Young declined to be interviewed for this story, but in an email he wrote that he didn't realize he had done anything wrong: "With the benefit of hindsight, I would have made some decisions differently, but at the time I believed I was doing what was right."</p>
<p>He added: "The inquiry has provided valuable lessons for individuals and institutions. While I may not agree with some aspects of the Commission's report, debating these differences will not in my view advance the cause of building a better system for the future."</p>
<p>In August 2003, Young was snoozing in the backyard of his cottage near Barrie, taking full advantage of his first days off in months, after the SARS crisis. So he was none too pleased when the office called about a power outage.</p>
<p>"It's sunny up here and I really don't care," he told the caller.</p>
<p>"You do care."</p>
<p>"No, I don't."</p>
<p>When told the whole province was without power, he quickly arranged for an OPP helicopter to pick him up, fetch then-premier Ernie Eves in Caledon, then head to Toronto.</p>
<p>During an eight-day state of emergency, Young was at his best: in command, at the eye of the storm, and front and centre in the media. Young was always ready and willing to take charge and politicians loved him for it.</p>
<p>His reputation grew with each disaster.</p>
<p>The previous year he had become Ontario's commissioner of public safety and was the province's front man in the post-9/11 war on terrorism. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Young participated in daily news conferences to update the public on measures to contain the virus. He liked the media and the media liked him; he was friendly, accessible and delivered good sound bites. "We got better ratings than The Edge of Night," he said in a speech years later. "We became folk stars in our own area."</p>
<p>Young's stellar reputation was partly built on misconceptions. Liberal MPP Monte Kwinter, who served as community safety minister from 2003 to 2007, believed Young performed autopsies (a procedure performed only by pathologists). He revealed this when explaining how, as a minister, he could not technically evaluate Young's work.</p>
<p>"How am I supposed to know if he's doing a good job or not?" said Kwinter. "Am I supposed to go in and say, 'Are you sure you dissected that guy properly?' What do I know?"</p>
<p>Former federal health minister Pierre Pettigrew said he chose to dispatch Young to the Asian region devastated by a tsunami in 2004 because "he's one of the top pathologists in Canada." (Pettigrew later explained he didn't have any records before him when he made the comment and his memory was a little hazy.)</p>
<p>Sometimes the media got it wrong, referring to Young as a pathologist and an expert in DNA analysis. So did government news releases. The one announcing his Order of Ontario appointment referred to him as "one of Canada's foremost forensic scientists."</p>
<p>Young's reputation grew, as did his curriculum vitae.</p>
<p>During the inquiry, a section of his resume, titled "Papers Presented," came under scrutiny. It listed studies presented at American conferences on which Young is named as an author, along with Smith and others. But when questioned, Young revealed he had not authored or presented a number of these papers.</p>
<p>"My name is last because that's where it deserves to be," Young said. "I wasn't writing the paper or generating the research or presenting the paper ... It's a way of sort of being able to say ... this is the body of research that the office is doing right now."</p>
<p>Dr. John Butt, a forensic pathologist who testified at the inquiry about Smith's errors, raises more questions about Young's bio, particularly the details of his involvement in the 1998 Swissair jet recovery. Butt was Nova Scotia's medical examiner at the time of the crash and his office called Young for help.</p>
<p>What caught Butt's attention was an excerpt of Young's c.v. that he says "exaggerated" Young's role, particularly the claim that he "coordinated" certain tasks.</p>
<p>"He had no unique sectors that he was in charge of," says Butt, now a Vancouver-based forensic consultant. He agrees that Young provided "expert support and guidance," but says identifying victims took more than a year and Young was there for less than a month.</p>
<p>Butt says that Young was by his side much of the time and was a valuable sounding board and an able troubleshooter. "I'll tell you what his forte is. He's a good leader and he's got a quick mind."</p>
<p>In 2005, a year after James Young lost the chief coroner's job over a potential conflict with his role as commissioner of emergency management, the whistle was blown on Charles Smith. Dr. Barry McLellan, the new chief coroner, forced Smith to resign as director of Ontario's pediatric forensic pathology unit. He had wanted to do this earlier but was vetoed by Young.</p>
<p>McLellan initiated a review of Smith's work, which led to the Goudge Inquiry.</p>
<p>Sitting in the witness box, Young fumbled as he apologized for his role in the debacle: "I ... it ... it distresses me tremendously to think that during my watch and during my time that these things happened ... and it ... it ... I really do apologize for the miscarriages of justice."</p>
<p>Young admitted he should have done more: "I don't know why we didn't stop (Smith) doing everything at that time ... I just don't know."</p>
<p>Lawyer Julian Falconer struck a nerve, arguing that accountability was eroded because of Young's "professional ambition" to take on more positions in government.</p>
<p>Young said historical events demand strong leaders: "There are times for certain kinds of leaders in certain places in history. At the time that I was chief coroner and doing the other work, I made a conscious decision to agree with the government to do the other work."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most damning evidence heard at the inquiry was that Young had ignored warning signals about Smith. In early 1991, Justice Patrick Dunn acquitted a Timmins girl who had been charged with manslaughter at age 12 in the death of a toddler she had been babysitting. Dunn determined that Smith, the Crown's star witness, lacked objectivity, failed to thoroughly investigate the case, neglected to keep proper records and lacked familiarity with relevant scientific literature.</p>
<p>Young testified he had only learned of the Dunn decision shortly before the inquiry started and was "dumbfounded" by it. But he had numerous opportunities to learn of it earlier: from a college investigator in 1997, although Young disputes this; from a 1999 complaint about a botched death investigation; on the CBC's Fifth Estate, also in 1999; and in 2001, in a Maclean's magazine feature.</p>
<p>As complaints mounted from coroners, police, Crown counsel and the public, Young and his deputy, Cairns, failed to rein in Smith. In 1997, the college wanted to investigate a complaint about Smith, but Young argued the regulatory body had no jurisdiction over the coroner's office.</p>
<p>In 2000, Young announced his office would review Smith's cases to assess his competence, but the idea was later dropped quietly. In 2001, Young asked Smith to stop doing coroners' cases, not because he was worried about his competence, but because of the negative attention the pathologist might attract.</p>
<p>In April 2002, Young sent a letter to the college, defending Smith against complaints about his ethics and judgment. The letter had been written by Smith's lawyers and Young sent it, virtually unaltered. "The letter was not balanced or objective or candid. It was not a letter worthy of a senior public office-holder in Ontario," Goudge said.</p>
<p>Young made many valuable contributions to the province, but his track record has been tarnished by this debacle.</p>
<p>"I'd hate to see there be a sense that all the ills that led to miscarriages of justice rest on his shoulders, because I think that would be unfair," says Lorne Sossin, a law professor at the University of Toronto who conducted research for the inquiry, authoring a paper on oversight.</p>
<p>Many other factors contributed to the miscarriages, including an outdated Coroners Act, a shortage of forensic pathologists, inadequate quality control measures, organizational weaknesses, insufficient action by Cairns (who also declined to be interviewed for this article) and a "think dirty" culture in cases of children's deaths.</p>
<p>"I think the moral coming out of this is that no matter what systems you have in place, personality and individual judgment are ultimately going to be what oversight rises or falls on," Sossin says.</p>
<p>In 2005, Young was squeezed out of the Ontario bureaucracy, according to government sources, to make way for Julian Fantino, a potential Tory candidate. In turn, the Liberal government helped Young land a job in Ottawa as special adviser to the deputy minister of public safety and emergency preparedness. Young wasn't happy about the move, sources say.</p>
<p>He left Ottawa - and the public service - at the end of 2007.</p>
<p>Young, in his email, said he devoted much of his life to public service with the best of intentions:</p>
<p>"I entered public service more than 25 years ago because I believed that coroners' work could improve the country and the province I love ... Throughout my career I always acted in good faith and did what I thought was best for the people of Ontario and Canada."</p>
<p>Young has moved from his Toronto condo to his cottage and does consultant work on pandemic preparedness. Although once a leading Canadian authority on the subject, he has been notably absent from the public arena during the current swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>For the time being, Young says, he is taking a break from public service.</p>
<p>"Whether this is temporary or permanent remains to be seen."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Massey absentee numbers hit 200</b>

</p>
<p>About 200 children were absent from Regina's Massey School on Friday, while another one of the elementary school's students tested postive for H1N1.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region confirmed a second Massey student was officially diagnosed with the H1N1 influenza virus, also known as swine flu.</p>
<p>After he confirmed the first case on Thursday, deputy medical health officer Dr. Maurice Hennink said many of the absent Massey students are likely infected.</p>
<p>Hennink noted that some students won't be tested, meaning that the confirmed numbers do not provide an accurate measure of the extent of the illness' spread.</p>
<p>On Friday, Ross Brown, deputy director of instruction and school services for the Regina Public School Division, said the absentee rate at Massey -- which has just fewer than 450 students -- had risen to 200.</p>
<p>Some parents simply said their child would not be attending school, while others indicated their child was experiencing flu-like symptoms and would be out for seven days, as has been recommended by authorities.</p>
<p>"This increase was expected, as we have asked parents to keep students at home if they are feeling ill," Brown said. "We anticipate that this trend will reverse itself over the next week or two as students begin returning to school."</p>
<p>Brown emphasized all public schools are staying open -- including Massey.</p>
<p>"The advice of the health region has been very clear," he said. "It is a mild form of the flu ... and there's no real need to close the schools.</p>
<p>"We feel this is probably the best for the community, for the schools to remain open and for students to have access to their education."</p>
<p>There hasn't been any "notable increase" in absenteeism at any of the other schools in the division, he added.</p>
<p>"At all schools, we will continue to sanitize high-contact areas throughout the buildings. At Massey, we will also do a thorough disinfectant cleaning of all desk surfaces this weekend," he stated.</p>
<p>Substitutes have replaced some of the 38 staff members at Massey, he said, but would not confirm how many, citing privacy rules about personnel information.</p>
<p>Sandra Baragar, superintendent of student services for the Regina Catholic School Division, said it's business as usual for schools in the separate system.</p>
<p>"Right now we are looking at all of our schools, obviously, and monitoring both staff and student attendance," she said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Right now, we're not seeing anything different than normal. Of course we are monitoring it daily, and we're trying to do our best to ensure that everybody stays safe and healthy."</p>
<p>One Catholic elementary school saw slightly higher absentee rates related to illness back in early May -- but numbers throughout the division have "normalized" since, according to Baragar.</p>
<p>Local sports associations whose seasons are now in full swing indicate that their operations have not been affected.</p>
<p>Hugh McLaughlan, president of Baseball Regina, said he hadn't heard of any games being cancelled because of a lack of players or any similar phenomenon.</p>
<p>"So far I haven't heard a thing," he said. "I think that parents for the most part are wise enough to keep their kids at home, particularly when it comes to sports -- if they're not feeling well, they're not going to perform very well."</p>
<p>In an e-mail, Dennis Morse, executive director of the Regina Soccer Association, said that there haven't been any reports of children who play on teams within the organization calling in sick.</p>
<p>"We have not had any information filter up about absenteeism or the like."</p>
<p>Kev Sumner of the Saskatchewan Soccer Association said his organization plans to provide member districts with information from the provincial health office.</p>
<p>Parents are advised to keep their children home if they are sick, and to encourage all players to follow "common-sense rules" like avoiding sharing water bottles and high fives, he said.</p>
<p>The total number of officially confirmed H1N1 cases in the province rose to 179 on Friday, with 42 of those in the Regina area.</p>

</p>
<p>More than half a dozen Edmonton schools, including one private school, have sent letters home to parents in the past month notifying them that a case of the H1N1 influenza virus has been diagnosed in their child's school.</p>
<p>Edmonton Public Schools spokesman Cory Sinclair said public schools have been notified of 16 confirmed cases of the swine flu, since the first student diagnosis in the district on May 14.</p>
<p>Cases have since been reported at six schools, including three elementary, one K-9 school and two high schools.</p>
<p>Edmonton Catholic school spokeswoman Lori Nagy said there have been a "handful of cases" in schools.</p>
<p>"As standard practice, we have our custodians doing a thorough clean and disinfection of the school once we have an H1N1 case," Nagy said.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, there were 145 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus in Alberta, with 69 of those in the Edmonton area. There has been one death in Alberta connected to the virus.</p>
<p>While the virus and heightened global concern about a serious pandemic initially prompted Edmonton school officials to impose travel restrictions as the number of cases started to mount worldwide, those bans were lifted after several days.</p>
<p>Signs continue to be posted in public schools, however, warning people not to enter if they have flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"Because of the severity being relatively mild for the most part, we're a lot less concerned than we were in April," Sinclair said.</p>

<p>A remote First Nation in northern Manitoba has confirmed two cases of swine flu, but says that more than 100 people have reported being ill in recent days. Chief David McDougall of St. Theresa Point spoke to reporters on Thursday at an emergency news conference.</p>
<p>About 20 residents of the community have recently been flown to Winnipeg hospital suffering with flu-like symptoms, including 11 people who were airlifted in the last week.</p>
<p>"Those are all pending confirmation if they are in fact infected by this (swine flu) virus," the chief said.</p>
<p>McDougall urged understanding for his fly-in community of 3,200 people, saying that there have been more confirmed cases in Winnipeg than in St. Theresa Point.</p>

<p>The Manitoba government had offered the federal government help with pandemic planning on First Nations 13 times since May 4, but was turned down every time until Wednesday -- the day it was revealed that 12 residents of a remote northern reserve had been hospitalized with flu symptoms. Health Minister Theresa Oswald made the revelation Thursday as she expressed frustration at the federal government's response to the H1N1 flu outbreak when it comes to First Nations like St. Theresa Point, saying the province has been prevented from doing more because it doesn't have jurisdiction.</p>

<p>A Winnipeg hotel has reportedly asked guests to leave because of fears they have H1N1.</p>
<p>The residents of St. Theresa Point First Nation were in Winnipeg for health checkups unrelated to influenza but were asked to leave the hotel, said the community's chief, David McDougall.</p>
<p>"It's a little disappointing having to put up with that," he said in an interview Thursday night.</p>
<p>"We have enough problems on our hands," said the chief, whose remote community is facing an influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>Officials at the hotel would not comment last night.</p>
<p>At least two residents of St. Theresa Point have been infected with the same strain of H1N1 influenza that caused a panic last month after a number of cases popped up in Mexico. There are currently 21 community residents with severe flu-like symptoms being treated in Winnipeg hospitals, McDougall said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dr. Elise Weiss, Manitoba's acting chief medical officer, said the total number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Manitoba now stands at 40.</p>
<p>At a news conference, McDougall said he understood people are alarmed, but to "stigmatize" St. Theresa Point residents is an overreaction.</p>
<p>"There have been two known (H1N1 influenza) cases in my community -- confirmed cases -- but according to the public health report there are 27 cases within the city of Winnipeg. So I can't see proportionally why there's a big alarm for dealing with people from St. Theresa Point," he said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald said the province's medical experts have protocols on infection control, including isolating individuals, where appropriate, and these experts are the best judges of how to keep the public safe.</p>
<p>"Dr. (Joel) Kettner (Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer) has said repeatedly H1N1 is here. It's in a lot of communities and so we all need to be taking the same precautions and not discriminating against or isolating and unduly honing in on one specific group or one specific community... "</p>
<p>Robert Flett, the director of health for the Island Lake Tribal Council -- which includes St. Theresa Point -- said all three schools in the region had been closed as a precaution, affecting approximately 2,500 students. McDougall said some residents of St. Theresa Point have also begun wearing masks, and are trying to avoid congregating to avoid spreading the virus.</p>
<p>Former MP and MLA Elijah Harper, blames Third World living conditions on poverty-stricken reserves for leaving aboriginal people sitting ducks for pandemic flu outbreaks. He said many people at St. Theresa Point -- and other aboriginal reserves in the area -- are susceptible to illnesses because they live without running water and electricity in their homes.</p>
<p>Pat Jacob, general manager of the North West Company's Northern Stores in Manitoba, said the flu has forced the store in St. Theresa Point to cut its hours because of the number of staff not coming in.</p>
<p>RCMP spokeswoman Sgt. Line Karpish said the force has issued protective equipment to its members in St. Theresa Point, including masks, gloves and hand sanitizer they can take with them.</p>

<p>Just like many other Greater Victorians, I caught a bug recently and am sick this week.</p>
<p>I doubt it's the infamous "swine flu," seeing as any number of more common colds and flus are hanging around out there right now.</p>
<p>But for a moment let's pretend that it is, if only for the purposes of demonstrating that there isn't a sniff of hope in these modern times for containing the spread of new viruses.</p>
<p>The new H1N1 flu is contagious 24 hours before you show any symptoms and for at least seven days after you get sick, as are all flu viruses. That means I was contagious as of last Saturday.</p>
<p>That was the day I was shopping in Seattle with my daughter and stepdaughter. We were jammed into the basement of Nordstrom Rack with at least a thousand other women over the course of the afternoon. I can't imagine how many articles of clothing I handled that day -- how many hangers I jostled, changing-room doors I pushed open, people I brushed up against while engaging in the intense contact sport of discount shopping.</p>
<p>That night, I went to a packed restaurant full of Saturday-night revellers and beautiful young people in prom clothes, out celebrating their high-school grad. I hugged a friend from Seattle who had joined us for dinner, and we all shared an appetizer that involved us breaking off pieces of flatbread and dipping it in a single dish of melted cheese. I spent the night in a very small hotel room with my daughters, both of whom were already sick with some cold-like illness.</p>
<p>On Sunday, my stepdaughter flew back home to England, taking whatever bug she had -- and perhaps mine, too -- onto two planes, through three airports and aboard a train to Exeter.</p>
<p>My other daughter and I spent the morning weaving through throngs of tourists and locals packed into Pike Place Market, then went on to more discount shopping at the bustling outlet mall near the <span class="companylink">Tulalip Casino</span>.</p>
<p>My credit card passed from me to a store clerk and back again any number of times over the weekend. I shared pens, passed along my passport at the border, handled a whole lot of merchandise in a whole lot of stores. I took a busy B.C. Ferry back to Victoria on Sunday night.</p>
<p>You get the picture: I shared public space with large numbers of people before I even knew I was sick. I know now, of course, which should mean I'll take steps to avoid infecting anyone from this point on.</p>
<p>But here we stumble into another unworkable theory for flu management: That people will stay home for seven days after the onset of symptoms to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Are there people who can just close up their lives for seven days due to possibly having the flu? I know I can't.</p>
<p>For one thing, I'm self-employed, which means no paid sick time. But even when I did have that fringe benefit, there was no way I would have stayed home for seven days straight just because I thought I had the flu. The truth is that people work through sickness all the time, and the modern workplace depends on it.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I work at home, sans co-workers. But I've got two contracts hitting deadlines over the next two weeks, and they require me to get out there and meet with people, flu or no flu. My plan: A couple of Dayquils when needed and onward into my regular life, albeit with a bit more attention to handwashing and avoiding close spaces.</p>
<p>The flu experts want me to wear a mask if I have to go out in public. Maybe I'd consider that if knew absolutely that I had some virulent flu strain and not just a garden-variety cold.</p>
<p>But therein lies the other difficult aspect of controlling the spread of influenza: How often do any of us actually know that we even have a confirmed case of the flu? It's my opinion that I've had the flu many times in my lifetime, but I've never gone for a blood test to confirm any of it. Health officials anticipate confirming as few as five per cent of the H1N1 cases currently spreading around the world.</p>
<p>A pandemic strategy is a good thing, of course, and I'm glad for all the stockpiled Tamiflu and scientists working away on new vaccines.</p>
<p>But best practice and human habits are leagues apart when it comes to spreading the flu. Eat your veggies and hope for the best, because avoiding each other simply isn't an option.</p>

<p>U.S. health officials have confirmed 20 deaths from the new strain of H1N1 flu, with more than 11,000 confirmed or probable cases. Three U.S. deaths were reported on Wednesday -- two in New York and one in Connecticut. Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 11,054 confirmed and probable cases.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Farmers ready and willing to discuss food production</b>

</p>
<p>We have attempted to tell our story for years -- but for the most part, people haven't been interested in food and farming. After all, from the average Canadian's perspective, there was safe food and plenty of it, so what else was there to know?</p>
<p>But that was in the days before food scares, a misnamed influenza virus, and an increasing environmental awareness shifted the spotlight increasingly on to agriculture and food producers.</p>
<p>All of a sudden we're seeing an increase in questions about our food. Where does it come from? How is it produced? Who grows it? How is it processed? How does it get to our stores and to our tables?</p>
<p>These questions spring from many sources -- issues such as the recent H1N1 influenza outbreak that was mistakenly attributed to pigs and pork, as well as food-borne illness caused by E.coli, or Ontario's newly implemented pesticide ban.</p>
<p>But this new interest in food production is also influenced by incidents outside of our borders -- such as tainted food products, food recalls, and production practices no longer deemed acceptable here at home. Due to the global marketplace, a host of different countries are now supplying many of the food products now found on Canadian store shelves.</p>
<p>A newly released Harris/Decima poll about Canadian eating habits backs up what I've been hearing from farmers and following in the media -- Canadians care about their food and they want to know more about it. According to the Real Food Survey, which polled more than 2,200 Canadians, 86 per cent prefer to eat locally sourced foods. And 71 per cent of respondents indicated they read labels and packages to learn more about their food and where it comes from.</p>
<p>So, that raises the obvious question: Where can Canadians go to get those answers? After all, less than two per cent of Canada's population is involved in farming and most are several generations removed from the farm.</p>
<p>A new virtual farm tour project spearheaded by AGCare, a Guelph-based farm organization, may help. Four farm tours depicting real Ontario fruit, vegetable, grain and flower farms are being produced for a website called www.farmissues.com[http://www.farmissues.com]. It already hosts 17 different farm tours dedicated to livestock and poultry farming that receive close to two million hits per year.</p>
<p>At the site, visitors can click on various parts of an aerial farm photograph to view close up, panoramic views of the fields or barns and to meet the farmers who live and work there. Once inside the barns or other buildings, pop-up screens explain what's happening and answer commonly asked questions about farming.</p>
<p>Much like the online home tours used by real estate agents, the farm tours will let consumers learn about food and farming and farmers can demonstrate and explain what they do without having to invite visitors onto their farms.</p>
<p>Filming for the project is underway and the tours are expected to be ready for release next winter.</p>
<p>Another way to learn more about our food is to connect with farmers directly -- at their on-farm markets, their roadside stands and the booths at farmers' markets. They'll be more than happy to talk to you about what they do and the care they put into the animals they raise and the crops they grow.</p>
<p>Farmers live where they work and often also eat what they produce, so they have a strong interest and a vested stake in making sure they're protecting the environment and growing healthy food.</p>
<p>For example, more than 70 per cent of Ontario's farmers have completed the Environmental Farm Plan, and they've invested about $120 million over the last four years in making on-farm environmental improvements. They've also voluntarily reduced their pesticide use by more than 50 per cent in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>There are many good news stories like these in Canadian agriculture that we should all be proud of. Farmers are ready to tell those stories. And Canadians, it seems, are ready and eager to listen.</p>

</p>
<p>The number of cases of the new swine flu virus in Canada has jumped 17 per cent in the past two days.</p>
<p>It's largely due to a 25 per cent increase in reported cases in Ontario.</p>
<p>The total number of cases in Canada as of yesterday stands at 1,795.</p>
<p>Since Monday 179 new cases have been reported in Ontario, pushing the province's total to 894.</p>
<p>It's the second time in as many weeks that Ontario has reported a big spike in cases -- last Friday it reported 131 new ones.</p>
<p>Quebec has the second largest number of cases at 346 - up 37 since Monday.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG paramedics are worried gaps in the province's pandemic plan may have exposed two Winnipeg paramedics to the virus while they transported patients from St. Theresa Point to hospital.</p>
<p>Tim Scharer, vice-president of the Professional Paramedic Association of Winnipeg, said paramedics weren't alerted last Friday that they were transporting patients who may have swine flu when an air ambulance arrived from St. Theresa Point.</p>
<p>Paramedics are supposed to wear masks and gowns when transporting suspected cases of swine flu, and clean the ambulance after they deliver the patient. Scharer said hospital staff alerted the paramedics they may have been exposed to the virus, and the ambulance was cleaned before new patients were picked up. He said the communication breakdown between the nursing station, air ambulance and city paramedics needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>At least one paramedic has been tested for swine flu, but lab results are unavailable.</p>

<p>Phil Nevin, taken first overall in the 1992 major-league baseball draft ahead of Derek Jeter, knows all about the pressure and expectation of playing pro ball. It doesn't relent much when you coach.</p>
<p>That sound you might have heard from Royal</p>
<p>Athletic Park last night was the frustration continuing as Nevin's Orange County Flyers lost their ninth Golden Baseball League game in as many outings.</p>
<p>Headed the other way, the Victoria Seals (4-8) won their third straight victory with a 3-1 win before 1,812 appreciative fans at Royal Athletic Park.</p>
<p>The game ended dramatically with the bases loaded for Orange County in the top of the ninth inning before Victoria reliever Mike Reeves got out of the potentially nasty jam.</p>
<p>Nevin knows it is a learning process in the minor pros and he enjoys the teaching side of things.</p>
<p>"The most gratifying situation as a coach would be to be sitting on my couch in a couple of years and watching one of my players in the big leagues," said Nevin, a 12-season major leaguer.</p>
<p>"But most of all, it's the relationships and stories of pro baseball that these players will carry forward with them and be able to tell their kids about. It's these stories the players will remember down the line."</p>
<p>Orange County started Adam Johnson, the second overall selection in the 2000 major-league draft. Johnson, who played nine games with the Minnesota Twins, went five and two-third innings, giving up two runs, six hits with one strikeout and five walks.</p>
<p>Former Padres' prospect Isaac Hess, the inspiring story of the GBL season after being told he would never pitch following after hip surgery as a teen, took the win for Victoria and pitched a strong game with a shutout through six and two-third innings with just three hits and seven base runners allowed. He also racked up eight strikeouts.</p>
<p>"We got a late start to the season because we were set to play Tijuana to open," said Nevin, of the Potros team, which had to drop out of the GBL because of the swine flu situatuion in Mexico.</p>
<p>"It's been a learning process so far and it's early. But there are no excuses. We're still going to be a good team in this league before we're done."</p>
<p>Brian Rios led the Victoria offence with a club-record five hits and a run in a five-for-five night. The question as the evening wore on, however, was whether the Seals would be haunted by the 11 men left on base over the first seven innings including two bases-loaded situations.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of getting comfortable with each other," said Rios, of Victoria's recent turnaround.</p>
<p>The defensive play of the game was a shoe-top diving catch by Victoria second baseman Pedro Montero that saved a run in the seventh inning.</p>
<p>DIAMOND DUST: The Seals will host a Businessman's Nooner special -- otherwise known as Hooky Heaven -- with a weekday afternoon game at noon today at Royal Athletic to close out the three-game set against Orange County. The Seals are then on the road for six games, beginning tomorrow at Chico, Calif., with three against the Outlaws followed by three games in Fullerton, Calif., against Orange County before returning home to meet the Calgary Vipers on June 12 . . . Seals coach Dan DiPace was the fifth Victoria coach or player who was a member of Hall of Famer Gary Carter's 2008 GBL champion Orange County team. DiPace, Victoria field boss Darrell Evans and Seals players Josh Arhart, Brian Rios and Ezequiel Ruvalcaba will receive their GBL championship rings in a pre-game ceremony on Tuesday when the Seals open a three-game set against the Flyers in Fullerton. DiPace's name was omitted in an earlier story . . . "It was bound to happen sooner or later," chuckled the Seals' Internet play-by-play announcer Mike Walker, after correcting himself after calling the Seals the Salmon Kings.</p>

</p>
<p>A group of University of Regina students slated to leave next week for a study tour in China have been grounded over flu fears.</p>
<p>Concerns about the potential spread of the new H1N1 flu strain from some of the Chinese universities expected to host the group resulted in the cancellation of the two-week trip, leaving students scrambling to make up course credits elsewhere this summer.</p>
<p>"It's sad," said Mariel Harvey, 27, who is studying international development.</p>
<p>"It would have been a really exciting opportunity," said Harvey, who added she wanted to thank the professors who had helped spearhead the now-defunct study tour.</p>
<p>The course was dubbed "Northwest China: Legacies of the Silk Road," and billed as an opportunity for students to observe, experience and study in China's northwest region and look at issues such as rapid urbanization and environmental degradation. Six graduate students and 10 undergraduate students had signed up to leave June 9.</p>
<p>"I think most of the host universities there are thinking that visitors from North America maybe would be better served if everything was postponed until the concerns settle down," said Barb Pollock, vice-president of external relations for the U of R. "We're one of other universities we understand in North America who aren't going over."</p>
<p>Pollock said alternate arrangements are being made for students to take other courses.</p>
<p>"I'm sure many, if not all, are disappointed."</p>
<p>Another trip by the university president and some senior administrators to China was also put off due to that country's flu concerns, Pollock said.</p>
<p>But Pollock said she sees the disruptions as "simply a hiccup and we hope that we'll pick up where we were leaving off."</p>
<p>Harvey said while the flu issue seems overblown in the media, she in some ways understands why China is taking such a cautious approach.</p>
<p>"I was in Asia when the SARS crisis hit, and I think China got a lot of harsh criticism," she said.</p>
<p>She and a couple other students still plan to go to Ulsan, South Korea this July as part of their University of Regina studies.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has confirmed 153 cases of the H1N1 flu, a strain that has sometimes been referred to as swine flu. Most cases have been mild, an experience reflected across Canada. Health officials say they continue to monitor the situation to see if the strain changes into something that causes more severe illness, or becomes part of the seasonal flu mix.</p>

<p>Marco DeLuca pinches a delicate purple-sprouting broccoli stem between his fingers and pulls it off, along with a wide green leaf.</p>
<p>"You can just throw it in stir-fries, stuff like that," he says as he navigates the three pine garden boxes he built in his backyard.</p>
<p>The boxes contain the fruits (or vegetables) of DeLuca's labour -- lettuce, radishes, endive, fennel and more.</p>
<p>It's his first time planting his own garden and DeLuca, 31, is hooked.</p>
<p>"Seeds are cheap and you can go and spend $20 and get lots of different stuff," he says. "It's like having a grocery store in your backyard."</p>
<p>DeLuca is not alone. This year, gardens have sprung up across Vancouver at street corners and even on apartment balconies, which means that seed sales are on the rise -- big time.</p>
<p>"It's shocking. I mean, I'm doing seed orders once a week, which is more than we've ever done," says Laura Doheny, manager at David Hunter Garden Centers on West Broadway, who stocks at least 100 varieties of seed. "Our racks have been continually empty."</p>
<p>The reasons, says Doheny, are both new and old: In economically unstable times, gardening makes financial sense, but it's also an environmental issue that's been gaining prominence for years.</p>
<p>"People are just really interested in having the opportunity to try to grow their own food," she says, adding that the younger generation has also gotten into planting as well.</p>
<p>"Food prices are really high right now, especially vegetables and fruits."</p>
<p>At Delta's West Coast Seeds, owner Jeanette McCall says that demand for her small company's organic seeds is up 40 per cent from last year.</p>
<p>"It's been big for everybody," says McCall. "Not just us, but for all the seed companies."</p>
<p>The appeal of planting your own seeds is wide-ranging, says Karen Wristen, executive director of the Society Promoting Environmental Conservation (SPEC) in Kitsilano.</p>
<p>"You can grow varieties of food that you can't buy in the store, that are way more tasty and appealing than the things that are commercially produced," she says.</p>
<p>"The flavour of a pea that has just been picked, and warmed in butter, is incomparable."</p>
<p>DeLuca agrees that his own plants taste better. But he adds that recent events, such as the economic meltdown and swine flu, have made people more aware of the importance of local, safe food.</p>
<p>"Our lifestyle isn't as secure as you think," he says. "If people stop to think about what's important to them, food and water are at the top of the list."</p>
