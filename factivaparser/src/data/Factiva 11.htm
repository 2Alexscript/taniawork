</div><div>Theresa Boyle    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>532 words</div><div>11 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>Public health officials are misleading Canadians by continuing to characterize the H1N1 virus as a threat in the hopes of unloading millions of doses of unused vaccine, charges Ontario's former chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>They are trying to save face because of an expensive overreaction, Dr. Richard Schabas said Thursday as lineups for the vaccine continued to dwindle.</p>
<p>He made his comments the day after the Public Health Agency of Canada unveiled a new advertising campaign aimed at encouraging Canadians to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Spending Christmas in bed or in an ICU unit is no fun and the only way to actually avoid that is for a large number of Canadians to be immunized," agency head Dr. David Butler-Jones told a teleconference.</p>
<p>He also said discussions are underway with the World Health Organization on what to do with the surplus vaccine.</p>
<p>Schabas, who is medical officer of health for Hastings and Prince Edward Counties, estimates that 35 million of the 50.4 million doses of vaccine that Canada has ordered, at a cost of more than $400 million, will not be used.</p>
<p>"They bought 50 million doses of vaccine and it's an embarrassment to them that it's not being used," he said, adding that it became available too late.</p>
<p>"I think if you are going to make that push, you at least need to tell people that the outbreak is essentially over and you have to say to people any future risk of H1N1, at least this year, is extremely small. ... You shouldn't mislead people." Schabas said.</p>
<p>The number of Canadians visiting doctors with flu-like symptoms peaked in late October, he noted.</p>
<p>"The real story is the disconnect between what the senior public health officials, provincially and nationally, have been saying to people and what's actually been going on," Schabas argued. "They have been misrepresenting the state of the outbreak and the level of risk."</p>
<p>Schabas said health officials have been preparing for years for a deadly avian flu pandemic and have had trouble switching gears to respond the mild H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>He added, people aren't buying into the fear as is evidenced by closing flu clinics. Toronto's eight remaining clinics were all to close Sunday but three of them shut their doors earlier this week because of little traffic.</p>
<p>While government officials now acknowledge the pandemic has turned out to be not as bad as initially feared, Schabas said they have been slow to adjust their responses.</p>
<p>"I think they got their knickers in a knot because they responded to their preconceptions. There was a preconception that a pandemic was going to be a terrible event," he said.</p>
<p>Ontario's 600-plus-page pandemic plan, like pandemic plans around the world, is modelled on a "moderately severe" pandemic with assumptions based on the 1957 flu pandemic. It anticipated 13,000 could die and up to 54,000 could require hospitalization.</p>
<p>The latest provincial numbers show 104 H1N1-related deaths and 1,656 hospitalizations so far.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Playground politicians; When we exercise our parenting veto rights our daughters launch a grassroots campaign – and call us mean</b>

</p>
<p>Like so many middle-aged parents, my husband and I invite input from our two school-aged children on family decisions such as how to spend Christmas vacation or whether a swimming pool belongs in our suburban backyard.</p>
<p>At mealtimes we huddle like football players, strategizing on everything from dog obedience to household chores. In doing so we join a large fraternity of modern parents who take pride in the different way we are raising our offspring.</p>
<p>We tell ourselves we are increasing our children's problem-solving skills. We are encouraging our kids to make contributions, set goals and take responsibility. The payoff for us is the enjoyment of more peaceful relationships with our two daughters. That is until we must exercise what we have come to term our parenting veto rights. This is when the boundary between parent and child is indelibly drawn. This is also when our efforts to be democratic often come back to bite us in the proverbial backside.</p>
<p>Although we agree in principle with many of today's popular democratic parenting philosophies, we feel that some decisions are beyond the reach of an eight- or 11-year-old. Often these are the tough calls about whether or not our children can safely and appropriately engage in a given event or activity. This could stem from a sudden change in their physical health to questions over their skill level or age-appropriateness.</p>
<p>So when the return to public school left us vulnerable to the H1N1 virus, we decided that sleepovers with friends would be temporarily suspended, at least until the chronic cough and perpetually runny nose we had all developed cleared up.</p>
<p>Until now these decisions had been made on a case-by-case basis, limited only if the girls had an early-morning swim lesson or dance class. But as most parents of school-aged children know, sleepovers are junk-food-fuelled play dates that often extend into the wee hours of the morning. The next day we brace for the impacts of our sleep-deprived children and their sugar-withdrawal episodes.</p>
<p>We realize our decision to temporarily suspend all sleepovers was not in accordance with official public-health policy. This made it all the more heinous to our daughters. We have come to expect that just about any decision to limit our children's activities will be met with a well-executed rebuttal from one or both of them.</p>
<p>This typically includes an ad hoc public-opinion poll conducted at recess or lunch that reveals a staggering number of friends and fellow classmates had already been granted approval by their parents. As news of our actions passes from the monkey bars to the soccer pitch, we open ourselves up to the inevitable comparisons with all those other parents. An official opposition begins to form as our kids attempt to recruit a grassroots campaign from the oppressed masses of their playground public.</p>
<p>Despite whatever risk factors we have identified, my husband and I are painfully aware that when we play the parenting veto card, our popularity in the house plummets. We know that we risk losing our reputation as the hip, cool, supportive, much-adored modern parents we know ourselves to be.</p>
<p>Our children protest like disgruntled constituents in the face of a failed election promise. They cry injustice. They whine, they badger, they plead. Worst of all, they tell us we are “mean.” Still, we tell ourselves that some decisions are simply outside the purview of people who still wipe their noses on their sleeves and expect that their lost teeth will turn magically into cash beneath their sleeping heads.</p>
<p>In our more vulnerable moments, when we fall prey to the doe-eyed expressions of our youngest daughter, or are badgered by our smarter-than-average sixth grader, we tell ourselves to be strong. We remind ourselves there are times in every young parent's life when we must endure the fallout of unpopular but necessary decisions.</p>
<p>This is an uncomfortable time in our household. Our family makes the painful transition from a democracy to what is popularly termed a benign dictatorship. This is when, as parents, we most closely identify with NHL referees who develop an impenetrable hide to stave off the criticisms of a disapproving hockey public. In the case of our kids, we're hoping to develop something akin to beluga whale blubber.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our children are not yet at an age where they can hold a grudge for longer than a few hours. Once they are teenagers, this is likely to change. We hold out hope that by exercising these veto powers now, we are building up our immunity to such consequences. And maybe, just maybe, we can maintain some semblance of influence over our children's lives. At least enough to see them through to their 18th birthdays.</p>

<p>THE city's mass immunization clinics will wrap up on Saturday, but it doesn't mean that H1N1 has gone away.</p>
<p>In the past week, a Manitoba senior with no underlying medical conditions died of the flu virus, bringing the provincial death toll this fall to three.</p>
<p>As well, three more patients in Manitoba were admitted to intensive care units with H1N1. And with Christmas coming, many Manitobans will be exposed to those who might be infected with the virus, said Dr. Joel Kettner, the province's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"We've got to take this very seriously," Kettner said Thursday. "It ain't over. This ain't over."</p>
<p>During the week of Dec. 1-7, 87 more Manitobans tested positive for H1N1, brining the total since Oct. 6 to 1,697.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, nearly 420,000 Manitobans had received the H1N1 shot -- or about 35 per cent of the province's population.</p>
<p>As of Monday, Winnipeggers will be able to receive either the H1N1 and seasonal flu shot at community-based clinics. Anyone who wants to book an appointment to be vaccinated can call 788-8004 Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Vaccine is also available at some family doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Kettner said he's not disappointed that only one-third of Manitobans have been vaccinated so far, particularly since vaccine supplies were tight earlier on and lineups at mass clinics were long. He expects many Manitobans will step forward to be immunized now that there are more options.</p>

<p>Swine flu infected 50 million people in the U.S. and killed an estimated 10,000 through Nov. 14 from the start of the pandemic in April, said Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>About 1,100 of those who died were children, Frieden said Thursday. That compares with fewer than 90 pediatric deaths reported in each of the past two flu seasons, according to the CDC. In a typical season, 36,000 people die of the regular flu in the U.S.</p>

<p>Are your readers aware that those requiring the H1N1 vaccine may be able to get an injection from their pharmacist?</p>
<p>Many pharmacists around B.C. were given injection training this year for this very purpose.</p>
<p>I own the Crest Pharmasave on 10th Ave in Burnaby and myself and my two pharmacists can all give the vaccinations. So far we've done almost 500 of them.</p>
<p>The best part is that you can make an appointment or even just drop in and usually we have no more than a five-minute wait.</p>
<p>Your readers should check with their local pharmacists to see if they can get the H1N1 vaccine there, and leave going to the doctor's office for the truly sick.</p>

<p>Last week Health Minister Kevin Falcon said that B.C. has enough H1N1 vaccine doses for every man, woman and child in the province. That sounds like good news -- but not for everyone.</p>
<p>The health authorities had enough staff to attend senior care complexes and give residents the seasonal flu shot. But apparently they won't be doing the same for the H1N1 vaccine, and that is extremely unfortunate.</p>
<p>Our seniors' residence has about 100 residents, the average age is 85 and everyone has a health problem. But several who have physical disabilities are unable to attend a clinic set up for flu shots.</p>
<p>Once again, our government has short-changed our seniors.</p>
<p>It would be a travesty if just one senior were to die from the swine flu when there was enough vaccine but no provision to use it.</p>

<p>Having again gone through the stress of coming up with ideal gifts for fortunate loved ones who pretty much have everything they could want, Trisha Fast's family decided last year to adopt a "pay it forward" challenge this Christmas as their gift to each other.</p>
<p>Trisha and her husband, her two sisters and their spouses, and her parents each "adopted" a charity and are recruiting friends and family to the cause to see who can generate the highest spirit of giving this Christmas.</p>
<p>"We all are starting with $300, which we would have otherwise spent on needless gifts to each other. Our challenge is to roll that into more by donations of others," Trisha wrote.</p>
<p>"There are so many that have none to give; therefore, they do not get. We are able to help them and it truly does feel great to give to those who need it."</p>
<p>The Fasts, who adopted the Saskatoon Crisis Nursery, contacted the agency to get a list of items it needs and are hosting a gathering this weekend to see how much they can collect to help out.</p>
<p>One of Trisha's sisters is helping to ship items to the Philippines to help her housekeeper's family affected by recent natural disasters there, while a sister who lives outside Saskatoon is helping out a couple of less fortunate families in her town.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trisha's parents are donating to the Chris Knox Foundation. That agency provides children and young adults who are fighting cancer, in remission or in palliative care an opportunity to attend sporting, fine arts or other cultural events. The goal is to provide them with a reprieve from their challenges and create some happy memories with families and loved ones.</p>
<p>Looks to me like these good folks have chosen a stress-free, fun and much-appreciated alternative to gift giving that more of us might find attractive as we elbow our way through the throngs of shoppers at stores these days.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>If you, too, are considering adopting a worthwhile cause this season, you might want to consider SWITCH -- the student wellness initiative toward community health -- that's doing some great work on Saskatoon's west side.</p>
<p>The project, which has become a Canadian model for a student-managed health-care project since it began operating in 2005, has post-secondary student volunteers from a variety of disciplines working under the guidance of mentors to provide clinical, social and health promotion services for clients.</p>
<p>For instance, a $10 donation buys the fruits and vegetables served for clients on one shift, $30 buys a turkey for the Thanksgiving or Christmas community dinner, $50 purchases program supplies for one women's drop-in night community kitchen and $100 will pay for one mentor for one shift.</p>
<p>You can make a donation online at: www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=d89680[http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=d89680].</p>

<p>You don't have to be a hockey parent to imagine the reaction Sheri Smith and her nine-year-old son Andrew had on a recent weekend when they went out to their car to grab his goalie gear for a tournament in Biggar, only to discover all of it had been stolen overnight.</p>
<p>In a hurry and in bit of a panic, they headed to Al Anderson's Source for Sports, where they've done business before and have been impressed with the customer service.</p>
<p>"We picked up a bag and just filled it with stuff," is how Sheri described the hurried expedition, but they couldn't find the goalie pads Andrew prefers.</p>
<p>Staff member Chris spent time talking to Andrew to see what was needed, she said, and the store ended up lending her son a set of pads to tide him over for the day. They made it to Biggar, where Andrew tended two games and his team won the B final.</p>
<p>"It meant a lot to get those pads," says Sheri, who feels the store went above and beyond regular customer service to make sure they were helped out of a tight corner.</p>
<p>She appreciates how respectfully Chris dealt with her young son, and noted that even on previous visits she's noticed there's "no effort to up-sell" customers.</p>
<p>"We've gone in before thinking of new skates and after an hour of trying on skates, left with only laces."</p>
<p>She offers the store and Chris kudos for the "amazing service."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Emma Campbell greatly appreciated the fine efforts of volunteers and health region staff who are running the H1N1 vaccination clinic at Prairieland Park.</p>
<p>Caring guides make sure the thousands of people who come for their shots get to the right areas, Campbell wrote, while other volunteers provide further instructions and information.</p>
<p>"After receiving our shots, we sat for 15 minutes under close surveillance to see if there was a reaction to the serum. Upon leaving, again there were caregivers watching over us until we left the building.</p>
<p>"All are to be commended for their great work to the public. You all were very courteous, kind and helpful."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mass immunizations to end; H1N1 shot to be given at health offices; vaccination rate 41% in region so far</b>
</div><div>Jeanette Stewart   </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix, with Saskatchewan News Network files</div>
<div>744 words</div><div>11 December 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>After providing more than 55,000 people with the stick and poke, the mass immunization clinic at Prairieland Park will close its doors next week.</p>
<p>The clinic closes Thursday, Dec. 17, at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The facility was set up five weeks ago to dispense mass H1N1 immunizations to the Saskatoon public, with 30 nurses able to deliver 4,000 immunizations per day.</p>
<p>Overall, 41 per cent of the Saskatoon Health Region's population, or 122,000 residents, have received an H1N1 vaccination. The number of people seeking an immunization is declining, say health region officials.</p>
<p>"One of the reasons we moved (to Prairieland) is we knew our local health offices couldn't accommodate the waiting period to immunize," said Karen Grauer, manager of disease control for public health. "Now we feel that those offices, with appointments, could accommodate it."</p>
<p>Statistics show less than 40 per cent of those in the 15-55 age demographic received the vaccine, with those in the 20- to 29-year-old age range at the lowest rate of vaccination, at 24 per cent.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of health-care workers received the vaccine and 71 per cent of children up to nine years of age received the shot. Some 58 per cent of children in the 10 to 14 age group received the shot and 50 per cent of people age 55 and older received a vaccine.</p>
<p>Those who have waited to get the vaccine are encouraged to take advantage of the public clinic before it closes, even if they think they have already been infected with H1N1.</p>
<p>"The vaccine is very safe and has performed very well at the community level. There is no reason not to get it," said Dr. Johnmark Opondo, deputy medical officer with the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>The Prairieland Park clinic is open weekdays from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Rural mass immunization clinics will also close Dec. 17.</p>
<p>"If we're up to 50 per cent at the end of this or slightly above it, we'll be well protected," said Dr. Ross Findlater, deputy medical health officer with the health region.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 18, those wanting the H1N1 vaccine or parents with children needing their second dose of the vaccine can make an appointment by calling 655-4358. High-risk individuals are encouraged to go to Prairieland Park before the clinic closes, as vaccines will only be available by appointment.</p>
<p>Once a vial of vaccine is opened it must be used within 24 hours. Each vial contains 10 adult doses, which requires careful co-ordination of appointments.</p>
<p>Officials at the health region do not yet know how much the Prairieland clinic cost. Facility rentals, supplies and overtime hours are among the costs that will be tallied, said region spokesperson Linda Walker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saskatchewan is head and shoulders above many provinces in the number of residents who have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Half of the province's residents have received the H1N1 shot and Dr. Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer, predicts that will rise to at least 60 per cent by year's end.</p>
<p>"We're amongst the highest in Canada so I'm very pleased with the results," she said at a news conference Thursday. "Demand has fallen off as we expected, but it's still steady."</p>
<p>All residents in some northern Saskatchewan communities were vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Overall, the vaccination rate in the North is 85 per cent and I think that's really paid dividends," said McKinnon, who added there have been no recent medical evacuations and very little illness in the North.</p>
<p>However, she reported two more H1N1-associated deaths in Saskatchewan: A man and a woman who were over 50 and had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>That brings the number of H1N1-linked deaths in the province to 14.</p>

<p>Employment agency charged for taking fees from foreigners</p>
<p>An employment agency has been charged with collecting thousands of dollars in fees to place foreign workers in fast-food jobs in Calgary. J.F. Garcia Manpower Services, owned by Jose Garcia, is alleged to have charged two workers from the Philippines $6,000 each to find them jobs at fast-food outlets in 2007. He faces two counts of charging workers illegal fees and two counts of operating an employment agency without a provincial licence. Garcia is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Jan. 28 in Calgary.</p>

<p>A moose appears to be at the centre of a nasty chain of accidents in eastern Newfoundland and Labrador. Police say a truck and moose collided Tuesday evening on the Trans-Canada Highway near Holyrood, damaging the vehicle but not injuring the driver. As the police began clearing the scene and directing traffic, another vehicle was seen speeding out of control toward the accident site. The vehicle struck the rear section of the truck, became airborne and rolled twice before landing on the police vehicle. The 28-year-old male driver was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>

Shelley Melanson, who helped lead the noisy protest, says the group was hand-delivering about 90,000 postcards signed by students and community members. She says the government must lower tuition fees and stop the huge debts that students are accumulating in order to get an education.</p>

<p>It appears the rise in H1N1 deaths in Canada is slowing. The latest figures from the Public Health Agency of Canada show six new deaths reported in the six-day period that ended Tuesday, occurring in British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec and Newfoundland. By comparison, the agency had reported 28 deaths in the previous period. The national total of laboratory confirmed H1N1 deaths is now 363. The most recent report from the World Health Organization suggests at least 8,768 people around the globe have died from the disease. The death estimates reflect laboratory confirmed deaths, which experts say are likely to be an underestimate of the total toll of the disease.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>We can't abandon farmers to economic insecurity</b>
</div><div>Lilian Schaer   </div>
<div>660 words</div><div>10 December 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>It's been about a year since we were plunged into financial crisis and economic uncertainty. In response, governments in many countries, including Canada, went to unprecedented lengths to protect jobs, stimulate growth and reassure nervous citizens.</p>
<p>Here at home, signs of recovery are emerging. We see the economic action plan at work in our communities and every one of us is now a proud part owner of an automaker.</p>
<p>But there's one sector that still desperately needs support - one that is just as important and just as significant as cars, roads or bridges. And that's agriculture.</p>
<p>For the people who grow our food, the economic crisis isn't one that just started a year ago. In some sectors, like horticulture, beef or pork, it's been part of a longer downturn that has been affecting their businesses for several years.</p>
<p>When BSE (more widely known as mad cow disease) hit Canada in 2003 and borders were shut to our exports of beef, veal and sheep, farmers suffered heavy losses, followed by rising feed costs and a soaring Canadian currency. The pork industry has most recently been hit by a popular misnomer for the H1N1 influenza that impacted the global pork trade, but it, too, have long been affected by high feed costs and a high Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>In horticulture, prices for fruits and vegetables are dictated by the lowest cost product available on the world market. When Canadian farmers attempt to recover their increased production costs by raising prices, their product is no longer competitive and retailers turn to lower priced imports. And for all farmers, regardless of what they raise or grow, the cost of fuel, fertilizers, crop protection and other materials have risen at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>The solution to boosting long term sustainability that farm leaders are now proposing is cost of production insurance to protect farmers from escalating costs and decreased returns. The program would be based on farmer-paid premiums that trigger payments to farmers only when market prices fall below a pre-determined industry price. This would help ensure stable farm incomes and alleviate the seemingly never-ending need for government support programs.</p>
<p>Now some people will ask an obvious question – why should farmers get a support program to help stabilize their incomes? After all, there are many small and medium-sized businesses in Canada who face difficulties making ends meet and no one is lining up to promote an income insurance program for them.</p>
<p>True enough, but it's far from as simple as that. There is the over-arching question of food security and food sovereignty to consider.</p>
<p>Yes, perhaps others can produce our food more cheaply for us than we can produce it ourselves, but is that really what we want or need? We already spend less on food than almost any other developed nation in the world. As an independent country, we should put some priority on ensuring the safety of our entire food supply- not just the food we produce ourselves - and maintain some level of self-sufficiency when it comes to supplying our food needs.</p>
<p>And then there's the economic impact. Agriculture has long been second only to Ontario's automotive sector in terms of contribution to the provincial economy and, some would argue, it has possibly moved to the number one spot within the last year.</p>
<p>But ultimately, agriculture is about food. And food is not only about health and nutrition, but also about culture, identity, family and friends How many nations link their cultural identity directly to their culinary traditions? It doesn't get much more fundamental than that, and as consumers and as Canadians we should support whatever it takes to protect that legacy for our future generations.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pork industry undergoing image remake</b>
</div><div>John Cotter   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>398 words</div><div>10 December 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>

<p>EDMONTON</p>
<p>As Canada's hog industry teeters on the brink of collapse, producer Herman Simons is thinking about his children and trying to be optimistic about the coming year.</p>
<p>Simons moved to Canada from Holland 21 years ago with only two suitcases and a dream of owning his own hog farm. Working hard and encouraged by governments to expand, Simons saw his operation near Tees, Alta., flourish as he and other Canadian producers put pork on dinner tables around the world.</p>
<p>But over the last three years thousands of hog farmers have been driven out of the industry by low prices, high production costs, protectionist U.S. trade rules and, more recently, by the effect of H1N1 on pork markets.</p>
<p>Simons and other producers who have toughed it out aren't making money but are determined to come up with a strategy that will allow their once thriving industry to bounce back. Or at least survive.</p>
<p>"We have to crawl out of the hole and there will still be a few months of losses," said Simons, who is chair of Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>"China has reopened its market - that is positive - and the prices are slowly creeping up, although not fast enough for a lot of producers. We have to do things differently."</p>
<p>Producer groups such as the Canadian Pork Council and Alberta Pork are trying to restructure the industry so it can compete in the face of a strong Canadian dollar and high feed costs.</p>
<p>But competing on price alone is no longer an option, they say. The long-term plan involves transforming the country's pork from a mere commodity into a recognizable brand.</p>
<p>The idea is to showcase the high quality of grain-fed Canadian pork, which is firmer, less fatty, has a better texture and is produced under better health safety rules than pork in other countries. The hope is that consumers will pay more for a better product.</p>
<p>Such an image remake takes time. The challenge is to ensure that pig farmers survive in the shorter term.</p>
<p>In 1986, there were more than 36,400 hog producers in Canada. By the end of this year, that number will be down to about 7,000. Most of the remaining producers are running larger farms, but even the big operators are going out of business.</p>

<p>I would like to commend the outstanding work done by the medics and paramedics in the West Island as a part of the ongoing H1N1 vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>They have shown remarkable efficiency in carrying out this surprisingly complex process, as well as admirable dedication to the well-being of people in our local community.</p>
<p>On behalf of the residents in my riding, I would like to thank each of the people involved for their hard work.</p>

<p>- - I started taking ginkgo to improve my memory, but I keep forgetting to buy more when it runs out.</p>
<p>- - Is there a bylaw that prohibits the repaving of 63rd Avenue from 99th Street to Gateway Boulevard? The local auto dealerships must use that stretch to simulate off -road driving.</p>
<p>- - If ever there is an example of the need for a better way to get across the river, this week was it. Traffic was stop-and-go from 6:30 a.m. until noon on Saskatchewan Drive and down the hill to the Walterdale Bridge.</p>
<p>- - I like the proposed Expo 2017 bridge that would replace the Walterdale Bridge. I just want to know why we have to spend $2.3 billion on a world's fair to get it.</p>
<p>- - I don't care how much a PETA membership costs. Sign me up, now.</p>
<p>- - I noticed that even going off the road in a cloud of snow was not enough to make the drivers on the QE2 hang up their damned cell-phones.</p>
<p>- - What good is plowing the major roads if I can't get out of my crescent?</p>
<p>- - How can emergency or DATS vehicles make it through snow-covered side streets? It's not fair for wheelchair-bound people to be stuck in their houses because the city won't plow their roads.</p>
<p>- - Please don't shovel the snow from your driveway out onto the road. The city isn't going to plow the street and the ruts are deep enough without your contribution.</p>
<p>- - During Friday's snowstorm, I saw three cars spinning out while trying to get up a hill, and a dozen or so people getting out to help push. Edmontonians rock.</p>
<p>- - Even in times of soul-crushingly extreme snowfall, one must keep one's priorities in mind and shovel a path to the barbecue.</p>
<p>- - Memo to city council: Instead of pumping money into the Indy, save it for snow removal.</p>
<p>- - How embarrassing. The city throws away millions on a car race, yet gives the libraries a hard time about wanting more money.</p>
<p>- - Something is definitely wrong when art galleries, arenas and money-losing sports events are more important than the police service.</p>
<p>- - When hard-working bus drivers need safety shields, you know Edmonton is not a safe place to live anymore.</p>
<p>- - I now hold six part-time and seasonal jobs, none with benefits or guaranteed hours. I guess the reason I have a mortgage and a home is because I'm willing to work with what I've got.</p>
<p>- - I really wish the billions that would be spent on transmission lines would be funnelled into household solar panels and small wind turbines instead. This would be greener energy and produce more jobs.</p>
<p>- - If we're suffering from a shortage of doctors, how does raising the fees for medical school help?</p>
<p>- - A simple message to Alberta Health Services and the Alberta government: The core of health care is health care, not administration and not politics.</p>
<p>- - It's hardly surprising that attempts by some Canadian retailers to bring U.S.-style "Black Friday" sales to this country have fallen flat. From even a minimally intelligent consumer perspective, the effort reeked of gimmick-laden opportunism at best.</p>
<p>- - This sad little story about Tiger Woods shows the media at its absolute worst.</p>
<p>- - It would certainly seem the travails of Tiger Woods have become more newsworthy than the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>- - There is no such thing as privacy anymore, so why the astonishment/ outrage/bewilderment when one's personal life is put on display for everyone to cluck over?</p>
<p>- - I wonder if Tiger Woods realizes now that it takes a lifetime to earn respect and only a moment to lose it.</p>
<p>- - The sign at the cashier's counter said, "Express." Three women were in front of me. The first waited until her order was completely bagged before she started to hunt for her wallet. The second was oblivious to the world while on her cellphone. The third was buying enough groceries to feed a football team.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Charest more defensive of French in B.C. than Montreal; Francophones are worried by the level of French in downtown stores</b>
</div><div>DON MACPHERSON   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>676 words</div><div>10 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Unlike Keith Spicer, his predecessor as federal commissioner of official languages who coined the expression "Westmount Rhodesians," former Gazette journalist Graham Fraser would rather err on the side of understatement than hyperbole.</p>
<p>So when Fraser expressed "skepticism" this week about promises to provide services in French for the Vancouver Winter Olympics, it was as if someone less moderate in word as well as opinion had thrown a chair in an outburst of exasperation.</p>
<p>Appearing before the Commons committee on official languages on Tuesday, Fraser referred repeatedly to "assurances" he had received, but he had yet to see plans for implementing many of them. And with little over two months left until the Games, he could only hope that the promises would be kept.</p>
<p>But "shortfalls" already observed had left the commissioner "skeptical as to whether the entire Olympic organization has developed a linguistic duality reflex."</p>
<p>The lack of such a reflex isn't surprising, in a province far from Quebec where fewer people have French as their mother tongue than Chinese languages, Punjabi, or even German. At the 2006 census, only 15,325 British Columbians spoke French most often at home.</p>
<p>So it's difficult to recruit French-speaking staff for the Games locally. And there has been some local criticism of federal spending on services in French for the Games as "pandering" to Quebec.</p>
<p>Still, French is an official language of the Olympics as well as of the host country, so French-speaking participants and spectators who travel to the Games will feel entitled to a certain level of service in their language.</p>
<p>Complaints have already appeared in the Quebec media. And last week, after meeting with his B.C. counterpart when the Olympic torch run passed through Quebec City, Premier Jean Charest said the availability of services in French at the Games "is a real preoccupation for Quebec."</p>
<p>Charest's comments, which were reported in the B.C. press, might be resented there as hypocritical meddling on the part of another province that is unilingual in law though not in fact.</p>
<p>But in this province, as Charest said, the availability of service in French at the Games "is a sensitive issue." And complaints about a lack of French and an ensuing backlash by English-Canadians would provide ammunition to Charest's adversaries in the Parti Québécois in their campaign to revive the identity issue.</p>
<p>English-Canadians, however, might not be the only ones who consider Charest's pre-occupation with services in French in far-off B.C. to be hypocritical.</p>
<p>Perception is reality in politics, and there's a growing perception among French-speaking Quebecers, and not only language militants, that it's hard to get service in French in businesses in the western half of Montreal.</p>
<p>Yet Charest has been less outspoken about the situation of French in downtown Montreal every day than at the Whistler, B.C. ski resort for three weeks in February.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Charest invited cameras to show him getting vaccinated against the H1N1 virus as an example for other Quebecers.</p>
<p>He could show similar leadership on the language issue by launching a campaign of persuasion directed at merchants in English and French. If nothing else, it might show French-speaking Quebecers that their premier shares their concern.</p>
<p>Instead, he's left it to the Impératif Français movement to spearhead a campaign supported by the government's Office québécois de la langue française encouraging Quebecers to do their Christmas shopping only in stores that serve them in French.</p>
<p>Charest seems to fear that if he admits there's a problem at home, it will only encourage the PQ to demand new, coercive measures. Maybe it's safer to defend French in distant B.C. instead.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Canada is in discussions with pandemic vaccine maker GlaxoSmithKline and with the World Health Organization about what to do with the country's expected surplus of H1N1 vaccine, the head of the Public Health Agency of Canada said yesterday.</p>
<p>By the end of this week nearly 24 million doses will have been shipped to provinces and territories, which are reporting that demand for H1N1 shots is subsiding.</p>
<p>But that is only half of the country's total order of 50.4 million doses, placed when it was thought two shots per person might be needed for protection.</p>
<p>While public health officials still hope to be able to persuade more Canadians to get vaccinated, the possibility exists that the country may have as much as half of its vaccine order go unclaimed.</p>
<p>"Obviously our hope is that far more people will be immunized because we're far from done (with) this virus," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the public health agency and Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>But if that doesn't happen, "vaccine will not be wasted," he insisted.</p>
<p>"There's a tremendous demand around the world."</p>

<p>The H1N1 outbreak appears to be over in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Public health will wait one more week to ensure the numbers don't spike again before making it official.</p>
<p>But last week, only 1 per cent of people with flu-like symptoms tested had H1N1.</p>
<p>The normal range for positive flu tests for this time of year is between zero and 5 per cent.</p>
<p>"For all intents and purposes, it looks like the wave has passed," said Dr. Chris Mackie, a Hamilton associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The outbreak is still going in Halton, which hasn't seen the same rapid decline in H1N1 as Hamilton. Numbers for last week weren't available yet. But during the last week of November, nearly 17 per cent of people with flu-like symptoms tested had H1N1, compared to 9 per cent in Hamilton.</p>
<p>At Halton's hospitals, 8 to 19 per cent of people coming to emergency have influenza-like illness. And six patients with flu symptoms were admitted to Halton hospitals Tuesday. Two of them are now on ventilators.</p>
<p>"We're seeing a lot of what we see in the winter," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health. "But we certainly are well past the peak of the cases."</p>
<p>With the numbers so far below peak levels in Hamilton, Mackie says he doesn't expect to see a third wave of H1N1 this winter.</p>
<p>"We are so low right now, it's further evidence we won't see another wave," he said. "There is a lot of natural and vaccination-acquired immunity in the community."</p>
<p>Last week, the number of positive tests in Hamilton was the lowest it's been in about nine months.</p>
<p>Last year's peak of seasonal influenza ran right into the first H1N1 wave in the spring. The numbers dropped in the summer but hovered above normal until the second wave hit in the fall, peaking around the end of October.</p>
<p>Mackie doesn't expect to see much seasonal flu this season as the pandemic strain normally squeezes out seasonal influenza. However, flu can be unpredictable.</p>
<p>Both Mackie and Nosal still recommend getting the H1N1 flu shot despite the outbreak appearing to be over or close to it. There will still be some cases, Nosal said, and "for those especially in the high-risk groups, it is a good idea to be immunized."</p>
<p>There are no more clinics in Hamilton, but residents can get the shot at doctors' offices, walk-in clinics and by appointment at regularly scheduled public health vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Halton is running clinics until Tuesday. Residents can get both the H1N1 and seasonal flu shots.</p>
<p>Nosal says there is still a lot of interest in Halton, with about 1,300 H1N1 or seasonal shots given in Burlington yesterday and another 2,400 shots in the rest of the region.</p>

<p>It was puppy love versus the H1N1 flu for nine-month-old Ellica Martin.</p>
<p>Puppy love won.</p>
<p>Martin may have cried on Wednesday when the needle for H1N1 was poked into her leg, but her tears soon turned to fascination when she came face to face with a dog's furry face.</p>
<p>Martin was just the latest child to meet and be comforted by Lucky, a four-year-old Australian shepherd-border collie cross.</p>
<p>Lucky, with her owner Lucy Johnston, was volunteering with St. John Ambulance at the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's mass immunization clinic at the Indo-Canadian Arts and Cultural Centre on St. Mary's Road.</p>
<p>Ellica's mom, Angela, said the presence of Lucky -- who sat in the chair beside the baby while she got the shot -- meant fewer tears were shed than after her first H1N1 shot a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>"The dog helped her," she said few minutes after her daughter was reaching out and touching the dog's black, white and brown fur..</p>
<p>"We have two dogs at home so it is something familiar for her. And it's definitely good for the older kids -- and good for the parents bringing them in. It makes for a little bit less stress."</p>
<p>Johnston said she's seen the canine's positive effect on children who have been immunized in the seven weeks of the mass immunization campaign.</p>
<p>"She's a distraction for them," she said. "They can pat her. They can look at her when they get the needle. It helps them."</p>
<p>Andrea Herbert-Lugsdin, a nurse at the clinic, said she also sees the dog helping kids cope with their nervousness getting the needle.</p>
<p>"It's nice the kids associate something nice with having a needle," Herbert-Lugsdin said.</p>
<p>Nearby, six-year-old Alyssa McCaughan also fresh from having her needle, said the dog stayed with her while she got the shot.</p>
<p>"It was nice to see a dog here," she said. "I was ready to get the shot anyway."</p>
<p>Christine Kaskiw, St. John's director of community services, said they have 200 dogs and volunteers throughout Manitoba, Nunavut and Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>"The dogs and the volunteers donate their time," Kaskiw said. "We're very honoured to give back to the community at this time."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham said the need for people to be immunized for H1N1 remains strong, even as it winds down the mass immunization clinics at the end of this week.</p>
<p>Graham said people will be able to get immunized at smaller community clinics that are planned.</p>

<p>Sara Renner is worried there won't be enough snow for her to ski a World Cup cross-country race in Slovenia next week.</p>
<p>The Olympic silver medallist said her sport is a canary in the coal mine for climate change.</p>
<p>Renner, from Canmore, Alta., is one of 20 athletes, including Olympic gold medallists Hayley Wickenheiser, Jennifer Heil and Beckie Scott, who have signed a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper urging him to support a binding agreement at the ongoing UN climate summit in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Renner doesn't know where she'll be racing next week.</p>
<p>"There's not enough snow and they're making the decision tomorrow as to whether they'll be able to host the event or whether they'll have to change it," Renner said Wednesday from Switzerland.</p>
<p>"This is an issue that is affecting freestyle skiing, who now have had a World Cup cancelled in France and used Finland as a replacement site. This is a reality for our sport. It's reality becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>"It might be minus 30 C in Canmore or Calgary, but it's definitely not here."</p>
<p>The athletes are asking Harper to help find a solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Not only are winter sports in peril, they say, but iconic Canadian activities such as ice fishing and pond hockey.</p>
<p>"I'm really disappointed we have such weak leadership on this issue," Renner said.</p>

<p>JONES STRIPPED: It's time to rewrite the Olympic record books: There was no gold medal winner in the women's 100 metres at the 2000 Sydney Games.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee on Wednesday reallocated two individual medals stripped from Marion Jones for doping, but in an unprecedented move withheld her 100-metre prize from Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou because of her "disgraceful" behaviour in evading drug tests at the 2004 Athens Olympics.</p>

<p>Game Day: Las Vegas at Victoria, 7 P.M.</p>
<p>Brady Leavold is hoping to be dealt a better hand this week, and what more appropriate team to have that happen against than Las Vegas?</p>
<p>The veteran Victoria Salmon King returns to a last-place ECHL club desperate for answers and hoping to find some in Leavold, a battling five-foot-11, 190-pound forward who brought grit and presence to the Salmon Kings in the past.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Port Coquitlam native was re-signed yesterday and will see action when the Salmon Kings (6-13-3) host the Phoenix Coyotes-affiliate Las Vegas Wranglers (9-12-1) tonight, tomorrow and Saturday at 7 p.m. inside Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre.</p>
<p>Leavold returns after suffering from H1N1 and failing the physical exam in Salmon Kings training camp. A subsequent stint with the Tilburg Trappers in Holland lasted only a blink because of homesickness and incompatibility.</p>
<p>"It's been a tough year for me," noted Leavold, whose breakout final season of junior in the WHL with the Kelowna Rockets in 2007-08 consisted of 33 goals, 77 points and 158 penalty minutes in 74 regular season and playoff games.</p>
<p>"I was in bed for seven days and couldn't walk around the time of training camp and I felt that all my hard work from over the summer was wasted. When your body wants to shut down, there is nothing you can do about it. Then the offer came from Europe for decent money but I was done in two days. It wasn't for me. I was away from my family and missed my kids. And the hockey was too soft with too many dives. It was more like soccer."</p>
<p>With both Leavold and the Salmon Kings looking to find themselves this season, this seems like a remarriage that was destined to happen.</p>
<p>"The team is in a tough spot and I hope I can add some things of value to help get the guys going," said Leavold, who has 15 goals in 49 professional regular season and playoff games, 43 of those games with the Salmon Kings, four in the AHL and two in Holland.</p>
<p>"Whether it's a big hit, fight or goal, I'll do anything."</p>
<p>Among the most compelling aspects of minor-pro hockey is watching players give their lifelong dream one final chance. Leavold is a father of two, 21-month-old daughter Brooklyn and three-month-old son Brode, and knows if it is to happen for him in hockey it must be now.</p>
<p>"You've brought your game this far, you want to give hockey one more shot," said Leavold.</p>
<p>He now has that back with a team he knows and one that currently needs everybody's shots to be their best ones.</p>
<p>"They are looking for guys who want to be here," said Leavold.</p>
<p>"I've been following the team [Salmon Kings] closely and this is a great group of guys that is close to winning," said Leavold, who travelled with the team but did not play in the recent four-game road swing through Vegas and Southern California that netted only two of a possible eight points.</p>
<p>"They have fallen just short in so many one-goal games. They haven't been blown out. There are a lot of guys on this club with skill and I feel we are very close to turning things."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health-care workers less likely to have flu vaccinations: VIHA</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>505 words</div><div>10 December 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>Health-care workers on Vancouver Island are less likely to have received the vaccine for H1N1 swine flu than the general public, newly released figures show.</p>
<p>Shannon Marshall, spokeswoman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said only 31 per cent of employees for the authority are known to have been immunized, fewer than the estimated 35 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Marshall also said while the authority held vaccination clinics at work sites, some workers may have gone elsewhere and those numbers haven't been tallied. VIHA has, however, requested that workers report when they are vaccinated.</p>
<p>She said the authority strongly encourages workers to become immunized, but there is little the authority can do to ensure they comply.</p>
<p>Under collective agreements, the authority can only deny unvaccinated employees entry to the worksite under some circumstances, such as a disease outbreak. That might result in a loss of pay, but it's a move rarely taken, Marshall said.</p>
<p>Provincewide, the immunization rate among health-care workers is higher than on Vancouver Island, between 40 to 50 per cent, B.C. Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Perry Kendall said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Kendall said health-care workers have a professional responsibility to become vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I would like to take the opportunity to encourage health-care workers to ensure they get vaccinated, to protect themselves and their families, of course, but also to protect the vulnerable people for whom they care," he said.</p>
<p>Kendall said a number of H1N1 outbreaks have occurred in long-term care facilities, "and they can be prevented."</p>
<p>Representatives of the B.C. Nurses' Union, with 5,500 members working for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, did not comment on the apparently low turnout of its membership.</p>
<p>But Margi Blamey, spokeswoman for the Hospital Employees' Union with roughly 6,900 Island members, said the union strongly encourages its membership to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"We encourage them to get it, but it's their choice and we respect that they have that choice," she said.</p>
<p>Blamey also noted it's been shown workers will get vaccinated when immunizers show up on the ward or in the department instead of hosting a clinic on site.</p>
<p>Dr. Bill Cavers, a Victoria general practitioner who has criticized the immunization campaign, especially its failure to utilize family doctors, said the low uptake of health-care workers is likely due to poor organization by VIHA.</p>
<p>"It [the immunization campaign] didn't meet the needs of the average person because it required them to take a substantial amount of time out of their daily schedule and go and wait in line," said Cavers.</p>
<p>Immunization clinics began on the Island on Oct. 26 and end next week. As of last Friday about 2.1 million doses of vaccine have been distributed throughout the province. Public health officials hope they can reach 66 per cent of the population by Christmas.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Statistics record Canadian soldiers taking fewer sick days</p>
<p>New statistics suggest Canadian soldiers are taking fewer sick days despite increasingly heavy combat in Afghanistan. Figures from Canadian Forces Health Services show sick leave is on a downward trend in all areas except among Air Force personnel forced to stay home because of post-traumatic stress disorder. Officials suggest that could be due to the growing number of airmen who are now deploying to Afghanistan to operate helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Harper's communications team expect to spend $1.7M more</p>
<p>Taxpayers are being asked to pay an extra $1.7 million this fiscal year to help bolster Stephen Harper's communications support services - just as the Prime Minister's Office begins distributing government videos of Harper to the news media. Supplementary estimates tabled last month by the Privy Council Office, the prime minister's bureaucratic back office, boosted internal operational spending by almost</p>
<p>$7.3 million for 2009-10. That's on top of existing budgets.</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Report on poverty urges</p>
<p>higher tax benefits for poor</p>
<p>A Senate report on poverty says tax benefits for the poor should be increased to give them a guaranteed income equal to what is called the low-income cut-off line. The report from the social affairs committee urges a federal minimum wage of $10 and says that child tax benefits should gradually rise to $5,000. The report says government's goal should be to get people out of poverty, rather than trying to make poverty more manageable. The 74 recommendations in the 290-page report cover everything from the general problems of getting people off welfare, to social housing, help for aboriginals and refugees and a federal-provincial strategy for early-childhood education.</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Family pleads for witnesses</p>
<p>to son's death to step forward</p>
<p>Family members of a man who was beaten up, run over by an SUV and left for dead on a Toronto street are calling the killers "cowards" who should turn themselves in to give the family some peace. Toronto police announced a $50,000 reward while the family of Christopher Skinner separately put up another $25,000 Tuesday for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the aspiring law student's death. They stood just steps away from where the 27-year-old man was attacked in the early morning of Oct. 18 and appealed for witnesses to come forward.</p>
<p>QUEBEC</p>
<p>Quebec union calls for tax increase to eliminate deficit</p>
<p>One of Quebec's largest unions is asking the provincial government to increase taxes by almost</p>
<p>$1 billion. The Confederation of National Trade Unions says that would be a better way to eliminate the province's roughly $4.7-billion deficit than simple budget cuts. Public-sector workers want an</p>
<p>11.2 per cent raise over three years and union leaders want the government to abandon plans to cap the size of government.</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Hammock-like baby beds recalled after deaths</p>
<p>Two infant deaths in the U.S. have led to the recall of Amby Baby Motion Beds in that country, and Health Canada is advising Canadians to stop using the hammock-like baby bed due to a potential suffocation hazard. Health Canada hasn't received any reports of incidents or injuries in Canada related to the products, but says they should be disassembled and disposed of, and consumers are encouraged to notify the department if they find the products for sale.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama refocuses</b>
</div><div>By Doyle McManus   </div>
<div>828 words</div><div>9 December 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>Last week, Barack Obama did something unusual for a president: He acknowledged that he made mistakes in his first months. Even more surprising, he seems to have learned from them.</p>
<p>He didn't make an explicit confession; presidents don't relish displaying their lapses in judgment. But in his actions on two major issues - Afghanistan and the economy - Obama implicitly admitted that his initial decisions weren't perfect and sought to correct his course. And in a third, broader change, the president is now trying to keep his public focus on a few priorities at a time, not the dizzying list of goals that sometimes made his efforts look scattershot.</p>
<p>On Afghanistan, aides say Obama regrets the hasty decision he made in March to announce that the goal in Afghanistan was to defeat the Taliban and forge a stable democracy. Obama told columnists last week he realizes his initial definition of the mission was too grand and led his military commanders to "start viewing the mission expansively.'' Instead, he said, he wanted to define a "narrow mission'' - not building a new Afghanistan, merely "ensuring enough stability that we're able to keep pressure on al-Qaida.''</p>
<p>On the economy, Obama's position most of the year has been that the $787-billion stimulus Congress passed in February was all the major spending he could afford. But an unemployment rate at 10 per cent has sent House Democrats into justified panic over their own jobs, so the White House reluctantly has agreed that something more is needed - as long as it doesn't cost too much and further deepen the deficit.</p>
<p>In a speech Tuesday, Obama will unveil a "surgical'' plan that may include tax credits for businesses that create jobs, a "cash for caulkers'' program to subsidize household energy conservation and an "infrastructure bank'' to fund road and bridge construction.</p>
<p>Just as striking as Obama's policy shifts, though, is a third course correction in the White House: a commitment to focus on only a few issues at a time, at least publicly.</p>
<p>When Obama came to office, he announced a vaulting ambition to work on a long list of problems all at once: Yes he would focus on the economy but also on health care, energy, climate change, education and immigration; not only on Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran but also on the rest of the Muslim world, nuclear disarmament, Russia and Guantanamo.</p>
<p>Critics, including some Democrats, said he was spreading himself too thin. The president and his defenders replied, legitimately, that all those problems deserved attention. But the political impact was decisive: Voters began to ask whether a leader who made eight foreign trips in 10 months, more than any of his predecessors, was keeping his eye on the ball.</p>
<p>That's why the White House held an on-camera "job summit'' Thursday - and why Vice-President Joe Biden urged participants to forget that Obama had just spent months thinking about Afghanistan and health care.</p>
<p>"His laser focus,'' Biden said implausibly but loyally, has been "jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.''</p>
<p>In fact, Obama's fondness for domestic "summits'' - he's sponsored no fewer than five - is another reflection of how many "top'' priorities his White House has embraced. There's been a fiscal responsibility summit, a health-care summit and an H1N1 preparedness summit. His secretary of transportation even held a distracted-driving summit; but that one, at least, didn't rate a visit from the president.</p>
<p>None of this is to say Obama has solved his focus problem completely. This week, after only a few days of laser-like concentration on the jobs issue, he'll be in Norway to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize, then Denmark for (another) summit on climate change. Once again, diplomacy and circumstance have seized control of his schedule.</p>
<p>But Obama and his aides know that's not what they need. The president's next 10 months, one aide promised wryly, will see more trips to places like Pennsylvania and fewer to Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Obama still wishes he could do more. What he wants to be working on, he told columnists wistfully last week, is "improving our science and technology, making sure our schools work, getting serious about clean energy, fixing our health care system, stabilizing our deficit and our debt.''</p>
<p>But events have forced him to perform triage on his priorities. A promised push for energy legislation is waiting for the health care debate to end. A promised attempt at immigration reform may never come.</p>
<p>Instead, the sprawling agenda has been boiled down to three top-tier items: jobs, health care, Afghanistan. If Obama succeeds at those, he'll be in a stronger position to tackle the rest of the list; if not, the rest won't matter.</p>
<p>After almost 11 months on the job, U.S. President Barack Obama seems to have shifted his focus to his nation's most immediate problems. Associated Press    </p>

<div id="hd"><b>Lack of pediatricians hurting Canadian kids; Children in need of ongoing care are suffering, a new study says</b>
</div><div>Laura Stone   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>380 words</div><div>9 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>A shortage of pediatricians is hurting Canadian children, especially those with chronic, long-term health problems, says a report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>While kids in Canada have adequate emergency services, those who require ongoing care are suffering due to a shortage of doctors and long waiting lists, said the report, conducted by the Canadian Paediatric Society and entitled Are We Doing Enough?</p>
<p>"This year is worse than ever, because the docs have had to deal with a lot more infectious disease this year because of H1N1," said Marie Adele Davis, executive director of the society, which represents approximately 2,500 pediatricians and specialists.</p>
<p>"It means again that the kids with less urgent (problems) are probably having to wait even longer because the pediatricians are so busy dealing with the kids with the flu."</p>
<p>Children with mental health-issues, or behavioural problems such as ADHD or anxiety, can't get the thorough care they need--and that can have long-lasting effects, Davis said.</p>
<p>"If you miss a day or two of school it's not so bad, but when you're constantly, constantly falling behind, it adds up and it can have some pretty serious lifelong consequences in terms of being able to finish school, go to university, get a good job," she said.</p>
<p>While there is no cross-Canada survey of wait times, Davis said she has heard anecdotal evidence that some children in Toronto are waiting up to 18 months to see a mental-health professional.</p>
<p>There are also chronic health issues, such as obesity, diabetes and asthma, that are not being effectively treated, she said.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that aging pediatricians are not being replaced by younger doctors as they retire. The problem, according to the report, is most pronounced in rural communities.</p>
<p>The report asks federal and provincial governments to work together to create a comprehensive system to monitor wait times and a human resources strategy to replace doctors to meet children's needs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>1918 flu, H1N1 have similarities; Deep lung damage, younger victims common to both</b>
</div><div>Delthia Ricks   </div>

<div>306 words</div><div>9 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final C</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Fatal cases of swine flu result from a devastating form of lung damage virtually identical to the pulmonary devastation caused in the 1918 and 1957 global flu outbreaks, confirming that H1N1 is more like its pandemic cousins than seasonal strains of influenza, scientists reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>But while autopsy data of 34 people who died of H1N1 earlier this year adds yet another chapter to medicine's knowledge of pandemic influenza, another study suggests that by the time the current flu season is over, H1N1 will not have been a potent threat to most people.</p>
<p>The autopsy studies involved people who died between May 15 and July 9, and revealed a consistent pattern of deeply penetrating damage throughout the lungs' lower airways, said Dr. James Gill of the New York City medical examiner's office, which conducted the study along with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>"Pathologically, it's very similar to [autopsy findings] in the 1957 and 1918 pandemics," Gill said, noting as previous studies have also revealed, a preponderance of flu deaths in younger people -- infants to adults up to age 49. Seasonal influenza, by contrast, is most devastating among the elderly, he said, and primarily causes upper respiratory infections.</p>
<p>Gill said death was swift for all who succumbed to swine flu, a course that proceeded rapidly downhill within a matter of days. Some people died before hospitalization, he said.</p>
<p>But despite the bad news, a U.S. and British team of scientists in mathematical studies of the swine flu pandemic say that by the time it's over it will have produced a fatality rate of only 0.1 per cent, or one death for every 1,000 symptomatic cases.</p>

<p>The additives in the adjuvant vaccine help boost the immune response and stretch the vaccine's active ingredient so less can be used in each dose.</p>
<p>Kendall said B.C. has submitted at least 232 reports of moderate to serious adverse reactions in 176 people (some had multiple symptoms) to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>Of those, only eight were considered life-threatening, including five cases of anaphylaxis, one seizure, one case of fainting involving an injury from the fall and one death in a man who was vaccinated and then got H1N1 soon after. The death has been attributed to the flu, not the vaccine, and it is believed the man contracted the flu before the vaccine took effect.</p>
<p>The 232 adverse events, associated with 1.3 million vaccinations, also included severe pain, fevers accompanied by other symptoms like seizures, and joint pain.</p>
<p>Dr. Monika Naus, medical director of the BC Centre for Disease Control's immunization program, said the rate of serious events in B.C. (less than one in 100,000) has so far been comparable to what is seen with seasonal influenza vaccinations.</p>
<p>Dropping demand for the vaccine prompted Tuesday's announcement of an end to mass immunization clinics in malls, schools and community centres as of Dec. 18. After that, people can get the vaccinations at doctors' offices and public health clinics.</p>
<p>In his weekly teleconference with the media, Kendall said the death toll in B.C. from the H1N1 pandemic flu virus has climbed to 47.</p>
<p>In that number, health officials are including three deaths in the past week and two others reported more than week after the individuals in the Interior region died.</p>
<p>Of the 47 deaths, 40 have been in people with underlying health conditions. In the past week, there have been 32 new severe cases of H1N1 resulting in hospitalization.</p>
<p>Since April, the BC Centre for Disease Control has confirmed 1,009 severe H1N1 cases resulting in hospitalization.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Execs to tackle troubled health agency; Ottawa Hospital management team to help reverse home-care woes</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>913 words</div><div>9 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>A vice-president at The Ottawa Hospital has been tapped to become the interim chief executive of Eastern Ontario's beleaguered home-care agency.</p>
<p>Starting next Tuesday, Cameron Love will take over as head of the Champlain Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) as part of a year-long management agreement that will see other Ottawa Hospital executives lend their expertise in an attempt turn around the troubled agency, which is also in charge of nursing-home admissions in the region.</p>
<p>"He's coming with the resources of The Ottawa Hospital," said Lynn Graham, the CCAC's chairwoman. "It's that kind of team support that we are looking at."</p>
<p>The deal means Eastern Ontario's largest health-care provider will effectively assume the day-to-day management of the second-largest health agency in the region, at least until a permanent chief executive is appointed sometime in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The interim management team would continue to report to the CCAC's board, said Graham.</p>
<p>Love replaces Patrice Connolly, a CCAC vice-president who took over briefly from chief executive Sheila Bauer.</p>
<p>Bauer stepped down last month after the agency overspent its budget by $6.5 million and had to scale back services for the 56,000 frail, sick and dying Eastern Ontarians who rely on home care each year as a more humane, less costly alternative to crowded hospitals and nursing homes.</p>
<p>The shortfall has made it impossible for the CCAC to balance its $180-million budget, forcing it to stop taking new clients and cut in-home services such as nursing visits, personal support and physiotherapy.</p>
<p>And because cuts to home care force more seniors into nursing homes earlier, an estimated 3,700 frail elderly across the region face longer waits to be admitted into long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>Already, Eastern Ontario seniors wait up to a year for one of the region's 7,440 nursing-home beds -- the longest delay in the province.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dying patients desperate to leave hospital have been denied their wish to spend their final days in their own homes.</p>
<p>CCAC cost-cutting measures have led to cancelled surgeries, bed shortages and long emergency-room waits in local hospitals. In recent weeks, overcrowding has resulted in some frail elderly patients parked in beds next to patients with H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The regional health authority that brokered the management deal said the CCAC needed stable leadership while the organization worked to balance its budget, fix internal problems and recruit a new chief executive.</p>
<p>Apart from The Ottawa Hospital, there were few other Eastern Ontario agencies big enough, and complex enough, to understand the challenges facing the CCAC, said Marie Fortier, chairwoman of the Champlain Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), which has authority over how provincial health dollars are spent in the region.</p>
<p>"It's pretty obvious the CCAC needed somebody to step in, and they needed somebody with an even broader perspective and a broader range of expertise within their ranks," said Fortier.</p>
<p>"The system goes into implosion when the CCAC is not functioning well, and we've seen evidence of that. So we knew that we needed something that would bring a lot of expertise quickly."</p>
<p>Fortier said the LHIN explored other options, such as hiring management consultants to run the CCAC temporarily, but the idea was deemed too expensive and time-consuming.</p>
<p>While The Ottawa Hospital will be compensated for the help it provides the CCAC, the costs are not expected to exceed the salary of the agency's chief executive, said Fortier.</p>
<p>At the time she left her job, Bauer was earning $168,000 a year as the CCAC's head.</p>
<p>"This is not a moneymaker for the hospital," said Fortier. "But if they can succeed in making a big change at the CCAC, it will be a big feather in their cap."</p>
<p>One of Love's first duties is to come up with a plan to improve staffing practices, contract management and spending controls at the CCAC. Earlier this year, an operational review of the CCAC uncovered widespread problems with the way the agency makes high-level decisions that affect the quality of home care.</p>
<p>In particular, the CCAC often operates with incomplete or out-of-date planning and financial information, said a report prepared by the consulting firm KPMG.</p>
<p>Love was not available for comment on Tuesday. But Phil Murray, chairman of The Ottawa Hospital, said the organization decided to lend the CCAC a hand to ensure that patients got the appropriate type of care they needed.</p>
<p>"We're looking at it, not in the self-interest of The Ottawa Hospital, or for that matter, of the hospital sector, but from the perspective of patient care," said Murray.</p>
<p>"Whether that takes place in the hospital or outside the hospital, it really doesn't matter to us, as long as people are getting the appropriate care at the appropriate time and place."</p>
<p>Murray said Love's role at The Ottawa Hospital makes him well suited to tackle the challenges at the CCAC.</p>
<p>As vice-president of planning, support services and clinical programs, Love spearheaded a multimillion-dollar expansion of the hospital over the past five years.</p>
<p>As a result, he has a proven track record of being able to manage large, complex projects "on time and on budget," said Murray.</p>

<p>Diabetes numbers, costs to soar by 2020 in Canada</p>
<p>A report says the number of Canadians diagnosed with diabetes and its cost to the economy are expected to soar in the next decade.</p>
<p>The report by the Canadian Diabetes Association is calling for urgent action to stem the tide of the disease.</p>
<p>The report says if left unchecked, the cost of diabetes could rise to $17 billion by 2020, an increase of more than $10 billion from 2000.</p>
<p>The number of Canadians diagnosed with diabetes will have also tripled. In terms of diabetes at a population level, that would mean almost 10 per cent of Canadians would be affected by it in 2020, up from 4 per cent in 2000.</p>
<p>Researchers question value of flu drugs</p>
<p>The British Medical Journal, researchers from the Cochrane Review and Britain's Channel 4 TV network are questioning the value of the class of flu drugs to which the medication Tamiflu belongs.</p>
<p>They say there is little evidence the drugs reduce complications of seasonal flu in otherwise healthy adults and question why the drug's manufacturer, Roche, hasn't published more data on the issue.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says the study offers nothing new to the debate on the merits of drugs like Tamiflu. Charles Penn, an antiviral expert with the agency, says WHO has said all along the drugs have a modest impact on the severity and duration of bouts of seasonal flu in healthy people.</p>
<p>And the WHO's recommendation for pandemic flu is that otherwise healthy people don't need to take the drugs to combat H1N1.</p>
<p>ICU infections prove to be deadly: study</p>
<p>Just over half of all patients in intensive care units around the world have infections, and they are more than twice as likely to die in the units as patients who are not infected, a new study has found.</p>
<p>The study surveyed the infection status of more than 13,000 patients from 1,200 noncardiac intensive care units in 75 countries on a single day -- May 8, 2007.</p>
<p>It found that 51 per cent of patients had infections, most commonly of the lung, while 71 per cent were being treated with antimicrobial agents. One-fourth of those with infections died, compared with just over one-tenth of infection-free patients.</p>
<p>The longer a patient spent in intensive care, the greater the risk of an infection: 32 per cent for patients who had been in the ICU for a day or less at the time of the survey, and 70 per cent for those who had been there for more than a week.</p>
<p>The findings are published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>

<p>Re: Cost Of Diabetes Could Hit $17B A Year By 2020: Report, Dec. 7.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of hype about the H1N1 swine flu "pandemic." In reading that the rapid increase of diabetes is about 20 people an hour, it is clear that there is a more serious health epidemic that we all should be aware of. While some being diagnosed with diabetes could have done nothing about it, the rest of us should take a serious look at our weight, our poor eating habits, our sedentary lifesyles and lack of exercise.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The local public health board has surpassed previous fall immunization campaigns against flu strains.</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health each year tries to vaccinate a large segment of the population through voluntary immunization against seasonal flu strains. That reached a peak of 15,000 doses in fall 2007.</p>
<p>This fall, it has focused more on pandemic H1N1 flu, widely seen as the greater risk to public health since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic this past summer as sit spread from Mexico and the U.S. to other nations, including Canada.</p>
<p>"We've exceeded that," health board director of public health and disease prevention Lynn Beath said Monday.</p>
<p>Her local health board has administered 30,000 H1N1 doses on area residents within its borders. With distribution of additional doses to scores of front-line family physicians, the number is closer to 82,000 doses, or 30 per cent of the population, though it's not yet clear whether doctors have given all those shots to their patients.</p>
<p>The health board continues to offer vaccination, even though community clinics end on Friday.</p>
<p>There isn't a set goal of percentage of the local population to be immunized, board communications manager Jan Craig said.</p>
<p>"We're on the provincial average.''While community clinics are coming to an end, people will still be able to get vaccinated at health board offices throughout the region without appointments until Dec. 22, Craig noted. After that, people can book appointments for such shots on clinic days at board offices, which include 600 Southgate Dr. in Guelph. More information is on the website www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org] or at 1-800-265-7293.</p>
<p>Drilling down in the data, the health board held 72 community-based flu clinics as of Dec. 3. The 30,123 doses given represent 11 per cent of the area's population, which the 2006 Census put at almost 274,000 people.</p>
<p>Participation was higher at area high schools. Public health reported 2,901 people were immunized in recent clinics at 14 of these schools.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Prescription drug deaths on rise; Fatalities from misuse of narcotic pain relievers have doubled in 13 years</b>

<div>817 words</div><div>8 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Experts call it Canada's hidden drug problem, one that kills more people than heroin overdoses. The difference?</p>
<p>Instead of scoring these drugs on the street, you can get them with the flick of doctor's pen.</p>
<p>Deaths from the misuse of prescription narcotic pain relievers have nearly doubled in 13 years, says a study released Monday.</p>
<p>When mixed with alcohol or prescription sedatives, prescription pain relievers, called opioids, can have fatal effects, say researchers involved in the study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>"This is a prominent, very prevalent problem," said Benedikt Fischer, a public health professor at Simon Fraser University.</p>
<p>"It comes from an unexpected side, namely medications we all think are just therapeutic and safe and wonderful because we get them from the pharmacy and the doctor.</p>
<p>"But they obviously bear a lot of risks and harms."</p>
<p>Fischer, who contributed a commentary on the study in the CMAJ, said while data is not available for the entire country, he suspects a surge in opioid-related deaths can be found nationwide.</p>
<p>The study found that opioid-related deaths in Ontario nearly doubled between 1991 and 2004, from about 14 people per million residents in 1991 to 27 per million in 2004.</p>
<p>Prescriptions also soared 850 per cent between 1991 and 2007 -- a trend that researchers say is directly related to the introduction of a long-lasting form of opioid known as oxycodone.</p>
<p>When oxycodone-type drugs became available publicly in the late 1990s, opioid-related deaths rose by 40 per cent, and oxycodone-related deaths increased more than fivefold. For example, 103 people died from oxycodone in 2003, as compared with 16 in 1999, the study said.</p>
<p>To put the severity of the situation into context, David Juurlink, a doctor from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto who worked on the study, said that while H1N1 has killed a little over 100 people in Canada, in the last year of the study, opioids were killing about 300 people in Ontario alone.</p>
<p>"This is a major public health issue," said Juurlink.</p>
<p>Researchers said the study's findings point to a growing trend among doctors who are prescribing narcotic pain killers, sometimes unaware of the dangers to patients.</p>
<p>They asked for an electronic database to track prescriptions in Ontario.</p>
<p>While oxycodone drugs can be effective for chronic pain such as advanced cancer, they have been prescribed more frequently for other problems, such as back pain and arthritis.</p>
<p>"We, in Canada, prescribe or use more prescription opioids than virtually any country in the world, except for the U.S.," said Fischer. When one such drug, OxyContin, was introduced to Ontario it was marketed to doctors as a safer, less addictive drug, which the study's authors said has been proven false.</p>
<p>In the U.S., senior executives at the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, which makes the drug, pleaded guilty to deceptive marketing and were ordered to pay fines in excess of $600 million in 2007.</p>
<p>In a written statement, Purdue Pharma Canada in Pickering, Ont., said it was concerned about prescription drug abuse, acknowledging it as a growing health problem.</p>
<p>"Purdue Pharma Canada will continue to do its part to help reduce diversion and abuse of medications, while making sure they remain available for appropriate medical use," it said.</p>
<p>"It is important to recognize that opioid analgesics have an established medical purpose.</p>
<p>"OxyContin remains a safe and effective medicine when used appropriately and under the supervision of a physician.</p>
<p>"Purdue Pharma Canada is continuing to provide doctors with the information and tools to help them prescribe opioid analgesics safely when medically appropriate.</p>
<p>"The marketing of OxyContin has always been conducted in compliance with all Canadian laws and the regulations for the pharmaceutical industry in Canada."</p>
<p>Irfan Dhalla, a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital and one of the study's authors, said it's not clear whether doctors and patients understand how serious the side effects can be from oxycodone drugs--which can be twice as strong as morphine.</p>
<p>"One of our messages to physicians would be: OxyContin is not just another new Tylenol 3," said Dhalla.</p>
<p>The study's medical researchers looked at nearly 7,100 files at the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario, ranging between 1991 and 2004.</p>
<p>They then compared those files with provincial data between 1991 and 2007 from pharmaceutical consulting firm <span class="companylink">IMS Health Canada</span>, an organization that tracks the sale of provincial drugs.</p>
<p>The coroner found that more than half of the opioid-related deaths in Ontario were unintentional, and another 22 per cent died from undetermined causes.</p>
<p>The average age of people who died from opioids was 40 years old. Most had visited a doctor at least once a month before their death.</p>

</p>
<p>Nearly 10 per cent of Manitobans who were on ventilators with a severe H1N1 illness last spring had a history of tuberculosis, according to the Manitoba government.</p>
<p>Provincial data obtained through a freedom of information request show that three people who were severely ill with H1N1 influenza during the first wave had been sick with active TB or had latent or "sleeping" TB infections.</p>
<p>Manitoba's chief medical officer Dr. Joel Kettner said there's no clear evidence that suggests there's a higher rate of H1N1 severe illness among people with TB.</p>
<p>However, he said many of the risk factors for both diseases overlap, including aboriginal status, living in remote northern communities, poverty and substance abuse.</p>
<p>Kettner said there is a possibility people with active TB could have damaged lungs or a weakened immune system, which may make them more susceptible to H1N1. He cautioned that more analysis of flu data are needed to determine if there is a link between the two diseases.</p>
<p>During the peak of the first wave of H1N1,38 people were on ventilators with a severe illness, and seven people died.</p>
<p>"If you had damage to your lungs from tuberculosis and now you get a severe case of H1N1, what are your chances of tolerating or surviving it? I think that could be a factor," Kettner said.</p>
<p>"However, we don't have any evidence in Manitoba to show that people with chronic lung problems associated with previous TB infection or active TB infection have been associated with levels of severe illness."</p>

<p>Experts call it Canada's hidden drug problem, one that kills more people than heroin overdoses. The difference? Instead of scoring on the street, you can get it with the flick of doctor's pen.</p>
<p>Deaths as a result of taking narcotic pain relievers, also known as opioids, have nearly doubled in 14 years, says an Ontario-based study released yesterday. In particular, deaths from oxycodone, a very potent narcotic pain killer, rose fivefold between 1999 and 2004, immediately following the introduction of OxyContin in Ontario, which is the only brand of long-acting oxycodone.</p>
<p>Most deaths occurred in individuals who were also taking sleeping pills or alcohol, said researchers involved in the study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>"This is a prominent, very prevalent problem," said Benedikt Fischer, a public health professor at Simon Fraser University.

<p>Prescriptions for oxycodone also soared 850 per cent between 1991 and 2007. Other drugs that use some form of oxycodone include Percocet.</p>

</p>
<p>Ottawa consumers are gearing up to spend this holiday season, and mall operators say they've seen the proof.</p>
<p>A survey shows the proportion planning to spend more is the highest and the proportion planning to spend less is the lowest in the six years the firm has been interviewing Ottawa residents.</p>
<p>"For retailers, this is as good as it gets,'' said Brian Card of CRG Consulting. "The bad headlines of a year ago are gone and people are feeling very optimistic."</p>
<p>Ottawa job and housing markets have rebounded after tanking last year. The unemployment rate is the lowest among major Canadian cities.</p>
<p>The survey of 440 Ottawa residents last weekend found 30.2 per cent plan to spend more, compared with just 9.3 per cent a year earlier, when worries about the global economy put consumer confidence into the tank. Only 18.5 per cent plan to spend less this year compared to 27.4 per cent a year earlier.</p>
<p>Of the balance, 46.1 plan to spend the same as a year earlier and 5.2 per cent are not sure, said the survey.</p>
<p>Cindy VanBuskirk, general manager of the Rideau Shopping Centre, said sales have been rebounding during the fall as consumer confidence rose and some new stores drove sales.</p>
<p>Foot traffic in recent weeks is running five- to seven-per-cent higher than a year earlier, before the start of the transit strike.</p>
<p>It won't take much more to make December a banner month. The transit strike that started in early December last year knocked down foot traffic by as much as 40 per cent and helped depress sales by eight per cent.</p>
<p>"The early indications we have is this is going to be a good Christmas and we will sustain the sales gains we saw in November," VanBuskirk said.</p>
<p>Denis Pelletier, general manager of Bayshore Shopping Centre, said business has grown steadily during the fall and was significantly stronger than malls in other cities.</p>
<p>"We had a real traditional Christmas weekend last weekend. The parking lot filled by 10 a.m. and was busy into the evening."</p>
<p>He said counts of full shopping bags showed consumers are not just looking. "The numbers are way up over last year."</p>
<p>Traffic at Les Promenades De L'Outaouais has increased drastically this year, said Dominique Guindon, director general. While exact numbers won't be ready until January, full parking spaces and busier stores this early in December signal a much better Christmas shopping season than she saw in 2008.</p>
<p>"Definitely, there is more foot traffic and the gift card sales are up also.''</p>
<p>Card said shoppers are not throwing caution to the wind. The survey showed 77 per cent will shop around during the holiday for the best deals. And he said public confidence could change quickly if the federal government freezes or cuts spending and jobs next year in response to a rising deficit.</p>
<p>"But people aren't thinking about that, they are just thinking about a great Christmas."</p>
<p>One thing retailers don't have to worry about is competition from the U.S.</p>
<p>Only 23 per cent of those surveyed said they will purchase gifts from the U.S. -- about the same as a year ago when the Canadian dollar was worth 82 cents, not 95 cents.</p>
<p>Card said he believes lineups and increased security at the border could be a factor. And, there are now more popular international chains in Ottawa malls.</p>
<p>Worries about the H1N1 pandemic are not frightening consumers. Only 12 per cent said it will keep them out of stores, although 47.5 per cent believe there will be another wave -- more than twice the proportion who believe it is over.</p>
<p>The lure of online shopping appears to have peaked. The survey found 45 per cent will buy some Christmas presents online, down from 47.4 per cent a year earlier.</p>
<p>Traditional barriers to online shopping are still an issue. Worries about identity theft have risen to 32.5 per cent from 26.5 per cent a year ago among people who will do all their shopping in stores.</p>
<p>Concerns about not being able to touch or feel the gift or concerns about picking the right size declined slightly.</p>
<p>While Ottawans are ready to spend, many are looking for ways to save money, particularly if it involves a gift they received and don't like.</p>
<p>The survey found that 33 per cent said they have re-gifted an unwanted present to someone else, up from 24 per cent last year.</p>
<p>With worries about the economy down, more people want a surprise under the Christmas tree. The proportion hoping for a traditional wrapped present rose to 47.5 per cent from 40.1 per cent a year earlier. About a third will be happy with cash or gift certificates, about the same as last year, and the rest don't care what form the present takes.</p>
<p>The CRG Consulting survey polled 440 Ottawa residents between Dec. 3 and Dec. 5. It said the results are considered accurate to within 4.37 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic is becoming more serious every day, and doctors' offices are getting more crowded with people who think they have the virus.</p>
<p>People who have the smallest form of a cold are going to get tested. Naomi Powell, writer for The Hamilton Spectator writes, "Family physicians associated with Hamilton Health Sciences reported a 30 per cent increase in patient demand even after postponing nonessential appointments, such as annual physicals."</p>
<p>More people need to be informed about the real symptoms and how they can be treated at home.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Mackie, the medical officer of Health says that, "(we) are relying on the public to be thoughtful about when they are seeking care."</p>
<p>The public should think about their symptoms before visiting their doctor. This way not so many people will seek medical help and people who are really sick can get the care they need.</p>
<p>Another way fewer people will get sick is to open up the shot to more people.</p>
<p>More teens are getting the virus and only health-care workers, children under five, pregnant women, seniors over 65 and people with underlying conditions such as asthma and cancer are able to receive the vaccine. But, Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer said that, "about half of the people who died of the flu in the U.S were teenagers."</p>
<p>More people need to be protected.</p>
<p>If more people are informed about serious flu symptoms and more people are able to receive the vaccination, fewer people would get sick and more people could be treated at home.</p>
<p>These things could help doctors' offices be less crowded so that the sicker people can get proper treatments.</p>

<p>COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS / NO PIG MIST IN OFFICE</p>
<p>For cubicle-bound employees, the only unexplained sickness likely to sweep through the workplace is malaise (swine flu isn't so confounding any more). But employees in 24 U.S. slaughterhouses recently learned the cause of a rash of mysterious illnesses ravaging their workplace: an autoimmune response to a mist of pig brain tissue. From Nov. 21, 2006, to May, 2008, 21 employees became ill thanks to the compressed air released from the tissue, which attacked their nervous systems and caused weakness, fatigue, confusion and seizures, the Chicago Tribune reports. Government health experts and <span class="companylink">Mayo Clinic</span> doctors published their investigation of the Minnesota and Indiana farms last week in the Lancet Neurology journal. So what's our malaise-killing advice, you ask? Think of the pig mist, and life on the cubicle farm won't seem so bad.</p>

<p>BY THE NUMBERS / NUMBNESS: PRICELESS</p>
<p>$292,000</p>
<p>Amount of money (U.S.) that an anesthesiologist makes annually on average, according to CNN Money's list of America's top-paying jobs, released last week. These hospital staffers, who placed first on the list, deserve their annual income (the top dogs pull in up to $408,000) since they hold patients' lives in their hands. And think of all the gas jokes they have to endure.</p>
<p>$140,000</p>
<p>The cash raked in by a sales director, the fifth-highest-paid profession and the first non-medical gig on the list (obstetricians/gynecologists, shrinks and nurse-anesthetists rounded out the top five). Sales directors make so much because they essentially earn all the money for their company. The really good ones make as much as $239,000: dough their money-hungry staffers can only dream of.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>TOO GOOD TO HIRE / GOOGLE SHARING</p>
<p>It's important that we not hire these guys. It's better for the ecosystem to have an honest industry, as opposed to aggregating all this talent at <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p>- Google vice-president Bradley Horowitz on why his company intentionally turns away some perfectly brilliant job applicants.</p>
<p>Mr. Horowitz professed his company's selflessness at the annual Supernova conference in San Francisco last week, saying it would be unfair and greedy to hire too many smart people to work for the top tech company. While puzzled, the bloggers at Gawker.com say at least <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s using the system for good by shunning people for being too brilliant. “Now that's Christmas spirit: It's sort of a gift to the world.”</p>
<p>There's no doubt these <span class="companylink">Google</span>-shunned brainiacs are hightailing it to the next-greenest pastures. We expect a mega-search engine of Revenge any day now.</p>

<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>U.K.'S PM STRESSES AFGHAN RESOLVE</p>
<p>LONDON - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged to "stay the course" in Afghani-stan on Monday as the British military death toll there this year reached 100.</p>
<p>A British soldier was shot dead in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan, on Monday, raising the total to 100 since January, the government said.</p>
<p>British troops have been involved in a U.S.-led assault on a Taliban stronghold in Helmand in the last few days.</p>
<p>ACTIVIST REFUSES TO END HUNGER STRIKE</p>
<p>LANZAROTE - A Western Sahara activist vowed Monday to push on with a three-week-old hunger strike at a Spanish airport to demand Morocco allow her to return home, despite pressure from Spain.</p>
<p>Aminatou Haidar has been consuming only sugared water since Nov. 16, days after Moroccan authorities denied her entry to her native Western Sahara, a disputed territory annexed by Morocco in 1975, allegedly confiscated her passport, and sent her back to Spain's Canary Islands.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who campaigns for the Western Sahara's independence from Morocco, is occasionally helped into a wheelchair to be taken to the toilet.</p>
<p>She appeared very weak and thin and spoke with a weak voice, but was still lucid and coherent.</p>
<p>NATO ALLIES AGREE TO TROOP SURGE</p>
<p>BRUSSELS - NATO allies have agreed to support the U.S. troop surge in Afghanistan with 7,000 more troops, the organization's Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday.</p>
<p>And there would be more to come in 2010, Rasmussen added.</p>
<p>"On top of the 30,000 forces coming from the United States, NATO allies and partners have made pledges to add almost 7,000 extra forces to the mission," said a statement from Rasmussen released after a meeting of military leaders.</p>
<p>"There is now more work to be done to turn these basic figures into capability on the ground, and in particular to focus on the critical area of training the Afghan security forces," he said.</p>
<p>Military sources told AFP that France and Germany had nothing more to offer, at least not before the international conference on Afghanistan scheduled for Jan. 28.</p>
<p>A number of U.S. allies have promised to send extra troops to back U.S. President Barack Obama's new strategy to end the conflict in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The 37,000-strong boost in troop numbers will bring the NATO-led ISAF force strength up to some 150,000 by 2010, of whom two-thirds are American.</p>
<p>UN COURT REJECTS KARADZIC CHALLENGE</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - The UN criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia on Monday rejected a motion by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic challenging the legitimacy of the court to try him for war crimes.</p>
<p>Karadzic, facing 11 charges of war crimes arising from the 1992-95 Bosnian war, including genocide at Srebrenica, lodged a motion last month arguing that the court was a prosecuting organ of the U.N. Security Council.</p>
<p>The court said Karadzic's motion that the tribunal was not legally constituted was without merit and such a decision should not come as a surprise to him given the history of the case.</p>
<p>"The trial chamber wishes to emphasize to the accused, yet again, that his efforts and resources are best directed towards preparing for the resumption of his trial," the ruling said.</p>
<p>Karadzic, who faces life imprisonment in connection with such events as the 43-month siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo which began in 1992, has denied all charges and boycotted the first three days of his trial to demand more preparation time.</p>
<p>Since his arrival in The Hague in July 2008, Karadzic has argued he was promised immunity in a secret deal with U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke on condition that he disappear from public life. Holbrooke has denied any such agreement.</p>
<p>The tribunal has also said such a deal, if it existed, would not limit the court's jurisdiction and opted to start the trial and appoint a defence lawyer. Karadzic has filed a motion to replace the counsel chosen for him.</p>
<p>HITLER SKULL FRAGMENT AUTHENTIC</p>
<p>MOSCOW - An officer with the Russian intelligence service the FSB on Monday dismissed a U.S. report suggesting a fragment of Hitler's skull held in Moscow is actually from a woman, insisting their relic is genuine.</p>
<p>"The FSB archives hold the jaw of Hitler and the state archives a fragment of Hitler's skull," said Vassili Khristoforov, head of the FSB archives, told Interfax.</p>
<p>"With the exception of these remains, seized on May 5, 1945, there exist no other bits from the body of Hitler," he added.</p>
<p>In September academics from the University of Connecticut said their DNA analysis showed the skull fragment to be that of a woman, aged between 20 and 40.</p>
<p>They did not test the jawbone.</p>
<p>The researchers had not approached the FSB archives about testing the jawbone, said Khristoforov.</p>
<p>"And even if they had the DNA of our fragments, with what could they then have compared it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"These remains are unique, there is nothing comparable. We are talking about the only evidence of this kind of the death of Hitler, and that is why the FSB had kept it in its archives."</p>
<p>Some Russian officials and scientists had in any case already expressed doubts about the skull fragment.</p>
<p>But the latest comments came against a background of doubts over what really happened in Berlin during the last days of the Nazi regime.</p>
<p>For decades, there has been speculation that Hitler might have escaped -- despite reports from both Soviet troops and British intelligence agents at the time that concluded that Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun died in the bunker.</p>
<p>NORTH KOREA URGED TO OPEN UP</p>
<p>GENEVA - North Korea on Monday faced a barrage of demands from western countries to open up to international organizations and independent monitors in order to improve the human rights situation there.</p>
<p>During a hearing at the UN Human Rights Council, countries including France, Australia and Britain called on Pyongyang to work with UN organizations and non-governmental organizations to help feed its population and provide essential aid such as medicines.</p>
<p>Others such as the United States also asked North Korea to grant access for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and allow an independent assessment on the situation in the isolated country.</p>
<p>VIOLENCE ERUPTS AT ATHENS DEMO</p>
<p>ATHENS - Riot police clashed with stone-throwing youths in Athens on Monday as violence marred a second day of demonstrations held to mark the fatal shooting of a teenager by police a year ago.</p>
<p>Police charged the crowd with tear gas and made 21 arrests after scores of youths, some as young as 12, hurled stones at store windows and the security forces as some 5,000 demonstrators set off towards parliament.</p>
<p>Two of the youths were arrested earlier for pelting a police station with stones as thousands of students rallied to pay tribute to Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead at age 15 last year, a police source said.</p>
<p>Two other police stations in the suburbs of Agia Paraskevi and Kallithea were also pelted with debris, police said.</p>

<p>POLICE USED TOO MUCH FORCE</p>
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazilian police in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo "routinely" carry out unlawful executions, worsening a spiral of violence in the cities, the group Human Rights Watch charged Tuesday.</p>
<p>A forensic study of 51 suspect deaths by police found that at least 33 were likely examples of unjustified lethal force, the New York-based rights group said in a 122-page report to be released at a Rio press conference.</p>
<p>Seventeen of the cases "show that police shot their victims at point blank range," it said.</p>
<p>"The 51 cases do not represent the totality of potential extrajudicial killings, but are indicative of a much broader problem," the report added.</p>
<p>The study was released amid rising international concern about rampant crime in Brazil and the reliability of law enforcement as Rio prepares to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games.</p>
<p>In October, Rio police launched a big operation against drug gangs that rule many of the city's slums after one of them shot down a police helicopter, killing three officers.</p>
<p>MILLIONS STOLEN DURING SOCCER FINAL</p>
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO - Thieves took advantage of Brazil's passion for soccer to steal about $6 million from a cash delivery firm, as the nation was transfixed on championship games, media reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Police suspect the thieves tunneled into the firm's building in Sao Paulo and waited until Sunday afternoon, when the final games of the national championships were played, to break in and steal more than 10 million reais ($5.7 million).</p>
<p>POLICE BREAK WORK VISA FRAUD RING</p>
<p>SAO PAULO - Brazilian police on Monday broke a vast international ring that netted $50 million from applicants paying to fraudulently obtain U.S. work visas, U.S. and Brazilian officials in Sao Paulo said.</p>
<p>At least 11 people were arrested under 19 warrants issued in Brazil, Sao Paulo state prosecutors said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ring allegedly took up to $15,000 per applicant on the promise to obtain an H-2B temporary work visa for them for the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. consulate first detected fraud in the visa paperwork in 2003, launching a long joint investigation with Brazilian authorities called Operation Anarchy that involved wiretaps and a Brazilian undercover agent infiltrating the ring.</p>
<p>ARRESTS MADE IN 1982 ASSASSINATION</p>
<p>SANTIAGO - Chilean officials on Monday arrested six people, including four doctors, for their role in the alleged assassination in 1982 of former president Eduardo Frei Montalva, court sources told AFP.</p>
<p>Frei, the father of former president and current candidate for next Sunday's presidential elections, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, died from infection following what had begun as a routine surgery at a private clinic in Santiago.</p>
<p>The former Christian Democratic party leader's family is convinced he was victim of assassination by secret police operating under the 1973-90 military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.</p>

<p>SWINE FLU DEATHS REPORTED IN GAZA</p>
<p>GAZA CITY - A baby and two women have died in Hamas-run Gaza after contracting swine flu, the first deaths from the virus in the densely populated Palestinian territory, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Hassan Khalaf, a spokesman for the Hamas health ministry, declined to give details, but said there were four new cases on Monday of people infected with the disease in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Khalaf added, however, that the condition of three of five people who had been confirmed on Sunday as having the virus was improving.</p>
<p>Those were the first of the A(H1N1) flu reported in Gaza, which Israel and Egypt have kept under a blockade, allowing in only essential humanitarian aid, since the Islamist Hamas seized power in June 2007.</p>

<p>5.9 EARTHQUAKE HITS MALAWI</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - A magnitude 5.9 quake struck northern Malawi today, close to the Tanzanian border, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.</p>
<p>The quake, only 10 kilometres deep, followed a series of quakes in the same area, the uranium-rich Karonga district, for two days running.</p>
<p>The epicentre was 175 km north of Mzuzu, Malawi's third largest city, and 125 km southeast of the Tanzanian town of Mbeya.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.</p>
<p>Authorities in Karonga were on high alert in the aftermath of the tremors, which on Sunday injured six people, two seriously, and caused extensive damage to houses, schools and some government offices.</p>

<p>CHINA SCHOOL STAMPEDE KILLS 8</p>
<p>BEIJING - Eight children died and 26 were injured in a stampede in a school stairwell in central China, local media reported today.</p>
<p>Students at the Yucai Middle School in Hunan province were leaving their classrooms after evening study on Monday when one tripped, setting off a deadly crush, the official Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>Students at the school in Xiangxiang city were crowding the stairs, reluctant to step into heavy rain outside, state radio news reported.</p>
<p>Officials there told Xinhua the dead included seven boys and a girl aged from 11 to 14. Of the 26 injured, five were seriously hurt, said the report.</p>
<p>Thousands of people die in work, traffic and school accidents across China every year. But in a country where the government enforces a one-child policy in cities, the deaths of children can unleash especially volatile anger, often directed at officials.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Nancy Kosik's etiquette classes have become more complicated.</p>
<p>The Montreal-based consultant offers workshops in etiquette and protocol for students, business executives and politicians, at home as well as Ottawa.</p>
<p>Among the basics to be mastered is the handshake, the age-old ritual for meeting, greeting, parting, thanking and congratulating.</p>
<p>These days, fears of contracting the H1N1 influenza virus have many people squirming, recoiling, nodding and waving -- anything to avoid shaking hands.</p>
<p>Kosik said she understands their concerns. She makes hand-sanitizing dispensers available at all her classes. She keeps miniature bottles in her coat, her purse, in the car and at home.</p>
<p>Kosik said she lauds all the new-found attention being paid to hygiene. But it's bad manners to refuse an extended hand without offering an adequate excuse. And in most situations, a wave or a nod or a fistbump is not an adequate equivalent.</p>
<p>"In so many social and business situations, handshaking is extremely important. It's a way of showing respect, of saying it's a pleasure or an honour to meet you."</p>
<p>Refusing to shake hands, she said, might be construed as a sign of disinterest, insensitivity or discomfort. Indeed, the handshake is such a powerful symbol that the first to proffer his or her hand subconsciously assumes the leadership role in even the briefest interaction, Kosik said.</p>
<p>But what to do if you've been coughing and hacking, or if the other person shows signs of sniffling and snorting, or if you know someone's hygiene is subpar?</p>
<p>Kosik's advice is to acknowledge the non-handshaking right off the bat. Say something like: "I'd love to shake hands, but I think I'm coming down with something. I don't want to put you at risk."</p>
<p>Or try this: "I see you're a little stuffed up and my immune system is a little weak. Sorry if I don't shake hands."</p>
<p>Say it even if it's a little white lie, she counselled. "In proper etiquette, you never make others feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p>But what if it's the boss or an important client and the handshake is unavoidable? Shake hands, then get out the hand sanitizer as soon as you're out of sight.</p>

<p>Premier Jean Charest was vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus in his hometown of Sherbrooke yesterday morning, after picking up a voucher on Friday.</p>
<p>Charest said he hoped to set an example and urged the general population to get vaccinated before the holiday period. As of Thursday night, 3,327,117 people had been vaccinated, about 43.2 per cent of the overall population.</p>
<p>Quebec's Public Health Department hopes that at least 60 per cent of the public gets the flu shot.</p>
<p>Charest said it's important for Quebecers to get vaccinated even though the flu has not resulted in many deaths.</p>
<p>To date, 2,409 people have been hospitalized with flu symptoms, and 342 were treated in intensive-care units. A total of 72 Quebecers died.</p>
<p>The second wave of the flu, which began in late October, has peaked, public health officials have said. However, a third wave, expected in March or April, could be more dangerous.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>In a flash, street theatre can win an audience; What started as the Internet phenomenon of the flash mob in 2003 has morphed into the latest trend in improvisational theatrics</b>
</div><div>Peter Birnie   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>1081 words</div><div>7 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>D5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Late in October, dozens of people showed up downtown in Vancouver dressed as ghouls, twitching in unison as they joined a worldwide Halloween tribute to Michael Jackson and his seminal Thriller video. The "flash mob" has morphed from an amorphous gathering of people for no real purpose into something more -- street theatre for the era of electronic social networking.</p>
<p>Legend has it that the first flash mob gathered in June of 2003 at the rug department of <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> in Manhattan, 100 people pretending to look for a "love rug" for their communal home in a warehouse. Many mobs later, what was just a cute excuse to get together with friends and strangers alike is becoming some must-see stuff.</p>
<p>This instant form of improvisational theatre is catching on everywhere as tools such as Twitter take off in popularity; with hundreds of millions of potential recruiters signed on to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and MySpace and other social networks, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> is now filled with video documents of the fun to be had when ordinary spaces are made magical, if only for a moment, by collective strange behaviour.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Deutsche Telekom</span>'s T-Mobile took note last year and, in a brilliant marketing move, began planning "spontaneous" events. Early in the new year, London's Liverpool Street Station saw dozens of dancers take part in a guerrilla routine to a pastiche of tunes broadcast in the station's main hall.</p>
<p>Weeks later, the T-Mobile stunt was mimicked when more than 10,000 people responded to a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page named Liverpool Street Station Silent Dance, travelling from all over the U.K. to dance to music on their headphones. Or try to, anyway -- police closed the station for 90 minutes as the mob grew so big that no one could move.</p>
<p>T-Mobile asked Londoners to show up in Trafalgar Square to sing a song, and hundreds of wireless microphones were handed out so 13,500 people could belt Hey Jude. Not long after at Central Station in Antwerp, Belgians were treated to 200 dancers having fun with Do Re Mi from The Sound of Music, and a copycat event to the same tune soon took place at the railway station in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Hats off to New York, however, for taking the concept to a joyously anarchic level. Improv Everywhere is a loose-knit organization of like-minded souls who concoct increasingly strange events that not only fly in the face of normalcy, but do it with a kind of kindness worth noting.</p>
<p>In 2004, for instance, Improv Everywhere searched for a struggling rock band performing a small gig at an awkward time, with little potential for an audience. What the group dubs its "agents" would then flood the venue and give the band its "Best Gig Ever."</p>
<p>The degree of research was commendable. At the Mercury Lounge on a Sunday night, Vermont's Ghosts of Pasha were on their first tour. About 40 "agents" gathered at a nearby watering hole while a scout confirmed that the band was indeed facing the prospect of zero audience.</p>
<p>Enter Improv Everywhere, and suddenly Ghosts of Pasha get an enthusiastic crowd roaring its approval. The agents weren't there to mock the band, and went to great lengths to simply give the guys a great evening.</p>
<p>Something similar happened in California, where IE showed up at an ordinary Little League baseball game to make it the "Best Game Ever." No slouches, those IE agents, as they placed popcorn hawkers and plenty of fans in otherwise empty stands, a TV crew with a Jumbotron and live commentary just off the field, popcorn hawkers and, best of all, no less than the Goodyear Blimp floating overhead, flashing the team names.</p>
<p>Endlessly clever, IE does its best work in New York. It has gathered hundreds of pairs of twins in matching outfits to sit on the subway opposite each other (Human Mirror), given newlyweds at City Hall a surprise wedding reception and strung 700 people with camera flash attachments across the Brooklyn Bridge for a night light show.</p>

At Madison Square Garden, it had a whole section of fans at a Knicks game fooled in a "Where's Waldo?"-style search for a guy named Rob, with everyone shouting Rob's name.</p>

<p>Improv Everywhere founder Charlie Todd is a tireless organizer, not only for his gang but groups popping up all over. The Urban Prankster Network he helped found has chapters all over the planet, including one in Vancouver.</p>
<p>With fewer than 100 members, Vanguard: Vancouver Group for the Unity of the Artistically Rambunctious and Deranged doesn't have the critical mass needed to flood a Canada Line car with hundreds of people who will proceed to take their pants off -- an annual IE tradition in New York. A Vanguard video features just one hapless agent trying to chat up the leather-bedecked dummies in a sex shop window, and a "freeze" that took place at Robson and Burrard drew only about 15 people to stand motionless.</p>
<p>There's no faulting Vanguard's ambitions, however, as a lively forum offers great debate on ideas to try. Speaking of the Canada Line, a hot topic for Vanguard agents is the "escalator high-five" (gaining popularity across the Urban Prankster Network) that has commuters being invited to high-five on the ride up.</p>
<p>Since the high fever of H1N1 paranoia remains rampant, that might be an idea to put on hold for now.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Risks with HPV vaccine are real</b>
</div><div>Connie Howard   </div>

<p>Re:Cervical cancer survivor urges young girls to get HPV shot, The Journal Dec. 3</p>
<p>As with H1N1, stories like this one, urging vaccination, are considered fair and balanced, while pieces about the risks of vaccination are almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Rarely do we see major stories featuring opposing voices, even when they are as prominent as that of ABC's Chief Medical Editor Dr. Timothy Johnson, who, writing about Gardasil, said that for the first time in his career he "cannot recommend a vaccine for its intended population-- in this case, young girls."</p>
<p>He recommended parents read an August editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association before they decide. The editorial he referred to points out that while HPV is present in most cases of cervical cancer, it is only one of many causes, and that prevention is much more complicated than this vaccine--there are more than 100 different types of HPV, and at least 15 of them are cancer-causing. Current vaccines target only two of the cancer-causing strains.</p>
<p>The editorial also points out that the relationship between infection at a young age and development of cancer 20 to 40 years later is not known, and that HPV does not appear to be very harmful because almost all HPV infections are cleared by the immune system.</p>
<p>Dr. Scott Ratner, whose teenage daughter became very ill with autoimmune disease (myofasciitis) following her first Gardasil shot, told CBS his daughter was so ill with the neurological problem "...she'd have been better off getting cervical cancer than the vaccination."</p>
<p>Dr. Diane Harper, speaking at the 4th International Public Conference on Vaccination in Virginia in October, reminded her audience that incidence of cervical cancer in the developed world is low, that four out of five women with cervical cancer are in developing countries, that there have been no efficacy trials in girls under 15 years, and that the rate of serious adverse events is a major concern. The reason for her honesty, she said, is that she needs to be able to sleep at night.</p>
<p>We need more scientists, editors and publishers who value their integrity this much.</p>
<p>The manufacturer continues to repeat that reported adverse reactions haven't been proven linked to the vaccine, but parents of the young women harmed need no proof-- they know their daughters were well prior to their shots, and quickly become unwell following their shots. And though these events do occur at a low background rate apart from vaccines, the number correlated with the shot is alarming.</p>
<p>I understand that the risks with the vaccine, as with cervical cancer, are small. But they're very real, and they happen now. And they happen to young girls not even yet sexually active, in the hopes we might prevent cervical cancer two or three decades from now.</p>
<p>Some of the reactions are permanently debilitating or fatal.</p>
<p>This is information parents ought to have alongside pieces about those urging the shot. D r. Romanowski says too many families are hesitating. Maybe they're doing so with good reason.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Christmas rush draws mixed reviews; Some retailers ecstatic, others find sales slow</b>
</div><div>Sarah McGinnis   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>846 words</div><div>7 December 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>

<p>H eading into her third Christmas season, Pages bookstore co-owner Simone Lee is relieved to see patrons scooping up armloads of books at her Kensington shop.</p>
<p>It's a fabulous year for books with most of the biggest authors having released new titles just in time for the holidays, she explains.</p>
<p>But Lee knows the faltering global economy can keep even the most devoted book lovers away.</p>
<p>"I took over the store two years ago. The first Christmas we had parity with the American dollar. The second year was the end of the world(economically speaking). This year, will it be the Christmas the swine flu ate?" wondered Lee.</p>
<p>This past weekend marked the beginning of the Christmas rush for many retailers who depend on holiday purchases to push them into profitability for the year.</p>
<p>And although the economic outlook has improved since stock markets plummeted a year ago, many shoppers are still holding tight to their cash.</p>
<p>A recent RBC survey of 1,018 Canadians showed nearly half of respondents, including 51 per cent of Albertans, planned to pull back on Christmas spending this year.</p>
<p>Part of this movement to spend less on gifts could be tied to the uncertain job market.</p>
<p>According to the same RBC survey, Albertans have the highest anxiety in all of Canada over potentially being laid off, with 36 per cent of respondents here fearing the pink slip, compared to 27 per cent nationwide.</p>
<p>Those concerns seemed to be confirmed last week when <span class="companylink">Talisman Energy</span> announced it was cutting 220 positions, primarily in Calgary.</p>
<p>In an effort to cut back on Christmas spending, Beth Caron and her family have decided to move away from store-bought gifts to making presents for each other. But the process is taking more time than she imagined.</p>
<p>"To buy one big item is easier. When you have to make a nice little homemade thing, it takes longer," Caron said.</p>
<p>Shawn Sutherland has trimmed his gift budget by 25 per cent over the past year and acknowledged on Saturday he was hitting the malls earlier than usual to try to make the most of the money he will spend on presents.</p>
<p>Jeanie Allison polished off the last of her Christmas shopping at Market Mall on Saturday and said she was definitely checking price tags this year.</p>
<p>"I tried to be more careful. I always try to be mindful of what I'm buying for people. But this year I was trying to keep to a budget," Allison said.</p>
<p>At Market Mall, visitor traffic has appeared lower this winter, and there has been a definite difference in overall shopping patterns, said Cathy Hancock, manager of Quilts Etc.</p>
<p>"Shoppers are doing a lot more looking. They're doing their homework and coming in and doing price checks. They come in, they look, they leave. They come in, they look, they leave. It's the third visit in before they commit," said Hancock, adding her business has fared well so far this year.</p>
<p>The first weekend in December is traditionally the third biggest sales weekend of the year, second only to the two later weekends leading into Christmas, said Mappins Jewellers district manager Gabrielle Allen.</p>
<p>She agrees many of the people coming in to shop for major purchases such as engagement and wedding rings have already done considerable homework online and shopped around before they're willing to make a purchase.</p>
<p>"It's the new reality. There's a lot more research done before they come to us. Now the consumer is much more educated about the purchase of a once-in-a-lifetime item," she said.</p>
<p>The blast of winter weather certainly isn't helping sales, said Smart Set manager Leanne Scott, who acknowledged Market Mall was pretty empty until lunchtime on Saturday.</p>
<p>Not all retailers are hurting this holiday season.</p>
<p>Pusch manager Asiah Cedeno says her sales continue to be strong even with designer denim costing$400 a pair or more.</p>
<p>"There's no recession in fashion," said Cedeno.</p>
<p>Edward Cavell has coowned Livingstone and Cavell Extraordinary Toys for 17 years and said this is his best sales year ever.</p>
<p>Despite Saturday's snow-covered roads, his whimsical shop is filled with people testing out toys and ringing up purchases.</p>
<p>The store met its sales targets even during the height of Friday's storm, he said.</p>
<p>"Business has consistently been great all year. We've had good solid traffic, and people have been buying across the board from inexpensive stocking stuffers to fairly significant collector items," said Cavell.</p>
<p>"We've been around long enough that we have a whole generation of young parents that have grown up with our toys and are looking for them for their child."</p>

<p>Our 40-year-old toilet recently gave out. We got a new one. During the installation the plumber mentioned that he went, once a week, to the local golf club to replace their broken toilet-flusher handles. Once every week!</p>
<p>“That seems excessive,” I said. I couldn't imagine why golfers would be so hard on toilet handles. Hadn't my grandmother managed to hold onto the same one for at least 60 years? Maybe this plumber was using cheap plastic replacements to ensure he had a job for life.</p>
<p>But it wasn't cheap plastic or boorish golfers making the career of this plumber. It turns out that I'm the last person to realize it's more sanitary to flush the handle with your foot instead of touching it with your hands. I'm sure it is. I just wish I'd figured that out a lot sooner.</p>
<p>Germs. These days everyone is thinking about them. Two years ago I couldn't have told you what Purell was for, but now all my friends are armed with squirt bottles of this antibacterial mace. And since the onset of H1N1, the hospital where I am a regular visitor has sprouted hand-sanitizer dispensers at every doorway.</p>
<p>Sanitizing the hands seems like a good idea, so I joined in and gave mine the odd shot of gel, especially if I thought any nurses were looking my way. Little by little I succumbed to the propaganda that the hospital, or the world even, is awash in germs looking to kill me outright or at least hitch a ride on me. I began to press the elevator button with my knuckle, the ring-finger knuckle of my left hand, which isn't much involved in my daily affairs.</p>
<p>I shared one such elevator ride with a member of the hospital cleaning staff who was pushing a three-level trolley of bagged, reeking laundry. He was suitably gloved, therefore well protected from all the stuff he had just packed up. “Let me press the elevator button for you because I am wearing rubber gloves,” he said.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said, and as I exited the building, I squirted again as advised.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to me that the bacterial count on the rubber gloves that man was wearing must have been off the charts. My ordinary bare hands were as good as boiled and irradiated in comparison to his button-pressing, door-holding, handle-turning, getting-a-chocolate-bar-out-of-the-snack-machine and worn-for-eight-hours-straight rubber gloves. Since that day I have had my doubts about the rubber-glove solution to germ transmission.</p>
<p>I predict that rubber gloves will cause the next noteworthy plague. Have you not seen the gloved sandwich maker in the coffee shop fishing in her pocket for a tissue while making your sandwich? After pouring the coffee and touching every machine in the place, she helpfully takes your money at the cash register too. The places those rubber gloves have been are the same places where bare hands used to go, except hands were washed once in a while.</p>
<p>My worst rubber-glove fears arise at the dentist's office, an apparently spotless and high-tech place. My hygienist, the officious high-energy type, puts on fresh (I hope) gloves and begins to poke around in my mouth. Oops. She has to adjust the lamp and pull the tray closer. Hands back into my mouth. Just has to write something down. Hands into my mouth again. Leaves the room to take X-rays. Hands back into my mouth. Goes to put in her pizza order, then talk with the receptionist. More notes, more tray and lamp adjustments, then hands into my mouth again. What do you call those people who carry a disease but never get it?</p>
<p>I begin to count the number of times she grabs the underside of her chair to pull it closer. I think of all the patients who have gone before me and all those weeks of chair adjustment, immediately followed by all those open mouths ready to receive the bacteria of previous patients. Why don't I just start smoking other people's cigarette butts, or licking door knobs? Why bother to wash my hands when my own mouth is a sewer?</p>
<p>I recall the 40 years I spent with my previous low-tech dentist. His assistant disinfected the room between patients and prepared his equipment just so. He read the chart, then washed his hands with soap and began. If he left the room he would rewash on the way in. I suppose soap doesn't do the job of rubber gloves, but rubber gloves these days are too well-travelled for my taste.</p>
<p>To compound matters, my new dentist insists I must come back every three months to maintain good dental hygiene. I calculate that if I do I will be twice as likely to contract whatever disease is lurking under the edge of that chair.</p>
<p>So, in self-defence, I have taken to wearing gloves wherever I go – not rubber gloves, but my old leather gloves. I keep them on when visiting hospitals, pumping gas or playing fetch with the dog, but I never make sandwiches wearing them, nor do I stick them into anyone's mouth. That would be unsanitary. And when I finally get back home after a long day of germ collection, I take my gloves off and wash my hands with soap. That (plus a flu shot just in case) is good enough for me.</p>

</div><div>Robert Cribb   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1972 words</div><div>7 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Justin Rizek's hockey career is over.</p>
<p>He is 13.</p>
<p>After four concussions over the past two seasons in the Greater Toronto Hockey League, he has decided to hang up his skates out of fear.</p>
<p>"These days, kids are trying to kill each other," he says. "I was scared."</p>
<p>The first few times the eighth grader's skull was smacked against the glass, he saw stars. On a couple of occasions back on the bench, he threw up.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the 4-foot-11, 95-pound centre would take a break for a few days or weeks to heal before returning to the game he loved.</p>
<p>Then, in August, a fourth and final hit sent his head ricocheting against the ice. He blacked out. Eventually, he got to the bench in a dizzying fog.</p>
<p>"It feels like your brain jiggles in your head," recalls the former minor bantam AA Etobicoke Canuck.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream. You're in space and can't think."</p>
<p>His mother Lori-Anne would later say he appeared "delusional."</p>
<p>While she knows her son loves hockey - always the first on the ice and the last to come off - she now calls the sport "vicious."</p>
<p>"We were told (the concussions) could affect him for the rest of his life."</p>
<p>The head has captured the heart of the hockey world.</p>
<p>Cringe-inducing head shots at the junior and professional levels are triggering vigorous debate about hockey violence and its impacts on adult skulls.</p>
<p>But data obtained by the Star show youth hockey is also struggling to contain ferocious head hits that threaten hockey's most vulnerable brains.</p>
<p>There were more than 400 penalties last year for serious checks to the head in the GTHL that warranted a minor-plus-10-minute penalty. That's double from one year earlier.</p>
<p>Add to that another 71 checking-to-the-head penalties that triggered major penalties plus a suspension and two more head-checking incidents that prompted league investigations.</p>
<p>A penalty related to head injuries - "checking from behind" - was assessed more than 2,300 times last year, far beyond any other offence. The previous year, officials called the penalty more than 3,000 times.</p>
<p>"The magnitude of the problem shown by that data is more than I had anticipated even though I see these kids every week in my office," says Dr. Charles Tator, a Toronto brain surgeon who has specialized in hockey-related head injuries.</p>
<p>"The sheer number of times kids are hitting each other to the head really bothers me."</p>
<p>No one is sure how many players in the GTHL - the biggest competitive minor hockey league in the world with more than 500 teams and 8,000 players - suffer serious injuries because of all of those head shots.</p>
<p>The league requires concussed players to submit a physician's letter clearing them to play before they return to the ice. Two years ago, 51 such letters were filed with the league. Last year there were 55. There have been 22 so far this season.</p>
<p>But those cases are likely the tip of the iceberg, league officials admit, because so many go unreported or undiagnosed.</p>
<p>Anne Hunt, who managed last season's North York Knights minor peewee AA team in the GTHL, said seven players on her team of 11-year-olds - nearly half the team - suffered medically confirmed concussions.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt some kids are out to hurt somebody," said the occupational therapist.</p>
<p>The story is the same with the Etobicoke Canucks organization, where two 13-year-olds have been told by doctors never to play hockey again. Another is waiting to hear if he'll ever return.</p>
<p>An 11-year-old Canuck is just back from concussion and two 12-year-olds and two 14-year-olds are also out with concussions.</p>
<p>"It's cutthroat beyond anything I've seen before," said Canucks general manager Elinor Gillespie, who has been in minor hockey for 28 years.</p>
<p>"I've had more kids going down from concussions than from H1N1. There is no respect anywhere now. If their kids are not getting enough ice time, their parents will do anything to destroy whoever they deem to be in the way of their getting what they want - coaches, whomever. It's scary."</p>
<p>In a GTHL survey of 62 elite under-17 players last season, four indicated they suffered concussions or head injuries caused by either a "hit to the head" or a "hit from behind." GTHL president John Gardner says league officials are responding vigilantly to dangerous hits to the head.</p>
<p>"If a player is seriously hurt as a result of a serious penalty, that player has to sit out as long as the player he injured. It's been done."</p>
<p>But some question whether it is being done enough.</p>
<p>Corey Noyek, an 18-year-old who ended up in hospital twice after suffering serious concussions as a GTHL player, says his aggressors got off easy.</p>
<p>In one case, he was hit from behind at the blue line. "I went into the boards head first. I was light-headed and disoriented ... nauseated and traumatized and saw stars," the lean, 5-foot-9 defenceman recalls.</p>
<p>The checker got a four-minute penalty.</p>
<p>"I was out for a month or two," Noyek says. "I had post-concussion syndrome and was feeling like I was on drugs for a couple of months. I would be sitting in class and was dazed out. ... I was traumatized."</p>
<p>His father, Steven Noyek, a long-time coach in the GTHL, said his son was one of five players on the team that year who suffered a concussion.</p>
<p>He believes the GTHL's typical four-game suspension for major hits from behind or to the head is insufficient.</p>
<p>In the Ontario Hockey League, such infractions draw a five-minute major, game misconduct and an automatic review by the league.</p>
<p>"I think you should get 18 games (half a season) for the first hit (to the head) and the second hit, you are gone," says Noyek. "A few kids may sit out a year but you will save a lot of kids from a lot of problems."</p>
<p>Even some on-ice officials would like to see the league levy longer suspensions.</p>
<p>Veteran referee Nick Mintsopoulos watched a 15-year-old Don Mills Flyer slam a Mississauga Rep "violently into the boards."</p>
<p>The teen lay motionless on the ice for nearly a half-hour before being removed on a stretcher by ambulance staff in November 2008.</p>
<p>On a violence scale of 10, this was a 9, Mintsopoulos wrote in his incident report.</p>
<p>"I was contemplating calling the game," he recalls. "Seeing a kid leave the ice on a stretcher not knowing what will happen is pretty scary. You just think, 'That was someone's son that just got hit from behind.' It's life-changing."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the player's father seemed less concerned when he came on to the ice to check his son.</p>
<p>"As (the player) was on a stretcher and leaving the ice, his dad said, 'He'll be ready for the third period.' I said 'What?' I couldn't believe it. It was just weird."</p>
<p>The Flyers player received the minimum four-game suspension for the incident.</p>
<p>"That kid could be out for a season while the kid that put him out may only be out for two weeks tops," says Mintsopoulos, who manages game officials for the Mississauga Hockey League as well as refereeing GTHL games.</p>
<p>Sports injury researcher Dr. Bill Montelpare says hockey is far too lenient when it comes to head violence.</p>
<p>"We've been destroying hockey because we allow this stupidity. It's a culture problem. You have to teach the coaches how to teach the game properly, that head hits aren't allowed and that when people get concussed, they're going to be affected for life."</p>
<p>Neuroscientists agree the still-developing brain of a teen is more susceptible to trauma than the adult brain, making the long-term risk of head hits even more serious at the minor hockey level, says Tator, who has given seminars to GTHL coaches on reducing head shots.</p>
<p>"Seeing that volume of penalties makes me feel that we should be doing more on the prevention side. We have to change the culture so that hits to the head and hitting from behind are not only not tolerated but aren't part of the game."</p>
<p>A Star review of 122 of last season's most serious infractions - those that triggered a league investigation - reveals several stories of brutal hits to young heads.</p>
<p>In one case, mere seconds after the puck dropped in a game of 16-year-olds last January, everything stopped.</p>
<p>A Toronto Eagle, pressing the Vaughan Rangers in the first round-the-boards puck chase of the game, checked an unsuspecting opponent "violently head first into the boards," says the GTHL report into the incident. "There was no opportunity for the Vaughan player to defend himself and the force of the impact was serious enough to have caused significant and permanent injury."</p>
<p>The Ranger lay motionless for several seconds.</p>
<p>"All the parents did that gasp," recalls Todd Clark, the referee who worked the game and has the image still burned in his mind. "Then, it's quiet. Everyone was thinking, 'My God, this kid might have just died.'"</p>
<p>Clark feared the teen's neck had been broken. "He was crushed into the boards. There was no reason for that degree of violence, especially that early in the game."</p>
<p>The Ranger player was eventually assisted off the ice by teammates and taken to hospital.</p>
<p>The checker had amassed 10 checking-from-behind penalties since 2001 and 18 major penalties overall during that time. He was suspended for four games and put on probation which signals that a similar incident in future will trigger a more lengthy suspension.</p>
<p>Such penalties pale in comparison with the lasting injuries that can be caused by head hits.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Echlin, a sports medicine physician in London, Ont., studies head shots in hockey.</p>
<p>"People who deny concussions in hockey should come spend the day in my office and see kids and their parents suffering in silence.</p>
<p>"There can be a constant inability to function in life - inability to get out of bed, exercise, inability to go to school and sit in a classroom, inability to bear bright light, constant headaches. It's horrible."</p>
<p>Lucas Hauer knows that horror.</p>
<p>"I have a very bad short-term memory now," says the 18-year-old Hauer who suffered two concussions as a GTHL player. He missed three months of school and remains in physiotherapy two years after he stopped playing hockey.</p>
<p>"I had an overall fogginess, balance problems and sometimes my head spins when I close my eyes. ... I wish I would have broken my arm, my leg or even my femur - something that would heal."</p>

<p>"The player with the cleanest fingernails goes first."</p>
<p>That's the first rule in Scabs and Guts, a new board game about the human body.</p>
<p>In these swine flu-fearing days of excessive hand washing, Scabs and Guts is an entertaining and educational way to get the entire family thinking about hygiene.</p>
<p>Players travel around a body-shaped board and are given multiple choice questions to answer with each turn. There are three categories: Scrapes and Scabs, Blood and Guts and Blubber and Bluff. Wild cards have players acting out situations such as: "Show how you react to receiving a flu shot!"</p>
<p>Scabs and Guts is simple, informative and a little bit gross. It inspires discussion about ... well, all kinds of bodily functions.</p>
<p>Created for kids 6 and up, Scabs and Guts, $24.95, is available at Chapters Indigo, Mastermind Toys, Calendar Club Canada and Go! The Game Store.</p>

<p>IT'S ALSO THE LAST PLACE THE MISSUS WOULD LOOK "The fish don't know who I am." -- Billionaire golfer Tiger Woods, whose many hobbies include scuba diving.</p>
<p>WE'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH "For a fun, casual look, fur trim on a flat boot looks great with leggings and a winter-white jacket. A fur hat could be added for an extra dash of luxe. A good rule of thumb, though, is to stick to one fur piece, perhaps two if it's on accessories." -- Canwest News Service reporter Marta Gold, passing along some fashion tips from Edmonton stylist Emily Salsbury.</p>
<p>THAT'S WHAT OUR DOCTOR'S BEEN TELLING US ALL ALONG "There was never any evidence, not from Day 1, and not anytime since, that this strain of flu (H1N1) was going to be a particularly dangerous strain, either in terms of its capacity to make people sick or its capacity to kill people." -- Philip Alcabes, associate professor in urban public health at the School of Health Sciences, Hunter College, City University of New York.</p>
<p>IT'S ALL GREEK TO US "Hao jiu bu jian." -- Unnamed Chinese official, who suggested, tongue in cheek, that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper would be greeted in China with a phrase that translates into "Long time no see."</p>
<p>WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE "For councillors Wade Murray and Terry Hincks to walk out during (Lee) Harding's presentation was very rude and childish. Also, Hincks' comments about 'having no respect for that organization whatsoever' shows his complete disregard for freedom of speech and democracy." -- Donna Khan, in a letter to the editor, taking these two city councillors to task for their loutish behaviour when Lee Harding, of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, expressed concern over a $50,000 raise given to city manager Glen Davies, whose base salary has gone from $200,000 a year to $250,000.</p>
<p>THERE SEEMS TO BE A THEME DEVELOPING "To Glen Davies, I say: You played the game well, but shame on you." -- Norman Osborne, in a letter to the editor.</p>
<p>WE LOVE A CHALLENGE "They've got everything working in their favour. If they can't do it this year, then give up on the revolution, boys." -- Security intelligence specialist Tom Quiggin, drawing attention to the fact that, given the Winter Olympics and then the summer summit meetings of both the Group of Eight and G20, the year 2010 could be a pivotal one for activists in Canada.</p>
<p>IT CERTAINLY MAKES FOR BETTER NEWS COPY "I would much prefer that than people who are sitting there in a sissified atmosphere pretending there's nothing happening." -- Provincial NDP leader Dwain Lingenfelter, commenting on a session in the legislature that was characterized by passionate debate punctuated now and then with some equally enthusiastic name-calling.</p>
<p>WE KNOW THE FEELING "I'm not the guy sitting by the fireplace with a glass of red wine thinking, 'My work is beloved by hundreds of thousands of people.' I'm the guy sitting at the desk staring at the (computer) screen thinking, 'This story isn't good enough. Please God, make it better, I've got to make it better." -- Humourist Stuart McLean, author of the Vinyl Cafe series.</p>
<p>AMEN "The disappointment of this loss is going to last for each of us for as long as we are on the planet."-- Saskatchewan Roughriders head coach Ken Miller, in the gloomy aftermath of a Grey Cup game his team lost 28-27 to the Montreal Alouettes in the final seconds when ... oh, never mind, it's too depressing.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to come face to face with a gigantic protozoa?</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Science Centre's latest exhibit, Germs! Germs! Germs!, is a full-sized glimpse into the world of microorganisms from A to Z -- or at least from bacteria to yeast. The exhibit offers a glimpse into the microscopic world of viruses, bacteria and mould, and includes a brief passage through an intestine.</p>
<p>Keir Glazier, human physiologist and sports scientist at the Science Centre, said the travelling exhibit is especially relevant right now, particularly given recent concern over H1N1. "It's perfect timing right now," he said. "H1N1 is a very hot topic."</p>
<p>Glazier said the exhibit is also intended to dispel some of the fears and myths about germs.</p>
<p>He notes his personal favourite microorganism, yeast, is necessary to make bread, beer and wine. "Not all germs are bad," he says.</p>
<p>The exhibit is travelling throughout Canada in the next five years, and will remain on display in Regina until Jan. 10.</p>

</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed (it's only been five years, take your time) your social gal does try her darndest to present each week's events in a unique, fun-filled fashion. i.e.: themes, alliteration 'til the cows come home, every possible Oxford adjective and yes, an event-centric language that even Gazette publisher/editor in chief Alan Allnutt dubbed Jennese. What can/will she do for an encore? How about plain tell the whole social story, guts and all, for your naughty notie pleasure?</p>
<p>St. Mary's '70s Splash: It all started on a snug Thursday eve when I realized that instead of some much needed nesting, St. Mary's 72nd ball beckoned. So I donned the requisite sartorials and hopped a cab to Windsor Station.</p>
<p>Upon entering, my not-so-spirited spirits were immediately lifted as I spotted every social columnist's off- night best friend: the champagne flute. I quickly downed several and suddenly the night looked a whole lot brighter.</p>
<p>It was at this particular moment that I went bumping (chicly) into several esteemed guests worthy of this newfound Jenergy. They included Della and Tony Meti (molto cool couple, but Italyspeak was last week's shtick, so enuff of that); community-minded Carolyn and Rick Renaud (column regulars cuz clearly they should be); Lise Champagne-Bastien and CTV Montreal senior VP/GM Don Bastien (yes, I want my own show, Don, and if this mention helps, so be it); Patricia (Wonder Doc) Portoluzzi with husband Jeffrey (Mogulman) Speak (representing that new breed of "you can't keep up with them power pairs, so don't try"); and speaking of the power-ful, what good party would be complete without Claire and Peter Kruyt. Claire, off (heck, on) the record, Mark Smith was right - your bijoux rocked).</p>
<p>Re tail tawk: It was the usual ("how's biz?" "how'r the kids?" "how dyu stay so thin?") peppered with lotsa en vogue H1N1 air kissing and serious silent auction gawking. (Lots were impressive, think Oahu wow and cat ski chic).</p>
<p>Next we moved on to the dining room (disco décor by Bridget Fetterly dazzled) where I took my seat between the dashing duo of Adam Turner (attending with wife Catherine) and Leonard Rossy (with wife Olga Assaly), who spent a good chunk of the night goodnaturedly questioning when my "work" would kick in (Leonard, it just did. Enjoy). Also adding to the tablescape: lawyer-lovely Anne-Marie Boucher, on scene with hub Mitch Garber, master of you know which game! What next? Waddya think?!</p>
<p>You're deep in Social Notes territory where schmoozing (nonstop and powerful); boozing (whatever you</p>
<p>fancied); dining (chef Alain Pignard's best); dancing (1945 and the Boogie Wonder Band, 'nuff said); prancing (catwalk ready); and raffling (for tropic-exotics)</p>
<p>are what we do best. This boogie baby (clearly) was</p>
<p>no exception. In fact, it was ex-cep-tional, thanks in large part to co-chairpeeps Tracy and Marc Bibeau, who (with invaluable support from the centre's board chairperson Marc Trottier, attending with wife Marisa, and many others pictured today) helped raise the bash bar, along with a record-breaking $1.57 million toward the creation of the first McGill Chair in Family and Community Medicine Research at St. Mary's.</p>
<p>Did I miss anything? Of course, I did. Penning this column is like trying to fit the world's population into my apartment.</p>
<p>So, before we go, a quick nod to the stirring Small Wonder video; amazing rendition of Amazing Grace by Sylvie Desgroseilliers; and other notable boldables that contributed to the eve's psychedelic success, including Molson brothers Geoff and Andrew (attending with wives Kate and Helen respectively); Roshi and Baljit Chadha; a band of Broccolinis; Gwen and Tom Nacos; the hospital's top docs; Herbert Black, (whose dance moves were so flash even our Gaz photog couldn't catch 'em); and best cab buddies ever, Chantal and Mark Culver. 'Kay, we're good now, honestly.</p>
<p>Correction: Profound pologies to Robin Rosen who last week morphed into pal Selena Paperman, our oops!</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Come for the Frantics, stay for the bars; The Frantics, the four-man Canadian comedy institution, are marking 30 years together with an album release and a special show Monday at the Royal Theatre. Tickets are sold out, but troupe member Rick Green explains why you must be there anyhow</b>
</div><div>Rick Green   </div>
<div>Special to the Star</div>
<div>686 words</div><div>6 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The Toronto Star asked me to explain why The Frantics comedy troupe is performing at The Royal on Monday evening, and why anyone should attend.</p>
<p>Tough assignment. Even has me wondering if I should go. But I have to, because I am 1/4 of The Frantics.</p>
<p>You aren't 1/4 of The Frantics, unless your name is Peter Wildman, Paul Chato or Dan Redican. You're busy preparing for the heartwarming Boxing Day sales that are such a big part of your family's holiday tradition. You have long lists of things "to do," "to buy" and "to regift."</p>
<p>So all you need now is an even longer list, with reasons to come see us:</p>
<p>30 Reasons to Forgo</p>
<p>the Crowded, Noisy Mall</p>
<p>for The Frantics</p>
<p>(Cut this out and refer to it often)</p>
<p>1. There's nothing good on television. There never is, but it's worse with Hallmark specials such as The Christmas That Could've Almost Not Ever Been.</p>
<p>2. The Royal is beautiful. Ignore the lunacy on stage and marvel at this art-deco masterpiece.</p>
<p>3. Do a "pity laugh" and write off the evening as a "charitable donation."</p>
<p>4. Be immortalized as part of "The Laugh Track." Years from now tell your grandkids, "That guy snorting is me!"</p>
<p>5. There are lots of good bars on College St.</p>
<p>6. You're a fan of Mr. Canoehead or other Frantics characters. Especially if you haven't heard of them yet.</p>
<p>7. Shake off the funk of the Argos' season.</p>
<p>8. Shake off the funk of the Leafs' season.</p>
<p>9. Shake off the funk of David Miller's reign.</p>
<p>10. Everybody who is anybody will be there. As will a few people who are Somebody, Nobody, What's Her Name and that 'Guy From That Show.'</p>
<p>11. We will be performing highlights from our new album of songs - Frantic Noises, www.thefrantics[http://www.thefrantics] .com - so you could wear a recording device disguised as a hearing aid and make a pirate copy to give to friends. Or enemies.</p>
<p>12. Laughing produces less greenhouse gas than running a bulldozer. (No idea what that means.)</p>
<p>13. Your laughter sends a message to Prime Minister Stephen Harper. (No idea what that message is.)</p>
<p>14. "If you don't grin, the terrorists win."</p>
<p>15. A portion of every laugh will be sent to our troops.</p>
<p>16. Sketch comedy is a lost art. Learn why.</p>
<p>17. College streetcars are awesome. Many have a bar and sauna. Okay, that's not true, but a man can dream.</p>
<p>18. See Paul juggle knives.</p>
<p>19. See Dan eat his own foot.</p>
<p>20. See Peter leap nine streetcars on a moped.</p>
<p>21. See Rick apologize for lying about what you'd see.</p>
<p>22. Learn about the end of the world in 2012 as predicted by the Mayan calendar. (Also, learn why the Mayan calendar didn't predict the end of the Mayans.)</p>
<p>23. To tell me in person, "I saw your article in the Star. It didn't suck too badly."</p>
<p>24. Hear people talk for more than three minutes and not mention swine flu.</p>
<p>25. The Frantics shows are fun for the whole family. Especially families of weirdos.</p>
<p>26. The Frantics have been very influential. Their work has inspired many hopeful young comedians to get real jobs instead.</p>
<p>27. It is the social event of the season, next to Lady Teasdale's "December Bloom" Soiree at the Ritz.</p>
<p>28. A chance for "new Canadians" to immerse themselves in Canadian culture. (Scary stuff)</p>
<p>29. See a Toronto theatrical event in December that doesn't star Ross Petty ...</p>
<p>30. ... and is actually funny.</p>

<p>In another sign that the H1N1 pandemic is on the wane locally, Quebec health officials announced yesterday they are closing down the last seven of the flu clinics they had set up on the island of Montreal.</p>
<p>The clinics were set up to prevent Montrealers exhibiting symptoms of the virus from going to local emergency rooms and possibly infecting those around them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 15 vaccination centres on Montreal island remain open, and their hours of operation and location can be obtained at www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca[http://www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca]</p>

<p>Picture of kindness</p>
<p>My daughter and her friend were to work on a school project which called for taking pictures. I dropped them off downtown near the library to work on it.</p>
<p>The next day I asked to see the pictures and my daughter said that her friend had left the camera in the back of the car. We checked the whole car, and there was no camera.</p>
<p>We were headed downtown so we checked at the library. To our surprise, the camera had been left at the security desk -- everything intact! When my daughter's friend got out of the car, it must have dropped onto the street. It was amazing that it did not get run over. But even more amazing -- and wonderful -- was that someone had taken it into the library. My daughter uses her camera all the time, and it contained many pictures that are not replaceable.</p>
<p>We are truly grateful to whoever did this wonderful act of kindness.</p>
<p>-- Kim Boss</p>
<p>An angel named Karen</p>
<p>Recently, I decided to attend the H1N1 vaccination clinic at the University of Manitoba. As usual, there was an exceedingly long line of people. I use a cane to walk and can endure only a short time of walking or standing. A friend with me also has mobility issues. However, we decided to stay and wait since we probably wouldn't find a shorter line in the next little while.</p>
<p>Once inside the multi-purpose room, we were given a form to complete and were able to sit down at a table in order to do this. It took us a while to fill out the form and by then another long line had formed of people who had completed the required information and were waiting for the actual shots.</p>
<p>We were thinking that there was no way we would be able to stand in another line. The lady in front of us in the line outside said that we would be seen to right after her family had their vaccinations. She had talked with a person in charge and explained that we were behind them in line so we should be behind them in getting the shots as well.</p>
<p>This angel's name is Karen and what a wonderful thing she did. She demonstrated first-hand to her children the act of true kindness and caring. Due to her efforts we did not have to wait in another long line. She seemed to know and understand the hardship it was for us to do so and took it upon herself to lend a huge helping hand.</p>
<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Karen, for what you did. I will pay forward your act of kindness and pray that when you need someone to stand up for you, it will happen. May God bless you and your family!</p>

<p>We are from Churchill, a small town where everyone knows everyone else. We enjoy the small town life where doors are kept unlocked, and no one worries about crime.</p>
<p>On a trip to Winnipeg for medical reasons last year, my husband and I decided to stroll through Portage Place one afternoon. Later, our daughter called from home to say the lost and found staff at Portage Place were looking for us. We couldn't imagine why as we did not lose anything.</p>
<p>We made our way downtown for a second time that day to find out why they were trying to contact us. Turns out that my sometimes absent-minded husband had dropped his wallet in the mall. A kind-hearted person had picked it up and turned it in to the lost and found.</p>
<p>Not a thing was missing from the wallet. We asked if she had left a name, but she had not. All we know is that she is hearing impaired. I wondered aloud why she didn't leave her name, and the reply was, "They never do."</p>
<p>If you are reading this... thank you very much. We hear so many horror stories of Winnipeg but you, with your simple act of kindness, have restored our faith in the people of Winnipeg. God bless you.</p>

<p>11Gift-giving should be a gesture of love and appreciation, not an obligatory, stress-inducing ritual.</p>
<p>Gifts should create memories, not clutter and waste, and the most meaningful ones can't be found in a store.</p>
<p>But since this is the annual Detour holiday gift guide, none of that applies here.</p>
<p>Our admittedly shallow aim is to help last-minute shoppers think outside the box -- you know, so the gift inside the box isn't boring or lame.</p>
<p>Enjoy. And have a happy and meaningful holiday!</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>The hectic holiday season combined with unpredictable winter weather and many people sick with the flu means blood donations often drop this time of year.</p>
<p>The last two weeks of December are particularly lean for blood donations, said Canadian Blood Services spokesperson Veronica Magee.</p>
<p>"People are out busy shopping and maybe travelling too," Magee said.</p>
<p>And the recent H1N1 outbreak that is sickening many means more people are unable to give blood.</p>
<p>To help ensure a steady supply of blood for patients in need, Grand River Hospital, the Kitchener Rangers and Guelph Storm have joined the blood services' Partners for Life program, in which organizations pledge a certain number of donations a year.</p>
<p>Grand River is committed to 600 donations next year, and the Rangers and Storm 250 each.</p>
<p>Canadian Blood Services encourages organizations to sign up for the program because then they're more certain about being able to meet hospital orders with the expected supply.</p>
<p>"We know that we're pretty much guaranteed to get those collections," Magee said.</p>
<p>Grand River Hospital used in the past year 1,600 units of plasma, 1,300 units of platelets and 7,780 units of blood.</p>
<p>Across Canada, 78,000 blood donations are needed from the beginning of December to after New Year's Day. Waterloo's permanent clinic needs to collect 2,100 units.</p>
<p>So far the Waterloo location has collected 15,811 units toward their annual goal of 16,399. About 600 more appointments need to be filled before the holiday season wraps up in early January.</p>
<p>People need to wait two days to donate after getting a flu shot, either the H1N1 or seasonal flu vaccine. Those experiencing flu-like symptoms need to wait until they're feeling better. Anyone taking an anti-viral drug for preventive treatment can give blood if they're feeling OK.</p>
<p>Contact Canadian Blood Services at 1-888-236-6283 or go to blood.ca for more information about donating. The permanent Waterloo clinic at 94 Bridgeport Rd. E. has many hours available over the holidays. Call the toll-free number to book an appointment.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario remains far from its goal of vaccinating three-quarters of its population against H1N1, Ontario's top health official said Friday.</p>
<p>"To date about 30 per cent of the province's population has been immunized against H1N1," said Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"While that's good, I will tell you, quite frankly it's not good enough."</p>
<p>The target is to vaccinate 75 per cent of the population, and King said it's not fully known what degree of coverage a population needs to stop the spread of the flu.</p>
<p>"We are far from being in the clear. Many people are still susceptible," she said.</p>
<p>"The best way to prevent more cases of the flu is for everyone to roll up their sleeves and get the shot."</p>
<p>The numbers in the Guelph area are similar to the province's, up to 30 per cent or a little lower. Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health says if people are going to get immunized, now is a good time as there are still clinics set up in various communities.</p>
<p>"We have 15 community flu clinics scheduled before we move the clinics back to our office locations on Dec. 14," Lynn Beath, director of community health and disease prevention at Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, said in a press release. "If you haven't had your flu shots, plan to get them now. It's a busy time of year for people." Plus, the health unit notes that people can now get both the seasonal and H1N1 flu shots at the clinics.</p>
<p>King assured people Friday that the H1N1 vaccination was highly effective.</p>
<p>"I think people plan to be immunized and I trust people will make the right decision," she said.</p>

</div><div>McClatchy News Service</div>
<div>453 words</div><div>5 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>K3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The crowds, the fluorescent lights, the sales clerks who ignore you and the lines, lines, lines. Some people love Christmas shopping. They must also like sleeping on a bed of nails.</p>
<p>Here are 10 reasons to do your Christmas shopping online:</p>
<p>1. Unique gifts: You can find the coolest and most unusual stuff online. From remote-controlled Ferraris at hipstergifts.com to Gummi Army Guys at stupid.com, it's all out there. You just have to look. And as with all shopping, looking is half the fun.</p>
<p>2. Find exactly what you want: Need a Hello Kitty purse for your niece or a Transformer action figure for your nephew? The "toy of the year" may be sold-out early on toy sites, but check <span class="companylink">eBay</span> and you'll probably find it. Of course the <span class="companylink">eBay</span> price will be higher than retail on that hot item, but no one will be disappointed on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>3. Crowds: Not having to fight overzealous mobs is the very best part of shopping online. Plus, you can cook dinner while sitting at your computer.</p>
<p>4. Sleep in: Online shopping allows you to sleep in and leisurely stroll to your computer at a reasonable hour. Or better yet, you can shop after the kids are in bed.</p>
<p>5. Keep it secret: Have your gift-wrapped purchases delivered close to Christmas so you don't have to worry about hiding them from inquisitive little fingers or nosy spouses.</p>
<p>6. No germs: How many people ignore a cold and still go shopping, where they spread all those yucky germs? There's no chance of catching H1N1 from your computer.</p>
<p>7. No snarky clerks: Sure many of the clerks have a reason to be irritated -- shoppers can be nasty, aggressive and cheap -- and they know they'll likely be canned immediately after Christmas. Blessedly, there are no clerks online and, thus, no one to hassle you.</p>
<p>8. Dress code: You can shop online in your pajamas or sweat pants. Need I say more?</p>
<p>9. Better deals: Super hot deals offered by brick-and-mortar stores are picked off by the first 10 people in line. You can easily compare prices and find great deals online without the chance of being trampled.</p>
<p>10. Shipping: Have your gifts shipped directly to your home or to the recipient. If you like, online stores will even gift-wrap presents and slip in a personalized card. You'll reduce your holiday stress and avoid the lines at the post office. Many online stores offer free shipping.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fist bumps or handshakes?; Before you start making that list, checking it twice, signing your cards and buying gifts for your children's teachers, take etiquette expert</b>
</div><div>Julie Blais Comeau   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1320 words</div><div>5 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>J2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Julie Blais Comeau's holiday quiz. Give your gut responses for each of the scenarios, then read below to learn what to do for appropriate seasonal celebrating.</p>
<p>1 You exchange gifts with your best friend during a holiday drink. She presents you with a copy Julie and Julia. One of your colleagues gave you a copy the week before. You know your sister-in-law loved the movie. You simply change the tag and re-gift it.</p>
<p>Is re-gifting acceptable?</p>
<p>2 Your son's hockey coach gives you a holiday cheer invitation for Saturday night following your son's game. The invitation has you and your spouse's name on it.</p>
<p>Do you assume that children are invited?</p>
<p>3 January marks the one-year anniversary in your current position. Your boss is amazing, makes work fun and always has time for you. He is a wine connoisseur and an avid golfer. On the last day of work before your holiday break, you show your gratitude by offering a 2007 Mike Weir Pinot Noir. You feel good about your choice: You are encouraging Canadian winemakers and proceeds from the sale of the wine will go to the Mike Weir Foundation.</p>
<p>Is your gift appropriate?</p>
<p>4 It is Dec. 23 and after a long last day before your vacation, you click your garage door opener and pull up the driveway as your neighbour walks up to your car with gift in hand. She informs you that she and her family are leaving to spend the holidays on a beach in Cuba. You need not worry about their home as her brother and his girlfriend will be there to care for their dog and plants. She hands you the gift bag and offers you her best wishes. You thank her gratefully, wish her a wonderful trip, season's greeting and send her a thank you note without reciprocating a gift.</p>
<p>Is this a good-neighbour policy?</p>
<p>5 Financially, it has been a difficult year and you can't afford to give even a token gift to a</p>
<p>service provider.</p>
<p>Can you forgo gifts this year?</p>
<p>6 Your gift list for your children's teachers, day-care workers and coaches could make up a baker's dozen. This year you decide to be efficient and make the trip on your own to buy, in bulk, one gender-neutral gift in a variety of colours and styles. Your children will make personalized gift cards.</p>
<p>Is this a good strategy?</p>
<p>7 You kick off the holiday season with your family by attending a performance of the Nutcracker along with your parents, aunt and uncle. Everyone meets at your home for a potluck meal. As planned, your aunt and cousins bring an appetizer. Cousin Rachel brings a gelatin cream-cheese mould in the shape of a wreath with kiwis on the surface and, for a festive touch, crushed candy cane sprinkles. It gets put in the back of the fridge.</p>
<p>Should you have served the dish?</p>
<p>8Y ou are a first-year university student without any family in town and have been invited to a fellow student's house for Christmas dinner. You are a vegetarian but don't want to burden the host.</p>
<p>Should you let your eating habits be known?</p>
<p>9 Friends are hosting an open house. They and their daughters have received the H1N1 vaccine. To ensure a safe celebration, the hosts have decided to have a no-handshake party and instead greet guests with fist bumps and hugs without kisses.</p>
<p>Is this greeting acceptable?</p>
<p>10 Your parents live miles away and visit during the holidays, when they spoil your children. You graciously thank your parents but know there is no way your kids will wear all the cute outfits. Once they leave, you give some of the toys to charity and exchange the outfits for more practical wear.</p>
<p>Should you have kept the gifts?</p>
<p>AND THE ETIQUETTE EXPERT SAYS ...</p>
<p>1. Re-gifting used to be a complete no-no but is generally acceptable given the economic situation. Recycling a gift is also OK if it is store-bought with originally packaging and tags and not made especially for you. Remember, as Oprah says, "doubt means don't."</p>
<p>If you are afraid of hurting someone's feelings or there is a slim chance that your worlds will collide, don't.</p>
<p>2. Call a sitter on this one.</p>
<p>Without the children's names on the invitation they are not invited. The same rule applies to the office party. Generally, all invitees are listed on the invitation. If you</p>
<p>receive a work invitation with only your name on it, go solo,</p>
<p>especially during office hours.</p>
<p>When in doubt, simply ask the host.</p>
<p>3. Although a good choice for this person, gifts to the boss are discouraged. They may be perceived as seeking personal favours and for that reason it is best to offer a group gift or to express sentiments in a card. Alcohol gifts are discouraged, especially in the workplace.</p>
<p>4. This scenario is appropriate if you do not wish to reciprocate gifts annually with your neighbour, especially since you took the time to write a thank you note.</p>
<p>The same scenario would apply to holiday cards. Should you receive a greeting card and you do not wish to include the good wisher on your annual list, just thank them the next time you see or speak to them. If you wish to add them to your list, reciprocate by sending your holiday card.</p>
<p>You can always have a couple of "just in case" gifts wrapped and ready to go. A hostess gift with a holiday theme such as centrepieces, ornaments, hand towels, family games, fancy glasses or a box of chocolates is ideal.</p>
<p>5. Due to your current budgetary restrictions, it is OK to forgo this tradition. The main point of this gesture is the recognition of good service throughout the year. Express your appreciation in a holiday card with or without an explanation for the lack of tip or gift. Your card could be accompanied by baked goods or a homemade craft.</p>
<p>6. This strategy works. Not every gift has to be different. It especially works since your children will be involved in the process and will learn the tradition of gift giving in recognition of the efforts and affection of those around them.</p>
<p>Gifts suggestions include holiday music CDs, ornaments or plants and gift cards to a bookstore, coffee shop or movie theatre.</p>
<p>7. Although it may not appeal to you and your other guests, as a hostess you graciously accept the contribution and serve it.</p>
<p>If you receive a box of chocolates as a hostess gift, you would serve it at dessert. On the other hand, if you receive a bottle of wine, you have the choice of saving it for later or serving it, if it pairs well with your meal.</p>
<p>8. It is best to inform your host and volunteer to bring a vegetarian dish. If a guest has allergies, it is imperative to advise the host.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Condo fever; Investors are hot for urban condos, predicting they are safer than the stock market when it comes to protecting and growing savings</b>

</p>
<p>H1N1 might be fading fast, but condo investment fever is raging in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Last week, 350 eager buyers packed the sales centre of The Wellington at Island Park, the latest condo project in the trendy Wellington Village/Westboro area.</p>
<p>The 39-unit boutique building, due to open in 2011, is a Theberge Homes project. Within a couple of hours, 93 holds had been put on the apartments, many by investors hoping to profit from the upward spiral in condo prices. There are a few condos left, including a pair of penthouses.</p>
<p>In November, Phoenix Homes' 65-unit Daly Square at the corner of King Edward and Daly Avenue sold out in about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>"I'd say 30 per cent were investors," says Marnie Bennett of Bennett Real Estate Professionals, realtors for the Wellington project. "This market is booming."</p>
<p>Phase 3 of Claridge's tower on Rideau Street also stirred up investors last month.</p>
<p>Little wonder, with the kind of potential profits being touted by those in the know.</p>
<p>Cory Garlock and his wife Joslin Palleck bought a two-bedroom, east-end investment condo five years ago for $185,000. Not only have they had no trouble renting the two-bedroom condo, with the income roughly covering their mortgage payments, but they recently had it assessed at $230,000.</p>
<p>You can understand why they patiently stood in line for two hours late last month at The Wellington's sales office. They wound up buying The Winona, a two-bedroom, 768-square-foot condo with a balcony, priced in the mid-$300s on the opening night "We'll probably hold it for five years, then refinance it and use the equity to buy another one," says Cory, an investment specialist with RBC's Carlingwood branch. Palleck, a teacher, is confident they'll have no trouble renting the condo when the building is completed in 2011. "We really like the neighbourhood," she says.</p>
<p>Garlock, despite the surge in value of his east-end property, preaches a conservative gospel when it comes to investment condos.</p>
<p>"Slow and steady wins the race in Ottawa. My rule of thumb is don't count on more than three per cent appreciation annually.</p>
<p>Also, you're making a two- or three-per-cent pay down on your mortgage, so you're making about five or six per cent." Add tax breaks, including deducting mortgage interest from the rental income, and condos start looking darn tantalizing.</p>
<p>Jeffery Mason thinks so. He and his wife Tracey Perron, both with the RCMP, have bought four investment condos in Ottawa since the spring, including one at Mastercraft Starwood's 15-storey SoHo Parkway. Planned for the corner of Parkdale Avenue and Scott Street, the SoHo was another runaway sales story when the condos went on the market earlier this year.</p>
<p>Mason says that, with retirement a little over three years away, he's been acquiring properties to keep him busy and provide extra income in the future. The couple has set up their portfolio so that an east-end property provides a monthly income, one in the Glebe, where property values continue to rise steeply, is a long-term investment, while the SoHo will likely be flipped once the building is ready for occupancy in 2011.</p>
<p>"House prices have dropped something like three times in the past 50 years," says Mason. "If you went to a mutual funds adviser and said you wanted a fund with a 94- per-cent chance of rising every year, he'd laugh."</p>
<p>Mason feels there's little risk in renting properties. "You just screen carefully. We have such a large number of government employees and contractors who work for the government, and they're all well paid." He belongs to the Rent Check Credit Bureau (rentcheckcorp.com), which provides tenant and other reports.</p>
<p>Such condo investing, or at least confidence in it, is hot across the country. A 2009 <span class="companylink">TD Canada Trust</span> Condo Poll shows that 44 per cent of urban Canadians believe conditions have improved for buying an investment condo, up from 21 per cent in 2008. Low condo fees, good security and an efficient design topped the list of desired features. Parking availability is also a key deal maker or breaker.</p>
<p>When it comes to reselling condos in Ottawa, it's also thumbs up, according to the Ottawa Real Estate Board. Its October sales report lists 270 condos of all types sold, a 24.4-per-cent jump from the same month last year. Average prices are up 14.6 per cent to $232,046 over last October.</p>
<p>Brian Card, president of Ottawa's trend-watching CRG Consulting, points to low interest rates and an aging rental stock as factors spiking Ottawa's condo investment market.</p>
<p>He divides investors into two types. The first are those who, over the past three or four years, have achieved an enviable return on investment of $25,000 to $50,000 by snapping up a unit when it first goes on sale and then flipping it 18 to 24 months later when construction is completed.</p>
<p>The second group includes long-term investors "who just want to get out of the stock market and want an investment they can drive by and see and touch."</p>
<p>There are also doubting Thomases.</p>
<p>"You go to seminars and learn that (condo investing) is easy to do," says Nelson Viegas. A service representative with <span class="companylink">Xerox Canada</span>, he was on hand at the sales launch of The Wellington at Island Park ,but didn't put his money down. "I don't have a really big comfort value with purchasing something, holding it, then selling it, especially with that market value. I've never been one to do anything that's hype. This seems like hype to me."</p>
<p>Viegas says that he worries about riding a bubble that could burst if the city stopped hiring or the federal government decentralized.</p>
<p>Not to worry, answer others. Jurgen Fretschner, a representative with Coldwell Banker First Ottawa Realty, says Ottawa is still playing catch-up in the condo construction and investment game.</p>
<p>In part, that's because we're just starting to appreciate how important a vibrant urban life -- and condos are a big part of that -- is to a city.</p>
<p>Fretschner has sold investment condos to everyone from lawyers to bankers. He's also owned a whack of them himself, sticking with downtown sites by Urban Capital.</p>
<p>"At one point, I had nine of them in East Market, and just kept rolling them over." Even accounting for taxes, legal and real estate fees, he says a 35-per-cent return on investment during the three years or so between initial purchase and post-construction sale is a reasonable expectation.</p>
<p>He finds that smaller units, especially on lower floors, are the fastest resellers. There's also less debt to carry during those crucial pre-occupancy years. He prefers downtown projects because of the projected influx of empty-nesters looking for a fun, urban lifestyle.</p>
<p>Maureen O'Connell, who has sold condos at Urban Capital's East Market, Mondrian and Central locations, says that finding a tenant for a one-bedroom unit for $1,600 a month is a breeze. But why would anyone take a two-bedroom? she asks. "If they can afford $2,000 a month, they can afford to buy a unit."</p>
<p>O'Connell, a condo investor herself, says, "Ottawa is always a safe investment."</p>
<p>Most clearly agree, assuming you pay attention to what and where you're buying, take the time to understand the financial and tax implications, and don't give up your day job.</p>
<p>The only potential flies in the ointment, says Card, would be a destabilization of the market from a prolonged federal government hiring freeze or a subsidy program to build a trainload of new rentals. Both, he says, are unlikely.</p>
<p>Card does wave a warning flag.</p>
<p>"The builders have a herd mentality -- they're all building everywhere. So will we have an oversupply? If we keep going like this, definitely a couple of years down the road."</p>

<div>Weekend Review</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Hypnotists, psychologists agree nail-biting is all in your head</b>
</div><div>Tara Kruger   </div>

<div>893 words</div><div>5 December 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>When you're a chronic nail-biter, everyone's always sticking their fingers in your business. My elementary school teacher once asked me, "Did you know your nails are made of the same substance as a beetle's exoskeleton?" thinking that factoid would gross me out enough so that I'd quit. It didn't. I didn't. I still nibble, gnaw and chew at my fingernails like a rabid squirrel going after Mr. Peanut. My mom tried everything to nip the problem in the bud early on, to no avail. I've had my hand slapped away from my mouth by my boss, co-workers, friends, my boyfriend and complete strangers. I've been a biter as long as I can remember. After a lifetime of daily chewing, my poor nails have been bitten to the quick and beyond.</p>
<p>I don't need anyone to tell me why I should stop. Nail-biting (the medical term is onychophagia) isn't pretty, it can cause infections, it's interpreted as a sign of insecurity by others, and with H1N1 lurking on every door handle, constantly putting your fingers in your mouth is just asking for trouble. I've even developed a phobia of pointing. The last thing I want is for anybody to have a reason to look at the end of my finger. It's downright embarrassing.</p>
<p>"Lots of people bite their nails. It's nothing to be ashamed of," I tell myself, but sharing a body focused repetitive behaviour with Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton provides little comfort. Then again, even Princess Di balled her hand into a fist when it came time to display her engagement ring, lest her raggedy nails be exposed. It's estimated that 30 per cent of children and 45 per cent of teenagers bite their nails. Most simply outgrow it once they reach adulthood, but not everyone does.</p>
<p>With unshakable resolve and a few tricks, many kick the habit. Rubber-band bracelets are quite flattering (wear red and you're in style-step with Kabbalah-practising Madonna), but you have to remember to punish yourself with a snap on the wrist when you catch yourself biting. Nasty flavoured nail polish can be effective, too. There is never a drink or mint close enough when that foul taste hits your tongue. It's like licking the inside of the cap of a bottle of nail-polish remover and chasing it with a shot of lye. Tasty! Band-Aids around the fingertips invite awkward questions, as do gloves in the middle of summer, but you can't bite what you can't get at. Fake nails seem to work. Press-ons do the trick for me, but they only last a week or so. I've never had gel tips, but I hear they are tough enough to break a tooth if you try to chow down on them. Eventually, though, the falsies must come off and you're back where you started.</p>
<p>I have tried all of these methods and have succeeded in quitting three times. But then my fingers make their way into my mouth again within a few months and all that hard work and will power are for naught.</p>
<p>Wally Muller, who owns Advance Hypnosis in Calgary, says my compulsion to chew is all in my head. Some experience in my past gave rise to an emotion that makes me want to bite, he maintains. He uses regression hypnosis to help people identify the root cause of their bad habit and overcome it.</p>
<p>"They don't know where it came from, but they can't get rid of it," Muller says.</p>
<p>"They know it's there, but they don't know what it is. It's called anxiety."</p>
<p>Regression therapy is only one type of hypnosis. Direct suggestion -- you've seen the shows where some unfortunate soul clucks around the stage with his arms flapping -- involves the hypnotist reading a script to influence behaviour while the subject is in a trance. You can buy MP3 recordings and CDs online, and do direct-suggestion hypnosis at home. Muller says this method does work, but only temporarily.</p>
<p>"Direct suggestion in a lot of situations is a Band-Aid. It'll fix it for a while, but then it comes back because you never really got rid of the cause."</p>
<p>Psychologists and hypnotists get along like doctors and chiropractors, but they do agree on some things: most psychologists also think nail-biting is stress-induced. So, if anxiety is to blame for the problem, then all I have to do is rid my life of stress and presto! Nails to die for.</p>
<p>So, I'm contemplating getting what could be the final nail in the coffin of my bad habit: a mouthpiece. Custom-moulded clear covers that fit over either your top or bottom teeth are an option, as is a device primarily used to discourage thumb-sucking; it has sharp bits that jab any fingers that wander into your mouth.</p>
<p>If you do manage to quit nibbling - I'm crossing my fingers for you - the hard part is keeping it up.</p>

to stop biting them.   </p>

</p>
<p>Switzerland has written a lamentable new paragraph in its history by criminalizing architectural elements of mosques, the minarets, lest they alter irrevocably its alpine skyline and cityscapes. Freedom was vanquished by fear, democracy replaced by demonizing the "others" who dwell in their midst.Phobias became policy and government gave in to the mob.</p>
<p>Switzerland drew foreign labourers into its economy, to feed a desire for cheap goods and services. The new arrivals enriched the country materially and culturally. Now a populist, racist and fearmongering campaign threatens to undo morality and progress by reiterating the us-vs.-them model.</p>
<p>Let no one be fooled: Xenophobia is at the root of this reprehensible legislation, and xenophobia is at least as contagious as H1N1. It will spread, and we must as a freedom-loving society inoculate ourselves before the contagion spreads to our shores.</p>
<p>We must teach our children without equivocation that Canada cannot abide by such legislation as Switzerland has passed. We must proclaim clearly that Canada will remain a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic society that welcomes people of all faiths as absolute equals into the fabric of Canadian society.  </p>

<div id="hd"><b>Travel insurance vital during H1N1 threat -</b>
</div><div>Ask Journeys / Ron Pradinuk   </div>
<div>903 words</div><div>5 December 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>E2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>For several weeks I have been peppered with questions about travelling while H1N1 is still a concern. My usual advice is to simply get the vaccination and then travel worry-free.</p>
<p>However, the entire population may not have the possibility of being vaccinated in the next 30 to 60 days, so inquiries turn to insurance-coverage options in case the pandemic gets more serious in other countries.</p>
<p>One of the bigger insurers in this region is RBC Travel Insurance. They recently released their coverage mandates. While it is important to check your own policy, I suspect all of the others would answer the questions below in a similar manner.</p>
<p>While it seems there is much to suggest the worst period for infection may be over by the time the peak winter travel season comes around, it is an illness that cannot be taken lightly. Knowing the facts helps us feel more secure in the decisions we make.</p>
<p>QUESTION: If I cancel my trip because I have contracted H1N1 or similar flu-like illness, will I be reimbursed?</p>
<p>ANSWER The answer is yes, but confirmation needs to come from a physician. You can then cancel or change your travel dates and have your travel insurance updated for the equivalent coverage at no extra cost.</p>
<p>You need that doctor's confirmation, but if perchance you went to the airport with an unconfirmed flu-like illness and were denied boarding, you would still be eligible for benefits under your policy.</p>
<p>If you travelled and then contracted H1N1 while away, provided you had purchased the appropriate coverage, you would also be covered under the medical provisions in the policy, including costs for accommodations, meals and possible transportation.</p>
<p>As always, whenever I give advice pertaining to areas where massive legal documents are in place, the fine print tells it all. You need to be certain you and the insurer are in tandem every step of the way, taking nothing for granted, until you fully understand your policy.</p>
<p>QUESTION: If a government warning is issued, after I have booked my trip, for a country I plan to travel to, will my cancellation be covered?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Government warnings come in a variety of levels. A warning to exercise caution while travelling would not be covered, but a specific warning for Canadians not to travel to a country or a region would be.</p>
<p>It is important to note that it is common for the government to issue a warning not to travel to just a certain region of a country, while not issuing a warning against travel to the entire country.</p>
<p>This is frequently done where a border area may be experiencing difficulties, but the main cities are not affected.</p>
<p>I don't know if this would happen in relation to H1N1, but in a country as large as China, for example, I could foresee a situation where a travel warning is issued against travel to a distinct territory only.</p>
<p>You would not be covered if you chose to cancel travel to a region not specified in a warning simply because you personally felt insecure in doing so. However, you would be covered if your travel plans included the territory in question.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances you would be advised to contact your provider immediately.</p>
<p>In a previous column, I indicated specific circumstances arose earlier this year when numbers of people cancelled travel to Mexico before the warning was issued.</p>
<p>Even though the warning was issued just days after their planned departure date, and still during the period they would have been in Mexico, they were denied coverage. No amount of persuasion was able to move insurers to change their minds, even though the personal decisions of the travellers may have saved the companies thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>QUESTION: I didn't buy travel insurance when I booked my trip. Is it too late to purchase it now because of my worries relating to H1N1?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The first part of my response relates to the broader question of purchasing travel insurance. No one should ever leave this country, or this province for that matter, without having maximum coverage.</p>
<p>I have witnessed too many situations where travellers are sorry after the fact. The cost only seems high when nothing adverse happens. When it does, it suddenly is viewed as a minuscule investment.</p>
<p>So long as you are not experiencing any flu-like symptoms, you should have no problem in purchasing insurance now. With the proviso below, your travel agent will be able to sell you the appropriate coverage any time prior to your departure date.</p>
<p>However, as I have warned people many times, never, ever lie on your application. Insurance companies have the resources to investigate any claims they feel may be suspicious.</p>
<p>Honesty may be the best policy always, but in an insurance application it is an imperative.</p>
<p>Many of the responses in this column are taken directly from an RBC Insurance memo of clarification. While I suspect the others will have similar guidelines, you need to confirm that yourself with your agent.</p>

A nation changes identity along with its clothing.</p>
<p>AVIATION IN CANADA</p>
<p>The Formative Years</p>
<p>By Larry Milberry, 224 pages, Canav Books, $50</p>
<p>More history than coffee-table book, Aviation in Canada brims with tales of dashes and crashes in frontier flight after the First World War.

Clothing as history.</p>
<p>THE BOOK OF NEGROES</p>
<p>Illustrated Edition</p>
<p>By Lawrence Hill, HarperCollins, 510 pages, $34.99</p>
<p>Hill's already-classic historical novel, the story of slave woman Aminata Diallo – kidnapped in Africa at the age of 11, enslaved and put to work on a South Carolina indigo plantation, freed to emigrate to Nova Scotia and, eventually, Sierra Leone – has been on bestseller lists since its publication two years ago. But the story is enriched immeasurably by the hundred-plus historical maps, documents, paintings, artifacts and other illustrations in this handsome version.</p>
<p>THE WAR FOR IRELAND 1913-1923</p>
<p>Edited by Peter Cottrell, Osprey, 248 pages, $33.95</p>
<p>Irish eyes don't always smile in the more than 90 historic black-and-white photographs accompanying this book, chronicling the battle for Ireland's independence. Focusing on the turbulent years from 1913 to 1923, editor Peter Cottrell, with the British army, and authors Brendan O'Shea and Gerry White, officers in the Irish army, offer a balanced account.</p>
<p>BATTLESCAPES</p>
<p>A Photographic Testament to 2,000 years of Conflict</p>
<p>By Alfred Buellesbach and Marcus Cowper, Osprey, 224 pages, $34</p>
<p>One of Alfred Buellesbach's uncles was a German soldier who perished on the Somme in 1918. That personal link to the bloody history of European warfare inspired the German photographer (with British author Marcus Cowper) to produce this beautiful book with its haunting contemporary pictures of old battle sites from Agincourt to Vimy to the Normandy landing. Once-blood-soaked ground now consists of grain fields and quiet beaches, with occasional gravesites and memorials.</p>
<p>SECRETS OF POMPEII</p>
<p>Everyday Life in Ancient Rome</p>

With accessible commentary by a Pompeii scholar.</p>
<p>NEW YORK 400</p>
<p>Edited by John Thorn, Running Press, 469 pages, $49.95</p>
<p>Four hundred years of life in New York. A lot has changed, but some things have stayed the same – notably, the fiercely independent spirit of New Yorkers, working hard to achieve the American dream and looking down on their roots elsewhere. This compilation of essays written by experts in various eras shows how the character of the city was forged and helps explain why the terrible events of 9/11 could not defeat its amazing spirit.</p>
<p>THE GREAT WAR AND MODERN MEMORY</p>
<p>By Paul Fussell, Sterling, 452 pages, $38.95</p>
<p>In 1975, U.S. academic Paul Fussell published his monumental work on the British experience in the First World War, as expressed through the literature and culture of the period.

<p>Bouchard, a professor of medieval history at the University of Akron in Ohio, oversees 16 other academic contributors as they look at the rise of knights in the 11th century and the decline of these “warrior elites” in the 14th century, done in by gunpowder and new battlefield tactics. A delightful book, it matches a lively text written for general readers with hundreds of colour illustrations.</p>
<p>VANISHED ARMIES</p>
<p>A Record of Military Uniform Observed and Drawn in Various European Countries During the Years 1907 to 1914</p>
<p>By A. E. Haswell Miller, edited by John Mollo, Shire, 128 pages, $40</p>
<p>Before the deadly conditions of the First World War forced armies to wear low-visibility uniforms, European soldiers wore colourful and lively dress as a matter of course. As a young man, A. E. Haswell Miller sketched and painted the uniforms he encountered. His artistic style brings forth not just the uniforms, but also the attitudes of these soldiers. The reproductions here, on fine, high-gloss paper, show a vanished world, seen only today in formal military parades. Covering uniforms from Great Britain, France, Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and many more – even Canadian – Vanished Armies will be of special interest to military-history buffs.</p>
<p>THE NAVAL SERVICE OF CANADA 1910-2010</p>
<p>The Centennial Story</p>
<p>Edited by Richard H. Gimblett, Dundurn, 280 pages, $39.95</p>
<p>The Canadian navy celebrates its centennial in 2010, and Naval Service of Canada pays tribute to the men and women, and the ships, who have served so well. Finely illustrated, and edited by former serving officer and now command historian for the navy, Richard H. Gimblett, Naval Service takes the reader from the earliest, and contentious, days of the fleet through the World Wars, Korea and to its operations around the world today. Photographs, schematic line drawings, classic Canadian war art and even cartoons illustrate this well-written history.</p>
<p>GIL COHEN</p>
<p>Aviation Artist</p>
<p>By Gil Cohen, with photography by Dan Patterson, Boston Mills, 144 pages, $49.95</p>
<p>Gil Cohen's paintings are collected worldwide, and this book shows why. Although a professional illustrator for magazines since the 1950s, he admits aviation – from the flimsy biplanes of the First World War to the hulking cargo aircraft that flew in supplies to hurricane-ravaged New Orleans – is his passion. Aviation Artist features uncannily realistic paintings that not only show aircraft at their best, but also the men and women who fly and service them. The Second World War paintings are superb; a treat for historybuffs.</p>
<p>VANQUISHED</p>
<p>Crushing Defeats from Ancient Rome to the 21st Century</p>
<p>By Mir Bahmanyar, Osprey, 320 pages, $34</p>
<p>History, as the adage goes, is written by the victors. But Mir Bahmanyar goes beyond the typical story of battles and delves into crushing defeats where one side is annihilated, if not physically, then as an effective fighting force. From Hannibal's victory at Cannae to the modern age, Vanquished offers an enlightening view of the less-known armies from various battles, and analysis of how and why they met their dooms.</p>
<p>HOUSE & GARDEN</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONAL TREEHOUSES</p>
<p>By Alain Laurens and La Cabane Perchée, 223 pages, Abrams, $44</p>
<p>Exceptional Treehouses is a curious hybrid – 180 pages of treehouse porn, followed by a company portfolio. But if you're the type to spend $44 on treehouse porn, you may well be in the market anyway, and these sumptuous photographs from the firm's leafy European projects are staged with the sympathy and quality of a high-end fashion shoot.</p>
<p>NINFA</p>
<p>The Most Romantic Garden in the World</p>
<p>By Charles Quest-Ritson, Frances Lincoln, 128 pages, $56.50</p>
<p>If walls could talk! In this beautifully illustrated and elegantly narrated journey of restoration, the few walls that remain standing in Ninfa, a medieval ruin near Rome, reveal the compelling story of a house with a magnificent garden that has been in the same family since 1298. Under the tender care and sheer dedication of the family since the late 1800s, the gardens have regained their splendour. This book is the next best thing to seeing this remarkable re-creation in person.</p>

Designer and visionary Conran outlines environmentally conscientious steps that can be taken at every level, large and small, from initial design to retrofitting, from fabric selection to planning a house extension, to make our homes greener, healthier places to live.</p>
<p>THE SELF-SUFFICIENT LIFE AND HOW TO LIVE IT</p>
<p>The Complete Back-to-Basics Guide</p>
<p>John Seymour, with Will Sutherland, DK, 408 pages, $42</p>
<p>Do you dream of shaking off the city, getting off the grid and living off the land? This soup-to-nuts guide covers the basics of growing your own fruits, vegetables and grains, raising animals for food (and, yes, slaughtering and butchering them), foraging and preserving. It also includes a chapter on alternative energy sources and waste management – not to mention instructions on how to brew your own beer.</p>
<p>NATURE</p>
<p>ILLUSTRATED BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>By Jon L. Dunn and Jonathan Alderfer, National Geographic, 502 pages, $62</p>
<p>In the crowded field of beautifully produced bird books, this one stands out for its Audubon-like qualities. It's referred to as the “Folio Edition” owing to its conscious decision to act as a sort of gallery for contemporary bird artists, 20 of them exhibiting some 4,000 examples of their craft, from the glorious wood duck and the jewel-like berylline hummingbird to the quotidian sparrows and wrens and the magnificent raptors. Birders: Make room for one more on the shelf.</p>
<p>LIFE IN THE WILD</p>
<p>Edited by Nicky Munro, DK, 360 pages, $42</p>
<p>Think National Geographic on thicker paper stock and with far fewer words. The emphasis here is entirely on the pictures, and there are hundreds of them, each obviously shot by a world-class wildlife photographer. The animals are divided up according to type – mammals, birds, fish etc. – not geography, and indeed very little of their environment is shown. That information is reserved for the quick captions in the corner of the page. The focus is the creature up close, in all of its beauty and intricacy.</p>
<p>BEAR PORTRAITS</p>
<p>By Jill Greenberg, Little, Brown, 98 pages, $32.99</p>
<p>Photographing some of the most feared predators on Earth felt a safer project after the outraged reaction to her series on crying children, said Jill Greenberg, who set out to capture the “epic power” and “animalistic rage” of trained bears. But while some images would give nightmares to the famously arctophobic Stephen Colbert, there are also touching pictures of bears seemingly as pensive or cuddly as the youthful Knut.</p>
<p>WATERBIRDS</p>
<p>By Theodore Cross, Norton, 344 pages, $125</p>
<p>At 85, New Jersey resident Cross looks back over 40 years of photographing water birds on four continents. In this hefty, gorgeous book, a reddish egret poses like a proud noble, a snowy owl eyes the photographer dangerously and a black-necked stilt looks exactly like a bird on stilts. Cross annotates the photographs and provides another 87 pages of birding memories (“For an hour or more we sat still under a grove of heliotrope trees”).</p>
<p>BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>The Complete Photographic Guide to Every Species</p>
<p>Editor-in-chief François Vuilleumier, DK, 744 pages, $55</p>
<p>This is a stunning visual record of evolution at its most vivid and incremental. The collection of 654 beautifully photographed bird species is grouped in families. Each group of related birds is preceded by a collective introduction. The book offers many hours of pleasurable page-flipping as well as useful secondary illustrations to help you identify females of each species, birds in flight and birds in their winter plumage.</p>
<p>WHOLE GREEN CATALOGUE</p>
<p>1,000 Best Things for You and the Earth</p>
<p>Edited by Michael W. Robbins, Rodale Books, 390 pages, $38</p>
<p>This compendium of the 1,000 so-called best things for you and the Earth provides a lot of useful advice – much of it common sense but nevertheless important to underline – about how to leave a less damaging individual imprint on the Earth. The suggestions for environmentally responsible daily living range from housekeeping to gardening, from pet care to travel, and from beauty aids to the outdoors. The Catalogue is easy to browse; the suggestions come in short dollops and are often accompanied by illustrations. It's also printed on recycled paper.</p>
<p>PLANET APE</p>
<p>By Desmond Morris with Steve Parker, Firefly, 288 pages, $49.95,</p>
<p>Known primarily as an observer of the human animal, Desmond Morris now turns his considerable observational powers to our closest relatives, the apes. Although the book is full of wonderful photographs, it's much more than a coffee-table book. Rather, it's a complete and innovative look at the complex world of apes, the lives they lead and the challenges they face, mostly from not-so-sapient humans. If you had any doubts about our duty to protect them, you won't after reading this.</p>
<p>LIFE WITH DOGS</p>
<p>By the editors of Life Books, published by Life Books, 96 pages, $21.95</p>
<p>The editors at Life promise that readers will be smiling within 10 seconds of picking up this book. No dog lover will be able to hold out that long. The tome is loaded with irresistible images of cuddly puppies, snagglepuss companions and noble service dogs. The text offers poignant quotations from the most literate of their human admirers, including Plato, who posits, “A dog has the soul of a philosopher.”</p>
<p>POLAR OBSESSION</p>
<p>By Paul Nicklen, National Geographic, 239 pages, $62</p>
<p>Paul Nicklen is a native of Baffin Island as well as a splendid photographer, so it stood to reason that his encounters with the creatures of frozen climes would lead to an equally splendid book. And they have. You've never seen anything quite like his aerial view of narwhals nearing a melting ice edge in Admiralty Inlet. Or a penguin chick peering underwater to check for signs of the dreaded leopard seal. Or a wary Arctic fox in search of mice near Churchill, Man. Or polar bears (many shots of them) adrift on an floe. And so many more. Spectacular.</p>
<p>PREDATORS OF NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>By Dave Taylor, Boston Mills, 319 pages, $29.95</p>
<p>Nature photographer and writer Dave Taylor takes you through 12 months of the habits and habitat of the “animals humans love to hate” – our fellow predators. The browsing-friendly format pairs nuggets of interesting and often surprising information with images of a variety of creatures snapped across Canada and the United States, with particular focus on the grizzly bear, black bear, wolf, coyote and red fox.</p>
<p>TRAVEL</p>
<p>FIRST CLASS</p>
<p>Legendary Ocean Liner Voyages Around the World</p>
<p>By Gérard Piouffre, Vendome, 360 pages, $45.50</p>
<p>In the age before air travel, the only way to see the world was to travel aboard one of the many liners that plied the seas. This handsome survey of those celebrated vessels and their operators is accompanied by period illustrations and photographs of the ships, their sumptuous interiors and the glamorous and iconic posters that advertised them. A trawl through First Class makes one yearn for an era when getting there, as the slogan had it, was half the fun.</p>
<p>OFF THE TOURIST TRAIL</p>
<p>1,000 Unexpected Travel Alternatives</p>
<p>By <span class="companylink">Dorling Kindersley</span> staff, DK, 336 pages, $46</p>
<p>This anti-tourist tourist guidebook suggests 1,000 lesser-known but fascinating sites to visit around the world. Why fight the hordes arriving by the busload at a roped-off Stonehenge, when just 33 kilometres away is the much larger (and less busy) henge know as Avebury, where you can wander among the stones with the grazing sheep? Grouped under nine headings, such as Ancient and Historical Sights, Festivals and Parties, Architectural Marvels and Natural Wonders.</p>
<p>BED IN A TREE</p>
<p>And Other Amazing Hotels From Around the World</p>
<p>By Bettina Kowalewski, 240 pages, DK, $30</p>
<p>The title is misleading, because Bed in a Tree covers a wide range of unusual lodgings: a castle, an ice hotel, Cappadocian caves and a converted oil-rig escape capsule. The entries might have benefited from tighter photographic editing.</p>
<p>PARIS POSTCARDS</p>
<p>The Golden Age</p>
<p>By Leonard Pitt, Counterpoint, 182 pages, $33.50,</p>
<p>No city is more photographable, or postcardable, than the City of Light, and this beautifully reproduced collection of historical postcards will make you long for a visit. But until then, content yourself with an aerial glance down the Boulevard des Italiens, crowds milling around the Café de la Paix and exteriors of the Moulin Rouge, with its distinctive red windmill. Comme c'est romantique!</p>
<p>A YEAR IN THE LIFE OF THE COTSWOLDS</p>
<p>By Beata Moore, Frances Lincoln, 112 pages, $37.95</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever done a walking trip in the Cotswolds, or anyone who aspires to, will relish this multiseasonal, multihued look at one of England's most picturesque, and popular, destinations, 800 square miles bounded by Oxford, Bath, Stratford-upon-Avon and Gloucester. Photographer Beata Moore has captured not only the Cotswolds' rambling green charm. but its towns and markers, from Bath Cathedral to Blenheim Palace.</p>
<p>BELLISSIMA VENICE</p>
<p>Photographs by Michel Setboun, Abrams, $55</p>
<p>If there's a city that rivals Paris for photogenicity, it is surely Venice. And the city has never looked more spectacular than in these stunning photos by acclaimed photographer Michel Setboun. A view of the rooftops from the Piazza San Marco, a twilit grand canal, shots that illustrate the city's labyrinthine character. One photo, of a gondolier on the Grand Canal, who might be Ishmael in search of the White Whale, is alone worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>100 GREATEST TRIPS</p>
<p>Fourth Edition</p>
<p>By the editors of Travel & Leisure, <span class="companylink">American Express</span>., 287 pages, $39.99</p>
<p>A brisk, lavishly illustrated guide to 100 vacation spots, each “trip” (destination, really) getting, at best, three pages. As this is the fourth edition, shouldn't it be called 100 Greatest Trips After the First 300 Even Greater Ones? A snappy but useful insider's guide to lodging, dining and sights is found in the back.</p>
<p>PHOTOGRAPHY</p>
<p>THE HEART OF THE GREAT ALONE</p>
<p>By David Hempleman-Adams, Sophie Gordon and Emma Stuart, Bloomsbury, 255 pages, $59</p>
<p>Combining photos from the two great Antarctic expeditions – Frank Hurley's from Shackleton's in 1914 and Herbert George Ponting's from Scott's disaster that began in 1910 – the editors have produced a volume that will be cherished by armchair explorers everywhere. True, many of the images will have been seen in previous books, but there are others that have been reproduced here from the Royal Collection for the first time. The reproductions are splendid, the explanatory matter exemplary.</p>
<p>WIND</p>
<p>By Jungjin Lee, Sepia/Aperture, unpaginated, $50</p>
<p>This series of stunning black-and-white photos by Korean photographer Lee is as much about texture as anything. These portraits of empty, windswept, foreboding landscapes are dense and painterly. You can feel the dark energies of a conifer forest, a panoramic mesa, clouds hovering (and you can sense their movement) menacingly. Haunting.</p>
<p>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC IMAGE COLLECTION</p>
<p>National Geographic, 511 pages, $62</p>
<p>Mining its archive of 100-plus years, National Geographic has produced, as one might expect, a sumptuous gallery of shots of people, places and creatures. There's Fridtjof Nansen in the Arctic in 1894, boys with an Asian buffalo in 1927 Siam, picking peppers in Peru in 1964, an orangutan mopping his cage in 1953 England, a Russian Orthodox priest out for a wintry stroll in 2009. And so compellingly and wide-rangingly on.</p>
<p>PAOLO VENTURA</p>
<p>Winter Stories</p>
<p>Photographs by Paolo Ventura, essay by Eugenia Parry, Aperture, 120 pages, $90.70</p>
<p>Ventura's remarkable eye is so painterly that it's hard to believe these photographs, 65 in all, aren't realist works of art. The core conceit involves an old circus performer, recalling scenes from his life – clowns, lion tamers, tightrope walkers, acrobats – a vanished world vividly and beautifully brought to life.</p>
<p>IRVING PENN</p>
<p>Small Trades</p>
<p>By Virginia A. Heckert and Anne Lacoste, Getty, 269 pages, $62.95</p>
<p>This large tome is a collection of Penn's studio portraiture in 1950-51. As the title suggests, the images are all of men and women working in the trades: butchers, chimney sweeps, furniture movers and so on. It is beautifully bound and represents a true portrait, as it were, of Penn's lauded status as master photographer. It was this series that propelled him into photographic prominence.</p>
<p>A SHADOW FALLS</p>
<p>By Nick Brandt, Abrams, 128 pages, $64.99</p>
<p>This book reveals a sublime Africa, through the lens of an extraordinarily talented photographer. Comprising images of wildlife in east Africa produced with a warm tone that lends melancholy and authenticity, these portraits (as they can only be described as such) feel like they've come to us from a different age. It could easily be believed that Brandt made these photographs 150 years ago while looking for the vaunted source of the Nile. If you have ever visited a dusty natural history museum, these beautiful images will feel familiar.</p>
<p>THE WORLD IN VOGUE</p>
<p>People, Parties, Places</p>
<p>Introduction by Hamish Bowles, edited by Alexandra Kotur, Knopf, 390 pages, $92</p>
<p>Three hundred photos of beautiful people who have been shot for Vogue over the past 40 years, either in their homes, at their weddings, at a party, on the red carpet or as part of a fashion spread. Three words: Charlotte Rampling naked. Two more words: dog weddings.</p>
<p>BENOIT AQUIN</p>
<p>Far East, Far West</p>
<p>By Olivier Asselin and Patrick Alleyn, Les editions du passage, 111 pages, $49.95</p>
<p>Thought-provoking and beautiful, this extraordinary book by Canadian photojournalist and Prix Pictet winner Benoit Aquin renders one of the most severe ecological issues of our time: the desertification of the Chinese landscape. One can almost feel the grit and grime from the sandstorms as they wash over the images.</p>
<p>ROME+KLEIN</p>
<p>By William Klein, Aperture, 2 volumes, 47 and 183 pages, $90.70</p>
<p>If the packaging doesn't make you look twice, these vibrant images of Rome in the 1950s certainly will. Aperture has released this revised edition of Klein's classic photo book in a two-volume, slip-cased edition. Featuring images never seen before as well as updated text by the photographer, this collection is a must-have for any art enthusiast.</p>
<p>6 BILLION OTHERS</p>
<p>Portraits of Humanity from Around the World</p>
<p>By Yann Arthus-Bertrand in association with Good Planet, Abrams, 320 pages, $25.95</p>
<p>Photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand and his collaborators bring the world a little bit closer by asking 40 questions about universal values to 5,000 people around the world. The resulting portraits and responses make us stop and consider our selves, our societies and perhaps understand that we really are not so different after all.</p>

<p>By Robert Koch, Abrams, 511 pages, $38.95</p>

<p>By Deborah Solomon, Abrams, 235 pages, $64.99</p>

A book worthy of anyone interested in art, culture and craft.</p>
<p>100 PHOTOS THAT CHANGED CANADA</p>
<p>By Mark Reid, HarperCollins, 230 pages, $45</p>
<p>While few of the photos – many familiar – actually changed Canada, this collection of images from pre-Confederation until the present represent many of the key moments in our history. Conflicts at home and abroad, natural disasters and social and political events are all represented alongside short, breezy essays on the facing pages.</p>
<p>NORMAN ROCKWELL</p>
<p>Behind the Camera</p>
<p>By Ron Schick, Little, Brown, 223 pages, $49.99</p>
<p>The art of Norman Rockwell is iconic; each painting of his decades of work is a frozen pantomime of Americana. They were works of artistic genius but also of meticulous preparation. This fascinating book is the first to explore the carefully composed photographs Rockwell staged and from which he worked. His models were “real” people and he often got into the act himself, contorting and mugging to achieve that signature “Rockwell” look.</p>
<p>ART & DESIGN</p>
<p>A. Y. JACKSON</p>
<p>The Life of a Landscape Painter</p>
<p>By Wayne Larsen, 265 pages, Dundurn, $60</p>
<p>The first full-length history of a Canadian icon? So it would seem, and an elegant one that treats the painter's life and works with reverence. Unlike most biographies, this one is presented in digestible segments that allow the reader's eye to flit from canvas to canvas without sacrificing the artist's life tale.</p>
<p>MARLENE DUMAS</p>
<p>By Dominic Van Den Boogerd, et al., 238 pages, Phaidon, $79.95</p>
<p>A career retrospective of the acclaimed South African-born, Amsterdam-resident feminist painter whose figurations call up questions of race, gender, violence, sex and mortality, generally with unusual, haunting restraint – and then occasionally with blunt explicitness. As usual for Phaidon, it's a volume rich in commentary, interviews and other documentation, but the pages on which Dumas's pictures stand alone have the most impact, though you could be left wondering whether the style, both pictorial and intellectual, will soon seem dated.</p>
<p>FRESCOES OF THE VENETO</p>
<p>Venetian Palaces and Villas</p>
<p>By Filippo Pedrocco, Massimo Favilla and Ruggero Rugolo, Vendome, 432 pages, $165</p>
<p>Featuring sumptuous photography by Luca Sassi, this eight-pound tome is worth the weight of the gold used in many of the freschi – from complex allegories to baroque masterpieces – featured here. From its arrival in Venice mid-16th century to its popularity among the nobility, the fresco's Venetian story mirrors that of La Serenissima itself: city of hidden wonders.</p>
<p>IRISES</p>
<p>Vincent Van Gogh in the Garden</p>
<p>By Jennifer Helvey, Getty, 194 pages, $24.95</p>
<p>Through the inquisitive eye of the author, we follow Vincent Van Gogh's particular passion for irises, amid his remarkable flower and garden paintings, beautifully reproduced here. Helvey explores the artist's struggles with his inner demons, as well as the way he absorbed and integrated Japanese and other artistic influences into his work. His irises emerge as a source of comfort and solace for a deeply troubled artistic soul.</p>
<p>PAINTING TODAY</p>
<p>By Tony Godfrey, Phaidon Press, 448 pages, $90</p>
<p>Godfrey, director of research at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> Institute of Art, explores contemporary painting with prints displayed on quality stock. Against the rise of film, video, computer-generated graphics and multimedia art, Godfrey explains how painting has flourished from the inspiration of other art forms, abetting his opinion by quoting numerous artists. Chapters include Neo-expressionism, Ambiguous Abstraction, Death and Life, Post-feminism, Installation Painting and the Leipzig School.</p>
<p>SURREALIST PAINTERS</p>
<p>A Tribute To The Artists and Influence of Surrealism</p>
<p>By Sarane Alexandrian, Hanna Graham, 301 pages, $44</p>
<p>Neither this book's claim “that surrealism was the most important movement in art and poetry of the preceding century” nor its handy thumbnail mini-pedia of artist bios adds much to the raft of other available volumes. But the generous heaping of handsome reproductions of seldom-seen works offers fertile mulch for dreaming and a reminder that surrealism's oneiric juxtapositions – while often puerile, porny and thin on painterly effect – were also pretty cool a lot of the time.</p>
<p>ART DECO COMPLETE</p>
<p>The Definitive Guide to the Decorative Arts of the 1920s and 1930s, by Alastair Duncan, Abrams, 544 pages, $162.50</p>

<p>THE AUTOMATISTE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>Montreal, 1941-1960</p>
<p>By Roald Nasgaard and Ray Ellenwood, Douglas & McIntyre, 154 pages, $60</p>
<p>For the artist or art lover, or Canadian history buffs, this book showcases a particular turning point in Canadian art. In the 1940s, an group of Montreal artists helped to shape Canada's avant-garde movement by practising automatism, an instinctive approach to creating art. The Montreal Automatiste movement also included literature, theatre and dance, documented here with vibrant colour plates and archival images, and commentary by art historians.</p>
<p>ART OF THE CELTS</p>
<p>700 BC to 700 AD</p>
<p>By Felix Muller, 303 pages, Cornell University Press,, $85</p>
<p>A major exhibition in Venice in 1991 celebrated the Celts as the first Europeans. The premise has some legs when discussing Celtic art, in that it was found throughout Europe, with unified themes. This informative book begins in 700 BC with colourful display pottery and proceeds through the centuries to book illuminations created in Christian monasteries in the eighth century. Concentrating on ornamentation as the Celts' main form of expression, weapons, helmets, chariots, pottery, jewellery and coinage are shown in colour and black and white photographs.</p>
<p>THE MARCHESA CASATI</p>
<p>Portraits of a Muse</p>
<p>By Scot Ryersson and Michael Orlando Yaccarino, Abrams, 240 pages, $64.99</p>
<p>In the early-20th century, Italy's wealthiest woman thrilled and scandalized European society. She also threw one heck of a swell party. “I want to be a living work of art,” she famously said, and with exploits such as wearing snakes as jewellery and strolling naked beneath furs with her two cheetahs, she was. The Marchesa inspired many of the greatest painters, sculptors and photographers of the day, and her influence is still felt among fashion designers. Take that, Madonna.</p>
<p>PRESTON SINGLETARY</p>
<p>Echoes, Fire, and Shadows</p>
<p>By Melissa G. Post, Douglas & McIntyre/Museum of Glass, 148 pages, $60</p>

The artist brings together European glass-blowing tradition with Northwest Coast design, depicting traditional cultural and historical images in his richly detailed, beautifully coloured glass objects.</p>
<p>CARS</p>
<p>Freedom, Style, Sex, Power, Motion, Colour, Everything</p>
<p>By Stephen Bayley, photography by Tif Hunter, Conran Octopus, 384 pages, $80</p>
<p>As you can infer from the title (from Tom Wolfe's The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby), this handsome offering is a kind of hymn to the automobile, sung in tandem by British culture guru Stephen Bayley and photographer Tif Hunter. Bayley, with erudition and wit, looks at 86 cars – from the 1908 Ford Model T to the 2003 BMW5 Series – to make his case that the car, as object, represents one of the most distinctive artistic expressions of the modern era. With 400 black-and-white toned photographs, and packaged in a faux-suede hardcover with a slip case, this sumptuous look at the automobile is sure to rev up the interest.</p>
<p>HATS</p>
<p>An Anthology</p>
<p>By Stephen Jones, V&A Publishing, 125 pages, L19.99</p>
<p>Published to accompany an exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, Hats offers an unprecedented view of the world of millinery from ancient Egypt to Tudor berets and a 1950s Balenciaga hat to Jones's own exquisitely crafted creations, which used radical materials and designs to ignite a revival of British millinery in the early 1980s. Today, those wearing Jones's edgy designs include Gwen Stefani, Boy George, Kylie Minogue, Dita Von Teese and Madonna. A celebration of the appeal and delight of wearing hats. Includes specially commissioned chapter illustrations by Lawrence Mynott.</p>

<p>LIKEWISE</p>
<p>The High School Chronicles of Ariel Schrag</p>
<p>By Ariel Schrag, Simon & Schuster, 408 pages, $21</p>
<p>This is the final instalment of Eisner Award-nominated Schrag's four-volume autobiographical opus chronicling her high-school years. Schrag's stream-of-consciousness writing style and juvenile artwork invigorate the confessional bildungsroman that is a well-trod graphic novel genre. Unlike Alison Bechdel's Fun Home, a paragon of this type, Likewise was written within scant years of the unfolding events. The result is a just-budding artistry, intellectualism and an exceptionally authentic, raw teenage voice.</p>

<p>Edited by Warren Clements, McArthur & Company, 176 pages, $19.95</p>
<p>The news events of 2008-09 delivered such graphic gold as Julie Couillard's left boob, Sarah Palin's big specs and Lord Conrad Black in jailbird stripes. Those were the sideshows. This collection sprinkles the lighter fare among the meatier events – the mortgage meltdown's tumbling houses of cards, the taxpayer bailouts of captains of industry, Barack Obama's ascension and inevitable fizzle, and the porky peril of the swine-flu pandemic.</p>
<p>CELEBRATING PEANUTS</p>

<p>The First 25 Years</p>
<p>Edited by Jann S. Wenner, HarperCollins, 256 pages, $49.99</p>
<p>This book takes you to the Waldorf Astoria in New York for the annual induction ceremony, reprinting toasts, anecdotes and acceptance speeches. Testimonials range from Bono on Bruce Springsteen (“more than a Boss, he's the owner”), to Robbie Robertson on Eric Clapton, to Alicia Keys on Isaac Hayes, to Neil Young on Paul McCartney (“creating this wonderful thing that none of us could really fathom at the time”).

<p>THE VELVET UNDERGROUND</p>
<p>New York Art</p>
<p>Edited by Johan Kugelberg, 320 pages, Rizzoli, $62</p>
<p>The band that launched a thousand bands, the root of glam and post-punk, the photonegative of the sixties sensibility, the musical outlet of the Warhol Factory. … If you care, you don't need a book to tell you. But you will want, maybe crave, this monograph-compendium-imaginarium of rare photos, posters, documents, testimony, oral history and gossip, one of the most ridiculously gorgeous tributes any rock group ever received.</p>
<p>BON JOVI</p>
<p>When We Were Beautiful</p>
<p>By Bon Jovi and Phil Griffin, 184 pages, Collins Design, $35</p>
<p>As an official chronicling, When We Were Beautiful is “halfway there,” to quote one of the band's signature hits. The publisher promises exclusive photos and inside stories. The images deliver, but even ardent fans might be underwhelmed by the insight imparted by the singer's pre- stage routine: “Before every show, I warm up my vocal cords. But after the show, I cool down.”</p>
<p>LET IT BLEED</p>
<p>The Rolling Stones, Altamont, and the End of the Sixties</p>
<p>By Ethan A. Russell (with Gerard Van der Leun), Springboard Press, 242 pages, $43</p>
<p>The Rolling Stones' ill-fated free concert at Altamont is well documented in books, and, most effectively, by the 1970 film Gimme Shelter, directed by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin. This book dedicates its final 80 pages to that ultraviolent December, 1969, event. But its real glory is in its first 160 pages, which recreate in interviews and never-before-seen photos the 16-show American tour that preceded Altamont. It was a transcendent, raw, powerful rock ‘n' roll tour that produced one of the great live records of all time, and this book gives it its due.</p>
<p>WHO SHOT ROCK AND ROLL</p>

<p>By Gail Buckland, Knopf, 324 pages, $47</p>
<p>A companion volume to the exhibition running at the Brooklyn Museum of Art through Jan. 31, 2010. Buckland, at one time a curator with Britain's Royal Photographic Society, presents more than 120 photographs of the famous (Dylan, Stones, Elvis, Hendrix, James Brown) and not-so famous (Wardruna?) shot in sundry milieus by an equally mixed bag of photographers.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Calls to cancel H1N1 vaccinations follow pandemic's slowing spread</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>594 words</div><div>5 December 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>With H1N1 poised to enter history as the least deadly of four global flu pandemics, some experts are calling for an end to Canada's mass vaccination program.</p>
<p>Nature is already achieving what we would hope to achieve by vaccinating, they say.</p>
<p>H1N1's "reproductive number" -- the number of people each infected person passes the virus to -- was above one when the epidemic began, which led to the explosive initial increase in cases.</p>
<p>Now it is less than one, because many people have become immune, and each old case is making less than one new case. When the reproductive number falls below one, the epidemic can't sustain itself, and fades away.</p>
<p>The drop in cases suggests Canada has hit the critical fraction of the population that needs to be vaccinated to control the pandemic, says Dr. David Fisman, a University of Toronto expert in infectious disease dynamics.</p>
<p>Fisman can't understand the rationale for continuing mass vaccinations. He said that for a virus as contagious as H1N1, fewer than 30 per cent of the population needed vaccination to reach a critical level of immunity.</p>
<p>"I'm sure that the vaccine has prevented some deaths. I'm sure that there are people who are alive right now who would not have been alive if we hadn't vaccinated," he says. But the pandemic was already peaking, and then subsiding before the vaccination was rolling out in force.</p>
<p>"That's nobody's fault, that's just how long it took to make a vaccine against a brand new virus. Those were the cards we were dealt," says Fisman, an associate professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.</p>
<p>Someone vaccinated today may be protected against infection two weeks from now, "if there is still enough of [H1N1] kicking around," Fisman says. But the benefit diminishes the further into the future we go, and he says other public health programs have suffered as staff and resources were redeployed to the H1N1 campaign. In some jurisdictions, breastfeeding support programs, sexually transmitted diseases clinics and other usual activities were cancelled or postponed as public health was forced to bear the brunt of delivering the largest immunization program in Canada's history.</p>
<p>"At this point, in terms of saying everybody must get vaccinated because there is a pandemic abroad, it's kind of done," Fisman says.</p>
<p>H1N1 will likely die out with a death rate lower than that for regular seasonal flu.</p>
<p>When the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in June, officials warned the rogue virus threatened all of humanity.</p>

<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>2215 words</div><div>5 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>IN01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Tony Rosato, former star of SCTV and Saturday Night Live, is finally a free man.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2005 the actor, best known for his zany comic characters, frantically complained to police that his wife, Leah, and their infant daughter had been replaced by imposters.</p>
<p>He ended up spending almost four years in custody - more than twoof them in jail, followed by confinement in a psychiatric hospital as part of his probation.</p>
<p>Rosato pleaded not guilty at his trial in September 2007. Although a judge found him guilty of criminally harassing Leah, he was not convicted and was handed a conditional discharge. He's now out of hospital but will continue to be on probation until next September.</p>
<p>And his demons appear to have been vanquished by anti-psychotic medication.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old actor is back in Toronto living with family, falling in love with his wife all over again, and taking steps to relaunch his career.</p>
<p>"I'm okay," a low-key Rosato told the Star in a recent interview, his first since he was released from Kingston's Providence psychiatric facility in March. "Everything is all right. There have been a lot of misunderstandings and they've been cleared up."</p>
<p>Rosato was sitting in the boardroom at The Characters Talent Agency on Elm St. with his agent, Larry Goldhar. His dark hair was groomed back, and he wore a pressed blue shirt and a sports jacket, his signature black cowboy boots peering from under black trousers.</p>
<p>He seemed composed and upbeat.</p>
<p>Looking back on his legal difficulties, he blames himself for "erroneous statements ... a series of misunderstandings ... a mistake in (my) judgement ... "</p>
<p>He concludes: "They have been cleared up ... It had to be corrected, it got corrected."</p>
<p>He recalls an early court appearance when "something just didn't click. I didn't recognize (Leah)." Then he adds, deadpan: "Well I didn't have my glasses on, for one, and she was way across the other side of the room."</p>
<p>Acknowledging that his meds are helping, Rosato repeatedly expresses his gratitude for the "miracle" of being free and having "the privilege ... to start over again."</p>
<p>And he's being welcomed back. The actor is looking forward to a 50th-anniversary celebration at the Second City comedy club in Chicago next weekend. Rosato, who got his start at the Toronto Second City offshoot, is being flown down for the event. And Andrew Alexander, Second City CEO and co-founder, says he hopes Rosato will do some improv with some former colleagues on Saturday night.</p>
<p>As for Rosato's rapport these days with his wife, he says "there's a lot of romance in it," adding that he's impressed by her "dedication, devotion ... how committed she is to staying with the relationship.</p>
<p>"I apologized for everything that may have happened that caused her any problems." For her part, Leah Rosato, 32, said in a phone interview from the Kingston apartment she shares with their daughter that she's putting the nightmare of the past five years behind her. "I feel safe with (Tony). We concentrate on the present moments and our dreams and hopes for the future. Eventually we hope that we can be fully reconciled."</p>
<p>While on probation, Tony is allowed one private but supervised visit with Leah (a social worker sits outside) each month, in a meeting room at North York General Hospital. They hold hands, kiss, share confidences. "It's such a sparse amount of time we get to spend with each other, an hour," Tony says. "So it's like meeting her for the first time each time. It's like a dating process."</p>
<p>Rosato has no doubt that the woman he meets with is the real Leah. "No, God no," he responds when asked.</p>
<p>"Leah has been speaking to the parole officer in Kingston," notes Tony. "She's been writing letters of support advocating that we get together more often under other conditions than just the hospital."</p>
<p>Leah says she's hoping their next meeting can take place on New Year's Eve, which will be their sixth wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>In October, the two also gained permission for phone calls. They limit their long-distance chats to about three times a week to save on expenses. That's when they talk about day-to-day doings, says Leah, including their daughter and whether she should get the H1N1 flu shot (she did).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tony is looking for acting work. "Right now I'm concentrating on ... as they say, getting my chops together again," he says.</p>
<p>Since back in Toronto, he's been hired to do voiceovers for eight commercials ranging from "car companies to store locations."</p>
<p>Listen carefully and you can recognize Rosato doing the intro to The Ron James Show.</p>
<p>"Auditions are tough," Rosato says. "I haven't gotten everything I've auditioned for, but it's been all right."</p>
<p>Thanks to his conditional discharge, Rosato is able to take on gigs in the U.S.</p>
<p>On Goldhar's urging, he recently tried for and won the lead - an eccentric postman - in a short drama being produced at the Canadian Film Centre. "He was lovely to work with," says Courtney Graham, a resident producer at the centre, the Norman Jewison-founded training facility. "His acting raised the calibre of the entire project. He's a tremendous talent."</p>
<p>Long-time pal and fellow actor Jeffrey Knight says "Its absolutely great to have him back." Knight, who plays Commander Thompson in the movie Amelia, notes that he recently returned several boxes of Rosato's book collection to him - "everything from Galileo to the poet Rumi." Knight had stood by Rosato during his trial, travelling to court in Kingston.</p>
<p>It seemed only right to support Rosato, who's known for his kindness, says Knight. "He's always had that kind of spiritual nature. If this had been another guy (in the same situation), Rosato would have been the first one up to get other improv artists to perform for charity... I've done my share of those gigs with him."</p>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Naples-born Rosato was on a serious roll.</p>
<p>He had started out as a gifted improv comic at Toronto's Second City, going on to win fame at SCTV and Saturday Night Live. Rosato was pegged as the next John Belushi.</p>
<p>Some of his more memorable characters included fictional TV chef Marcello Sebastiano, along with Lou Costello, Captain Kangaroo and Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>Things slowed down when he was fired from SNL in 1982 but, dividing his time between Los Angeles and Toronto, Rosato continued to get steady film and TV work - much of it dramatic roles. He scored a 1989 Gemini nomination for best supporting actor for his role as police informant Whitey in Night Heat.</p>
<p>Rosato moved back to Toronto full-time six years ago, meeting his wife in 2002. His legal troubles began on Jan. 17, 2005, when Leah fled their Broadview Ave. apartment with their daughter, returning to her native Kingston.</p>
<p>On Feb. 5, she was granted an emergency motion for sole custody of their child.</p>
<p>After complaining to Toronto and then Kingston police that his wife and child had gone missing and been switched with imposters, Kingston police charged Rosato with criminally harassing his wife.</p>
<p>And so began his ordeal in the criminal justice system, with his helpless wife watching, frantically wondering why he wasn't getting treatment for mental illness.</p>
<p>The Star broke the story of his hopeless situation after Rosato had been in jail for two years.</p>
<p>According to his lawyer, Daniel Brodsky, Rosato spent more time in custody on a criminal harassment charge "than any other convicted prisoner in Canada has ever spent on the same charges." Brodsky points out that the average jail time for a criminal harassment conviction is one day in jail and two years on probation.</p>
<p>"If the Star hadn't got hold of the story, Tony would have spent months, perhaps years, more in jail," Brodsky says. "If you were to compile a list of errors JPs, counsel (Crown and or Defence), mental health professionals and judges could possibly make in a criminal law and mental health case," Brodsky has said, "and then with the said list in mind you read the pre-trial transcripts (on the Rosato case), you would discover just about every error that could conceivably be made, and no stakeholder is beyond reproach."</p>
<p>Rosato languished in the maximum-security Quinte Detention Centre in Napanee, 30 kilometres west of Kingston, for more than 800 days before he had a trial. While there he was diagnosed with Capgras syndrome, a rare condition most often associated with schizophrenia in which the sufferer believes those close to him have been replaced by substitutes.</p>
<p>Rosato's trial was a media circus that drew a bevy of entertainers, including comic Dan Aykroyd and a band of Toronto Second City performers who arrived by chartered bus, filling the spectators gallery in the Kingston court. His tiny, devoted mother, Maria, made the daily bus trek from Toronto to Kingston. Rosato's Toronto actor friends and his agent, Goldhar, also dropped in.</p>
<p>Under Rosato's probation order, he was required to reside at a psychiatric facility for a maximum of three years or until psychiatrists deemed him fit to leave. The actor was discharged from Providence after 19 months, taking the bus back to Toronto. On arrival he stopped his mother's house for his favourite pasta dinner with her special homemade sauce.</p>
<p>Rosato's story demonstrates that "a person can be mentally ill and not dangerous, and treatable," says Brodsky, who adds that the fact Rosato was put on probation means the courts decided there was no concern about him being a threat.</p>
<p>Although many in the legal community doubted that Tony and his wife would ever reunite, they then decided to try, step by step, to re-build their marriage. "We're still happily married, plan to stay that way," he says. "She wants more children."</p>
<p>Until his probation is up, he has to remain at least 200 metres away from Leah and daughter, except for when husband and wife have their supervised visits. He has no contact with his daughter, now 5.</p>
<p>"I think he's even better than when we first met," Leah told the Star by phone. "Its incredible. When we spend our time together I'm just constantly amazed at how healthy he is. It's similar to when we first met and I was falling in love with him, except its better."</p>
<p>Rosato is keeping to a strict schedule. Every morning he rises early, a habit acquired in jail, and begins a renewed search for work, often working up ideas on an old typewriter. "My main concern is getting back to work," he says. "I miss work, and without work there's no money."</p>
<p>Rosato has rekindled friendships with his actor friends in Toronto, meeting them regularly to talk shop.</p>
<p>"Four years being inside is very hard on the spirit," he says. "It's the beginning of starting to feel free again. But it's shaking off the time spent inside, that's the difficult part."</p>
<p>For Leah, the legal journey to get her husband help was exhausting, frustrating and confusing. "When the trial was over everyone said, 'You must be so relieved it's finally over,'" Leah recalls. "But no, it's not.</p>
<p>"Even after that he was in the forensic unit he still didn't get treatment for a year," says Leah, who persevered to get her husband help, finally obtaining the right to become his "substitute decision maker" as she saw his mental health declining at Providence. Her first act was to require he be treated with an anti-psychotic drug, she says.</p>
<p>New York executive film producer Sonny Grosso has always believed in Rosato. During his custody the two talked frequently by phone.</p>
<p>"He was a major talent," says Grosso, a former police officer whose work on a massive heroin bust was the basis for the film The French Connection. "I've used him is so many of my productions," notes the producer of Night Heat and Diamonds.</p>
<p>When he completes research on the case, Grosso wants to document Rosato's journey back.</p>
<p>"It could make a very, very intriguing movie...</p>
<p>"It's certainly a fascinating story with a beautiful ending."</p>

</p>
<p>You wouldn't describe Howie Mandel as "touchy-feely."</p>
<p>Not only would such a cozy term be emotionally wrong for the edgy, often abrasive comic and host of Deal or No Deal, but it's physically inaccurate as well, a fact you'll discover from reading his new book, Here's the Deal: Don't Touch Me, which explores in depth the fact that Mandel is a lifelong germophobe suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD.</p>
<p>"You know what that means?" Mandel snaps over the phone from his Los Angeles home.</p>
<p>"If somebody is stupid enough to grab my hand, then I have to run into the nearest bathroom, scrub down with the strongest soap I can find, hold my hand under scalding water until I scream and then send somebody out in search of disinfectant.</p>
<p>"Purell," he snarls. "The rest of you people think you discovered it when H1N1 came along. I've been buying it by the truckload for years."</p>
<p>Mandel first went public about his condition accidentally 10 years ago, when he was on The Howard Stern Show one morning and found himself physically unable to leave the studio during the live broadcast.</p>
<p>It seems that one of the other guests had been demonstrating how he could manipulate his genitals in much the same way that children's entertainers make animals out of balloons.</p>
<p>The only problem was that, when exiting, he touched the studio doorknob with the same hand with which he had manipulated his penis - without washing it.</p>
<p>"You have to understand," Mandel says, "to me, that was all the horrors coming together at once: nudity, sex, germs, public exposure. I could not touch the same doorknob that man had used. I could not!"</p>
<p>Stern baited Mandel and provoked him into a meltdown during which he admitted, on air, that he was both a germophobe and suffers from OCD.</p>
<p>"At the time, I thought my life was over," Mandel says. "Now I know it had just begun. It wasn't a secret any more, so it lost some of the darkest parts of its power."</p>
<p>To try to figure things out, Mandel goes back to Toronto, where he was born on Nov. 29, 1955, and recalls a family who, while "they coddled and loved and supported me, were also a bit driven about cleanliness.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm not a doctor. Just because I have the disease doesn't mean I'm an expert about what caused it. But if someone came over to my crib to make nice with me, my mother would wait until they turned around, then spray the Lysol all over the exact spot on the railing they had touched.</p>
<p>"Maybe that's how it starts. Her mom had a cleanliness fetish that she passed on to her and she passed it on to me. That's kinda normal. We all have the same thoughts, you know - you don't want to put your finger on something ooky - but for people like me, it becomes an obsession, a compulsion, and you cannot stop it, and soon it takes over your life."</p>
<p>As if the germophobia and OCD weren't enough, Mandel realized later in life that he had also been suffering all along from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. "Yeah," he grumbles, "I had the whole damn alphabet ganging up on me."</p>
<p>But once again, it wasn't particularly funny to live through.</p>
<p>"My mother would see this kid coming home. I was angry and lonely and resentful. My issues made sense to me, just not to anybody else. And there wasn't a name back then anybody could put on it. It was just me. Howie being Howie."</p>
<p>To anyone who knew him then, that was a frightening thing.</p>
<p>"The most common reaction from adults to me as a kid," Mandel recalls, "was them making a 'tch!' sound and then rolling their eyes. I always let it all out. I had tantrums. I would act out. If I got bored in class, I'd start passing out candy. I didn't know I had a psychological condition. I didn't know I was a sick kid. I was just weird Howie."</p>
<p>But he finally found a place where weird Howie made sense: in the world of stand-up comedy.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1978, he decided to take part in amateur night at Yuk-Yuk's and, although he can't recall specifically what he said or did, he knew that "I was in my comfortable place, my happy place. I just spewed. It was very scary, I guess. The thrill and fear of being on the roller coaster.</p>
<p>"I'm very aware of how the audience is reacting and I rise up to meet them. Okay, they like this, then let's go in this direction. Whoa, they're pulling back, time to try something else. It's just the most exhilarating thing in the whole world."</p>
<p>For the only time in our conversation, Mandel lets a moment go by without filling it, and then he says, "I wish my whole life could be one big stand-up routine. From the moment I open my eyes, I wish someone could say, 'Ladies and gentlemen, Howie Mandel.'"</p>
<p>He became an overnight success by 1979 and rode the comedy coaster for the next three years, putting rubber gloves over his head and acting out any demented fantasy that occurred to him.</p>
<p>Then, in 1982, TV came calling with the most unlikely project: a hospital drama series laced with black comedy called St. Elsewhere.</p>
<p>"To this day, I don't know why they called me. I was a replacement for somebody who was already there that they asked to leave. They shut down the pilot until they cast me. And I always felt like the odd man out. They were actors; I was a comedian."</p>
<p>But he played Dr. Wayne Fiscus for six seasons before going back to the world of stand-up and shows such as the animated series Bobby's World. Then, after the failure of his syndicated talk fest, The Howie Mandel Show, he saw his career dwindling into a series of pointless special appearances.</p>
<p>"I was about to quit the business when they offered me Deal or No Deal. I said 'No, this is humiliating. I don't want to be a game show host.' And my wife said 'You idiot, take the deal.'"</p>
<p>Since hitting the air in 2005, it has revitalized his career "and liberated me to do this book."</p>
<p>Mandel is more self-aware now, but it doesn't mean he's turned into a softie.</p>
<p>"Look, we all know we're going to die. As my therapist says, 'Nobody gets out alive.' So just be aware of what you're doing while you're alive."</p>
<p>He also has the last word on his various diseases. "People always ask me if they're a gift. And I say, if they are, I want to return them."</p>

<p>Desperate women and their children arrive day and night on the doorsteps of Interval House, fleeing abuse. The staff provide a safe haven, unsure if they'll be dealing with HIV, mental illness or the H1N1 flu. Workers at the Saskatoon shelter are guided by one belief: That women have the right to live and raise their kids free from abuse and violence.</p>
<p>Staff protect, comfort and counsel some of the most traumatized and vulnerable members of society. Interval House, which holds up to 34 people, has secured funding to install security cameras in case a gang member or enraged spouse comes calling, as sometimes happens.</p>
<p>Helping victims of often brutal violence takes a personal toll. Studies have shown the workers -- mostly female -- experience higher stress levels than paramedics, firefighters or other emergency workers. They suffer from "vicarious trauma," said Sharon Cunningham, the longtime executive director of Interval House.</p>
<p>"You have to be special to do this kind of work," Cunningham said.</p>
<p>Interval House abuse counsellors and social workers, most of whom have specialized degrees and years of experience, earn an annual salary of $44,928. That's less than the average letter carrier gets. It's less than an insurance agent, a public relations officer or the person who fixes the dent in your car door. The average lawyer, university professor or bank manager makes twice as much.</p>
<p>Cunningham knows her staff are underpaid. She's grateful to the donors and funding agencies, as well as the recent provincial government subsidy that allowed staff to reach their current salary level. But it's not nearly enough, she said.</p>
<p>"Taking care of abused women and children should be a high priority for all of us," Cunningham said.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Who is underpaid? Overpaid? Some would like salaries to better reflect the value of the work and want major policy changes. Others maintain it's a simple case of supply and demand. They say the job market will sort itself out.</p>
<p>There are many ways to determine the value of a job. University professors and engineers are valued for their knowledge and education. Police are important because they face danger and protect society. Nurses and doctors are paid well because they heal and because they are in short supply. Those dependent on commission, such as car salespeople, or on tips, such as servers, are measured by job performance.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan News Network has compiled an extensive salary list of workers in Saskatchewan. The comparisons are intriguing. Should a member of the legislative assembly ($87,195) make more than a veterinarian ($83,400)? Is a provincial court judge more important ($221,000) than a pediatrician ($206,500)?</p>
<p>Why do Saskatchewan-born hockey players and corporate executives make 10 times more than the average brain surgeon?</p>
<p>If dangerous work should be compensated with danger pay, why does a Canadian Forces private fighting outside the wire in Kandahar, Afghanistan, earn total compensation of about $44,000? Why did a recent online job advertisement for an armoured truck driver in Saskatchewan list the starting salary under $29,000? Most farmers, who consistently have one of the highest workplace death and injury rates, make even less.</p>
<p>And finally, if we value our children, why are the people who care for them paid so poorly?</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The average licensed child-care worker makes less than $30,000. Live-in caregivers, or nannies, receive near minimum wages -- roughly $20,000 per year -- and often work in excess of the eight hours a day for which they are paid. The employer typically deducts a few hundred dollars per month for room and board.</p>
<p>Foster parents are on duty 24 hours a day, sheltering the children of unwilling or incapable birth parents. Many of the children require specialized care. The foster parents invest time and love, knowing the placement is temporary and the kids could be removed at any moment. Currently, a Saskatchewan couple with three foster children would receive just over $21,000 a year. A Social Services Ministry official said foster care rates are comparable to other provinces, but would not say whether the government needs to do more to address the drastic shortage of foster parents.</p>
<p>"Generally, people in these positions are underpaid and overworked," said Saskatchewan Children's Advocate Marvin Bernstein.</p>
<p>A major provincial government review into the child welfare system was announced earlier this month, but it's unclear whether payment levels will be part of the review.</p>
<p>Even among doctors, the lowest paid are those who treat children. The average medical specialist's gross income is $390,100. Pediatricians make about half that, at $206,500. Officials in the provincial government and the Saskatchewan Medical Association have long acknowledged the problem, pledging to correct this imbalance. But little has changed.</p>
<p>With a children's hospital slated for construction in Saskatoon in the coming years, Saskatchewan is now losing its only pediatric respirologist. The reason? Dr. Bruce Lothian, who treats emergency cases, has a regular caseload of 250 and has 500 more on his waiting list, cited workload and an unfair payment structure. Lung problems are the most common reason for child hospitalization in the province. A recent review noted the death rate for Saskatchewan kids with asthma is 36 per cent higher than the national average.</p>
<p>"We are defined and judged by how we treat our children," Bernstein said. "That also applies to those who serve our children. They have an enormous responsibility."</p>
<p>All too often, those who work with children are not taken seriously, he said. "It's a lot more than just babysitting. These are vital resources and something has to be done to address the levels of compensation."</p>
<p>The provincial government has partial or full control over the salaries of most of those who work with children in Saskatchewan. A Saskatchewan News Network request last week to discuss the issue with either Premier Brad Wall or Social Services Minister Donna Harpauer went unanswered.</p>

<p>Generally, all news about the H1N1 virus is negative and we tend to focus on the negative things that affect our lives. My family and I would like to take this opportunity to give our heartfelt "Thank You" to all of the health-care workers and support staff for their efficiency, caring and knowledge during the H1N1 pandemic inoculations.</p>
<p>A special thanks to the personnel who handled all the calls and inquiries regarding the H1N1 virus with all the government changes and mandates.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience from a sometimes scared and uninformed public.</p>
<p>From the moment I entered Robert Usher Collegiate for my shot, I was handled with professional courtesy, caring and an inordinate amount of patience from the gentleman who showed me to the waiting area, the clerical personnel and also the wonderful nursing staff that gave me my H1N1 shot. I would just like to say thank you for all that you have done above and beyond during this awful pandemic.</p>

<p>Lucky nurses at the Regina H1N1 vaccination clinic got to needle their bosses Friday -- and get paid for it.</p>
<p>Health Minister Don McMorris and Dr. Moira McKinnon were among those to receive vaccinations at the former Robert Usher Collegiate Friday morning.</p>
<p>But there were some minor glitches.</p>
<p>Despite a message on the Ministry of Health's website telling residents to bring health cards to flu clinics and download and sign the consent form ahead of time, McMorris forgot his health card and McKinnon filled out her form at Usher.</p>
<p>McMorris realized on his way to the clinic that he did not have his card but was reluctant to go back and get it because he did not want to delay his presence at the media event. After an aide brought McMorris his card, he took his place in line.</p>
<p>Health officials received at least one complaint that McMorris got preferential treatment while in line, but he said it was only to accommodate media requests for photos and video.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to go the first day -- I thought, certainly, the lineups would be great, but it's still lined up pretty good 10 days into opening it up to the general public."</p>
<p>McKinnon said about 45 per cent of Saskatchewanians have been vaccinated and expects that will hit 50 per cent by week's end.</p>
<p>"Once we get to over 60-per-cent immunization, it has a protection effect for the whole population and we're nearly there, so that's quite remarkable."</p>
<p>Hospitalized patients are, on average, 26 years old.</p>
<p>"This influenza virus is a new virus and it tends to cause a different type of disease in young people -- mostly mild, but if you get it, you are at risk," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>She expects the second wave of flu will be present until February or March.</p>
<p>"The history of pandemics is that there is usually a third wave, but with this mass vaccination for Canada, we may have eliminated that."</p>
<p>Twelve Saskatchewanians have died from H1N1 and two more deaths are being investigated.</p>
<p>Intensive care units in the Saskatoon Health Region are at capacity.</p>
<p>"They have been juggling and have had to move patients to Regina, but that situation is settling now," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>In northern Saskatchewan, plans have worked well and no evacuations have been required.</p>
<p>McMorris praised health officials for how vaccination clinics were organized.</p>
<p>"Also, the general public here in Saskatchewan have been very understanding and patient because the first week or two there was lots of demand and people wanted to be immunized," McMorris said.</p>
<p>He's not squeamish about needles -- he donates blood about six times a year.</p>
<p>"That needle is a lot bigger than the one I'm going to receive today," McMorris said.</p>
<p>McKinnon's advice before getting the jab: "Just count to three, close your eyes and it's all over."</p>

<p>Hockey has taken its fair share of shots this year -- not least in the form of a study that revealed two decades of declining Canadian interest in the National Hockey League -- but new data shows our national sport still has game.</p>
<p>After being unseated in 2008, the NHL has reclaimed the top spot in Yahoo! Canada's annual compilation of the most-searched topics of the year. The list, revealed Dec. 1 by the online search engine, sheds light not only on hockey's prominent cultural place but also on the people, places and things giving it competition for Canadian mindshare -- for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Rounding out the overall Top 10 on the Buzz Index, in order of popularity, were the online role-playing game Runescape, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (up from ninth last year), World Wrestling Entertainment, Michael Jackson, actress Megan Fox, American Idol, NASCAR, the National Basketball Association, and reality-TV singer Susan Boyle.</p>
<p>"We're seeing the usual mix of news, gossip and perverse voyeurism that we do every year," says Tim Blackmore, an associate professor of information and media studies at the University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>"It turns up one of the greatest weaknesses of popular culture, which is that we're interested in the shallowest of the shallow."</p>
<p>Broken down by category, American Idol, The Young and the Restless, Hannah Montana, Dancing with the Stars and Oprah were Canada's most-searched TV shows, while the movies that captured online attention were Twilight, New Moon, Transformers 2, Harry Potter and 2012.</p>
<p>Although Britney Spears fell out of the overall Top 10 for the first time in years, the singer remained one of the most-searched celebrities, ranking fourth behind Michael Jackson, Megan Fox and Susan Boyle. Lady Gaga placed fifth, followed by Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Swift and Jessica Simpson.</p>
<p>"This is probably the last time, unless they uncover some real dirt, that we'll see Michael Jackson on this kind of list -- which is an intriguing thought," says Blackmore.</p>
<p>"Still, the thing about these lists is that they tell a particular story, but not the whole story... Is this really what the country is saying, or do you have a few hundred thousand people obsessively hitting these sites and search terms?"</p>
<p>According to Hitwise, search engines account for 15 per cent of all Canadian Internet visits -- ahead of both the U.S. and U.K. -- with <span class="companylink">Yahoo! </span>being the third most-used engine in the country. The search engine doesn't divulge total numbers in its annual buzz index but stands behind the data's relevance.</p>
<p>"These are the things that matter to people," says Huw Evans, search editorial manager for Yahoo! Canada. "When we see an increase in searches on a term, it reflects a genuine increase in people's interest because, unlike other products online, this is really driven by users."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, queries for all things "swine flu" shot H1N1 to the top of the most-searched news items, followed by the Iran election, Victoria Stafford murder, Barack Obama and conflict in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Canadian NHL player Sidney Crosby topped the athlete category, with golfer Tiger Woods, boxer Manny Pacquiao, mixed martial-arts fighter Gina Carano, and tennis player Rafael Nadal rounding out the Top 5.</p>
<p>When it came to mobile searches, NHL was once again tops, with Michael Jackson, Megan Fox, swine flu, and NFL closely behind.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Bank makes $220M dent in $1.24B health shortfall; More loans likely, superboard warns</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>655 words</div><div>4 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is borrowing $220 million from the Royal Bank to help cover an overall deficit expected to sit at $1.24 billion by the end of the fiscal year which ends March 31.</p>
<p>That's slightly down from the original deficit estimate of nearly $1.27 billion--not including the $100 to $150 million spent on the H1N1 vaccination campaign--but CEO Stephen Duckett said more loans could be needed in the future.</p>
<p>"We're able to cover our deficit at the moment," Duckett said after Alberta's health superboard released its second quarter fiscal update Thursday.</p>
<p>"Obviously, if we continue on our current trend, we'll have to borrow some more, which is what we said at the start of the year."</p>
<p>Duckett said the board has received approximately 450 suggestions from health-care staff on how to save the system money, the best of which Duckett will reward with prizes out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>The board continues to look for ways to save another $550 million each year on top of the $650 million it says it has already found by introducing voluntary retirement packages, leaving 650 job postings empty and consolidating the payroll departments from the former health regions. So far, about two per cent of employees eligible for voluntary retirement packages have applied, although only a handful have been accepted to date, Duckett said.</p>
<p>"We've still got further opportunities," he said.</p>
<p>"There's a whole lot of other strategies we've got in play that we're still examining because as you appreciate, finding savings of this kind, while still protecting access and quality, requires rigour and requires us to work through this in a systematic and serious way."</p>
<p>He said Alberta Health Services has no plans to lay off nurses and other front-line health workers, even though salaries of doctors, nurses and others make up the biggest portion of the health budget.</p>
<p>"At the moment, we have no plans for compulsory layoffs to achieve our savings," Duckett said.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach has also said no hospitals or hospital beds will be closed if Alberta Health Services runs out of money in February, as a presentation--made by three senior executives to a B.C. audience called The Great Alberta Experiment:First Hundred Days--suggested.</p>
<p>Alberta's health superboard already announced in September it will close 300 hospital beds over the next three years while creating more beds for seniors in the community.</p>
<p>"The board has made it very clear, and the premier has made it very clear that what we're on about is protecting the access, protecting the quality of health care in Alberta," Duckett said.</p>
<p>Liberal MLA Kevin Taft said it will be impossible to save such a huge chunk of cash without affecting services. The Great Alberta Experiment presentation suggested the health system could face another $1-billion deficit in 2010-11.</p>
<p>"There's a contradiction in trying to reduce hundreds and perhaps thousands of staff and cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the system and not affect patient care," Taft said.</p>
<p>"It just doesn't make sense. I don't think they'll see that happen. I don't think they've seen it happen so far and I think the people who really suffer ultimately are the people who need health care, the people who turn up at the emergency rooms or the people on the wait lists for surgery."</p>
<p>Taft said he's beginning to think of the health authority as Alberta Health Services Inc., which is turning to banks for loans.</p>
<p>"Obviously, I'm not in favour of turning a public service into a big corporation," Taft said.</p>
<p>"I think that's completely the wrong way to go with health care.</p>

<p>Ottawa Public Health's portion of the H1N1 mass vaccination is expected to cost at least $4 million.</p>
<p>The health unit has spent about $2.5 million so far to immunize people against the pandemic flu, city council's community and protective services committee was told Thursday.</p>
<p>Each city department is tracking its H1N1-related spending. The citywide campaign has been co-ordinated through the Emergency Operations Centre. Public Health is running the vaccination clinics, for instance, but they have included paramedics giving shots and parks-and-recreation department workers managing line-ups.</p>
<p>The amount of funding the city will receive from the Ontario government is not "fully clarified" yet, the committee was told.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the public health unit said wristbands are now being distributed one hour before scheduled start times of flu-shot clinics, instead of earlier in the morning as has been the practice.</p>
<p>Online versions of consent forms are being updated and are temporarily unavailable on the Ottawa Public Health website, but hard-copy consent forms will be handed out at the clinics.</p>
<p>A list of available public clinics can be found at ottawacitizen.com/flu; Public Health is at ottawa.ca/health and has an information line at 613-580-6744.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>It's time to make the call on swinging sticks</b>
</div><div>Wayne Scanlan   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>905 words</div><div>4 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Keith Ballard delivered the second-most famous golf swing of the week when he nearly van Gogh-ed his goaltender, Tomas Vokoun.</p>
<p>Elin Nordegren is less dangerous with a three iron in her hands.</p>
<p>Ballard, a Florida Panthers defenceman, was properly mortified to discover his anger swing, after a goal by Atlanta's Ilya Kovalchuk, would hurt the very goalie he usually protects.</p>
<p>"I was so caught up in the moment I didn't realize that I did hit him," Ballard told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. "Not until I got back to the bench. I was kind of looking around and I saw the trainers jump over, and the guys told me, and at that point I was kind of in shock."</p>
<p>Bad things can happen when hockey players swing sticks. Not that Ballard cutting Vokoun's ear was remotely like the infamous Ted Green versus Wayne Maki stick-swinging incident during a preseason game at Ottawa's Civic Centre in 1969, or even Chris Simon's whack to the face of Ryan Hollweg two years ago, but ultimately a player is responsible for his stick.</p>
<p>The NHL has targeted stick infractions -- hooking, accidental high sticks, four minutes for drawing blood. If the league is opposed to careless use of the stick, why shouldn't Ballard be penalizing for clipping his own goaltender?</p>
<p>It would be pretty simple to start penalizing players for such tantrums. Surely they fall under the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. The way today's synthetic sticks shatter and splinter -- they weigh three ounces and snap like kindling -- there is a very real danger of a fragment catching someone in the face, whether or not there is direct contact, stick-on-player.</p>
<p>Imagine the ramifications of a splinter flying through the arena netting and striking a fan. Sounds far-fetched, but the league went to great extremes to prevent pucks from hitting fans. The NHL would be more than a little red-faced if an enraged player hurt a fan with his stick.</p>
<p>Ballard wasn't aiming for his goalie's ear, of course. He was trying to whack the crossbar with his stick, a commonly accepted practice for defencemen and goalies after a goal has been scored.</p>
<p>Whenever this disease took root, it spread faster than the H1N1 virus. Go to any minor league or junior hockey game and sooner or later you'll see someone tattoo his crossbar with a stick after a goal is scored.</p>
<p>Young players mimic professional and junior hockey stars. If the players on TV chew mouthguards, kids chew mouthguards. If they spit, kids spit. If they style it after scoring a goal, young players style it. If they whack the boards on the way to the penalty box, kids do the same.</p>
<p>I loved the e-mail to the Team 1200 "Healthy Scratches" program the other day when talk turned to Ballard hitting his goalie. A hockey dad told the story of his son breaking his stick in anger in the heat of a bad moment. The father took his son aside and had the proverbial heart-to-heart talk, except that the son broke another stick soon afterward.</p>
<p>This time, the dad told the son, and presumably his coach, that the boy wouldn't be playing hockey again until Christmas, when Santa delivered a new stick.</p>
<p>Hooray for hockey dad.</p>
<p>A sidebar to the main story: those "twigs" the players are abusing cost upward of $300 per. When an NHL player breaks a stick on the ice or jams it into the ground at the players' bench, he tosses it aside and then grabs another free one from the stick rack.</p>
<p>When a minor hockey player smashes his or her own stick, it's up to mom and dad to replenish the inventory, unless the stick is still within the 30-day warranty period -- and let's face it, there's a better chance of being struck by lightning. Of course, to break a stick and then claim to the company that it broke in battle is compounding bad behaviour with a lie.</p>
<p>What lesson is learned when a stick broken for no good reason is replaced with another?</p>
<p>Ballard received a decent lesson in this case. He got scared out of his mind by realizing he'd injured his own goalie.</p>
<p>"If I'd done that to (Niklas) Backstrom, I would have had my gear off before I even got to the bench," Minnesota Wild enforcer Derek Boogaard said. "I would have gone straight to the dressing room and hid underneath the bus."</p>
<p>What the bus is doing in the dressing room is another story, but you get the idea. Every professional player got a chill watching the highlight reel of Ballard clipping Vokoun.</p>
<p>It's not the first time it has happened this calendar year, either.</p>
<p>Check out <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> for the Tomas Surovy swinging stick that hit his goaltender, Jaroslav Halak, when the two played for Slovakia in a 2009 world championship game versus the Czechs.</p>
<p>Halak, fortunately, was not injured.</p>
<p>Is a penalty called for?</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>Two minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
<p>Once again, hockey has to protect players from themselves.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Too soon to call end to flu; WHO officials press for continued co-operation</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>

<p>It is too soon to decide whether to declare the H1N1 pandemic over, World Health Organization officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>While the number of infections and deaths are falling in Canada and the U.S., "that's still not true for the entire Northern Hemisphere," and it is impossible to know now whether the spring will bring a third wave of infection, Dr. Feiji Fukuda, special adviser to the WHO director-general on pandemic influenza said in a press briefing.</p>
<p>Eight months into the first flu pandemic of the 21st century, "it's clear that it continues to evolve and pose new challenges and raise new concerns, and that we continue to face ongoing uncertainties about the pandemic," Fukuda said.</p>
<p>"In the face of this, WHO strongly emphasizes that continued global co-operation is really the essential basis for fighting this pandemic, and not just this pandemic, but also future global public health challenges."</p>
<p>Most flu activity is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, where activity levels are "up and down," depending on the region, Fukuda said.</p>
<p>"Overall, it's too early to say whether activity is peaking in the Northern Hemisphere, and, at this point, it is also not possible to predict what we are going to be seeing in the spring time."</p>
<p>And while new estimates suggest H1N1 is, overall, no more deadly than regular seasonal influenza, Fukuda warned that it is premature to declare how H1N1 will stack up against past pandemics.</p>
<p>This week, the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy reported that U.S. government officials have estimated that the case fatality rate for H1N1 -- the percentage of people who get infected and die from it -- is 0.018 per cent, "about 100-fold lower than the two per cent CRF in the pandemic of 1918-19."</p>
<p>The case fatality ratio -- the proportion of people with the disease who will die from it -- of regular seasonal flu is pegged at around 0.1 per cent.</p>
<p>"From the very beginning of the pandemic we have pointed out repeatedly that we don't really know what the future is going to bring," Fukuda said. "We still haven't fully gone through the pandemic, and it is possible there could be unexpected events that occur as we continue to go through.</p>
<p>"It is quite possible to have a pandemic on the milder side, and if we are experiencing that, and the number of serious cases is kept down, then it's something for which we should all be thankful," Fukuda said.</p>
<p>He said WHO will seek "the best possible technical and scientific assessments of where we are" and consult with other bodies before deciding when to declare the pandemic over.</p>
<p>More than 150 million doses of vaccine have now been distributed in about 40 or more countries. So far, no unexpected safety issues have emerged, Fukuda says.</p>
<p>He also said there is nothing to suggest H1N1 is becoming widely resistant to the flu drug, Tamiflu, despite reports of 96 Tamiflu resistant viruses among several countries.</p>
<p>"We do not see widespread resistance to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) anywhere," he said.</p>

<p>Not enough diabetics get regular checkups</p>
<p>A new study shows that fewer than one-third of people living with diabetes are receiving all four recommended clinical tests from their health-care providers.</p>
<p>The study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information says 81 per cent of Canadians with diabetes received a hemoglobin A1c test, which measures blood glucose levels over a period of time.</p>
<p>About 74 per cent had received a urine protein test to measure kidney function in the year prior to the survey, 51 per cent had their feet checked for sores and 66 per cent had received a dilated eye exam. Overall, only 32 per cent of diabetics had all four clinical tests in the recommended period of time.</p>
<p>Greg Webster, the director of primary health-care information at the institute, notes better control of diabetes can help prevent serious health complications and prolong life for people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Growing obesity problem reduces life expectancy</p>
<p>A new study predicts that as smoking rates decline and life expectancy increases, obesity figures will rise, ultimately contributing to a poorer quality of life.</p>
<p>A New England Journal of Medicine study looked at previous health trends culled from national health surveys to forecast life expectancy and quality of life for a typical 18-year-old from 2005 through 2020.</p>
<p>Past declines in smoking over the last 15 years would give that 18-year-old an increased life expectancy of 0.31 years.</p>
<p>However, growing body mass index rates would also mean that the teenager would have a reduced life expectancy of 1.02 years, giving a net life expectancy reduction of 0.71 years.</p>
<p>H1N1 scare keeps Santa from visiting sick kids</p>
<p>Santa Claus won't be jingling though the halls of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario this year.</p>
<p>With the Ottawa facility still on strict infection watch in the wake of an overwhelming wave of H1N1 cases, the hospital will bring personalized video messages from St. Nicholas to sick children instead of Santa's traditional bedside visits.</p>
<p>"We want to spread the joy, not the germs," hospital spokeswoman Marie Belanger said of cancelling Santa's annual pre-Christmas visit. Normally, Santa pops in to spread Yuletide cheer to the 156 kids in hospital beds.</p>
<p>Doctor/pharmacist team lowers blood pressure</p>
<p>A new study suggests patients with high blood pressure will do better at keeping it under control if a team of a physician and a pharmacist manage their care.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Iowa conducted a clinical trial of 402 patients with uncontrolled hypertension at six clinics. After six months, the study found 63.9 per cent of patients cared for by doctor-pharmacist teams had gotten their blood pressure under control, compared with 29.9 per cent of the patients in the regular care group.</p>

<p>This afternoon is the last H1N1 flu shot clinic in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Halton's vaccination clinics will run until Dec. 15 and are providing both seasonal and H1N1 immunizations.</p>
<p>The shot is still recommended by Dr. Chris Mackie, a Hamilton associate medical officer of health, despite the fact the H1N1 flu peaked here during the last week of October.</p>
<p>However, he says it's not as crucial to get vaccinated as it was when the shot was first offered to the general public last month.</p>
<p>Hamilton's last clinic is at Jackson Square today from noon until 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Halton has no clinics today but has one tomorrow at the Halton Regional Centre in Oakville from noon to 4 p.m. It has a number of clinics scheduled next week.</p>
<p>Hamilton residents will still be able to get the shot at doctors' offices, walk-in clinics and by appointment at regularly scheduled public health vaccination clinics after today.</p>
<p>Mackie expects the outbreak -- which doubled the level of flu normally seen in the community at the peak of influenza season -- to be over within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>However, it's likely H1N1 will hang around all winter.</p>
<p>Residents are urged to get the shot even if they've had flu-like symptoms. Only those tested can know for sure whether what they had was H1N1.</p>
<p>Currently, only 9 per cent of Hamiltonians with flu-like symptoms who were tested actually have pandemic flu. That's high because normally zero to 5 per cent test positive for influenza this time of year. But it is far from a majority.</p>
<p>Even at the peak of the outbreak, just under half of Hamiltonians tested with flu-like symptoms had H1N1. Again, that is high because normally 20 to 25 per cent of tests are positive for influenza at the peak of seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But it also means just over half of people with flu-like symptoms tested at the peak of the outbreak had a different illness and not H1N1.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- reynolds.globe@gmail.com</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Disney</span> World figured out fair and efficient ways to manage long lineups of people years ago. Come the swine flu scare this year and governments, Canadian and American, didn't have a clue. This doesn't mean much in itself. But what if a <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World innovation could save the world from catastrophe? Would governments notice? Chances are they wouldn't have a clue – though the City of Ottawa has contracted with <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World for a seminar on people-friendly management practices.</p>
<p>California-based <span class="companylink">Intel Corp</span>. is another corporate innovator with a compelling track record. In its second quarter this year, Intel accounted for 80.6 per cent of global revenue from microprocessors – a four-year high. The global recession and the decline of the United States notwithstanding, this was the company's best quarter since 2005's third quarter, when it took 82.4 per cent of the sector's global revenue. Intel routinely gets more than 75 per cent of its business from abroad: In 2008, it reported revenue of $4-billion (U.S.) in Japan, $5-billion in China and $10-billion in Taiwan. Intel is essentially as global as the UN.</p>
<p>Now comes the bonanza – Intel's anticipated share of global stimulus spending. For starters, China's railroad ministry has signed Intel to provide microprocessors for a high-speed railway megaproject that will extend the country's train service by 40,000 kilometres. The project will cost 10 times more than China's controversial Three Gorges hydroelectric project (which cost $30-billion). Along the way, China expects to provide WiFi access throughout the countryside.</p>
<p>Writing in Fast Company magazine, journalist Ellen McGirt puts the profit potential this way: “Expect lots of chips.” For this project, Intel will build a chip fabrication factory in China. And every chip produced will make the world economy more efficient – and the world's atmosphere less carbon-intensive.</p>
<p>Intel expects that the China project will be only one of many, around the world, financed by stimulus spending. Intel's Sean Maloney, the company's top sales executive, says he anticipates “a $3-trillion, one-time spend.” With Intel's powerful, energy-efficient Atom – “the world's smallest processor with the world's smallest transistors” – Mr. Maloney expects the company to get its fair share of high-technology assignments.</p>
<p>Intel says, incidentally, that the Atom chip (which cost billions to develop) has already led to 1,500 completely new computerized products and services – among them, sewing machines and farm equipment that can “talk” with the Internet. Ms. McGirt notes: “Atom has done more for Intel than launch the netbook. It has turned into a product that goes inside anything that needs to talk to the Web – from smart phones to MRI machines.” And this revolution in innovation has only just begun.</p>
<p>This is all very exciting, implicitly making the point that scientific advances represent the world's best chance (momentarily assuming the worst) for human survival. Because it keeps doing more with less, thus conserving resources, science is inherently optimistic. How optimistic? Earlier this year, Intel chief executive officer Paul Otellini announced that the company proposed to invest $7-billion in manufacturing plants in the United States. Now that's optimism, folks.</p>
<p>But the more important consideration upfront is the astonishing contrast in psychology between future-driven corporate investment and backward-based government regulation. In Aesopian terms, the sun represents Intel, the wind represents (for example) the Copenhagen summit on climate change. The sun coaxes and rewards. The wind harasses. The near-invisible Atom, all 47 million transistors nestled in a single chip, holds more promise for a greener world than thousands of pages of coercive regulations – even when translated into thousands of languages.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy published a research report that showed advances in energy efficiency – specifically semiconductor technology – mean that the United States can now expand its economy by 70 per cent through 2030, and do so using 10 per cent less energy than it now uses.</p>
<p>“Between now and 2030,” the council said, “electricity bills could be reduced by $1.3-trillion – eliminating the need, by the end of the 20-year period, for 296 power plants.” And further: “Compared to the technologies available in 1976, we estimate that semiconductor-enabled technologies generated a net savings of 775 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2006 alone.</p>
<p>“Stated differently, had the U.S. continued to rely on 1976 technologies to support the U.S. economy today, we would have had to build another 184 large electric power plants to satisfy the demand.”</p>
<p>There are things worth doing that only governments can do. The list is not long. At the Copenhagen summit, the governments of the world will gather to discuss crude and mechanical ways, primarily laws and taxes, of reducing global carbon emissions. In other words, they will seek to brake the global economy. But slower economic growth means greater waste and less energy efficiency. Putting the UN in charge of the global thermostat is a distinctly disastrous proposition. Free the Atom instead. Learn from the mouse.</p>

<p>Toronto -- As the first decade of the 21st century draws to a close, it's time to agree on an name for it. The decade started out inauspiciously with Y2K hysteria, followed by the election of George W. Bush in the U.S., 9/11, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the war on terror, George W. Bush's re-election, SARS, various financial scandals, a vicious recession, and seems to be ending with a swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>In 1999, I had thought that this decade might be remembered as the Noughties, but a more appropriate name might be the Oh-Ohs.</p>

</p>
<p>Coming soon: H1N1: The Motion Picture, Days of Swine and Doses and Babe: The Final Chapter.</p>
<p>Hey, it could happen, obsessed as we've all become with the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Don't worry if you're feeling nauseated or have a headache, by the way. It doesn't mean you have H1N1. Chances are they're symptoms of how much you're dreading a new wave of "epidemic" movies -- a sub-genre that, like zombies, refuses to die.</p>
<p>Screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (The Informant) is already developing a new virus thriller laced with social commentary -- "Traffic meets Outbreak" he calls it -- for director Steven Soderbergh. It's on hold pending the outcome of the swine flu scare.</p>
<p>Fear seems almost as contagious as H1N1 during outbreaks of such bugs. And Hollywood historically can't seem to resist going viral, eager to capitalize on our fears of infection and the anxiety, paranoia and bizarre behaviour this can engender.</p>
<p>Some such movies -- like 1996's Virus with Brian Bosworth (enough said) -- should be avoided like the plague.</p>
<p>Early entries, some laughably cheesy in retrospect, turned out to be precursors to modern meditations on viruses, plagues and such. Take for example two of David Cronenberg's gruesomely cautionary 1970s virus-driven horror classics dealing with the potential consequences of sexual promiscuity.</p>
<p>Shivers (1975) dramatized the fallout from sexually transmitted parasites. And Cronenberg's 1977 shocker Rabid overtly revisited the theme, with a contagious motorcycle crash survivor (played by former porno queen Marilyn Chambers) infecting horny strangers by penetrating them with phallic stingers protruding from an orifice in her armpit.</p>
<p>While fears of nuclear attacks fuelled Cold War-era thrillers like Fail Safe (1964), mutations of a new yet familiar menace now rule. Bioterrorism, anthrax, antibiotic-resistant superbugs, germ warfare, plagues such as SARS, the Ebola and West Nile viruses, and inevitably the swine flu, provide plenty of fodder.</p>
<p>The calibre of such disaster flicks varies, of course, but many share similarities. Viruses tend to be fast-acting (28 Days Later), for instance; the usual ragtag group of survivors will be ethnically diverse; there will be infighting.</p>
<p>Memorable recent epidemic flicks include Blindness, Fernando Meirelles's controversial thriller about the social chaos that ensues when the government quarantines victims of an outbreak that causes blindness. In I Am Legend, based on Richard Matheson's 1954 sci-fi classic that inspired The Last Man on Earth (1964) and The Omega Man (1971), Will Smith is riveting as a scientist dodging zombie-like cannibals in a desolate Manhattan after a virus meant to cure cancer wipes out humanity.</p>
<p>Director Danny Boyle also did a superb job of conveying social chaos and the dark side of human nature in 28 Days Later, his brainy, unsettling twist on George A. Romero's zombie classics in which animal rights activists unleash a deadly virus in London.</p>
<p>For squirm-inducing entertainment it was hard to beat Outbreak, Wolfgang Petersen's gripping 1995 thriller about scientists racing against time to contain a deadly Ebola-like virus. And Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys, in which convict Bruce Willis is sent back in time from a post-apocalyptic world to try to stop a virus released by terrorists, stands on its own as a cult classic.</p>
<p>The Host, the 2006 Korean horror flick about a river monster slithering through Seoul and believed to be carrying a virus is noteworthy for how it incorporates absurdist humour, socio-political commentary and references to germ warfare and SARS.</p>
<p>Going back 30 years, a favourite guilty pleasure was The Cassandra Crossing, the late Victoria-based filmmaker George P. Cosmatos's hokey but engrossing beat-the-clock thriller about an all-star cast of passengers (including Sophia Loren, Richard Harris and Ava Gardner) imperilled by a virus brought on board their European express train by a Euro-trash terrorist.</p>
<p>And no list would be complete without The Andromeda Strain, the riveting 1971 sci-fi thriller based on Michael Crichton's novel about scientists trying to neutralize a deadly alien virus carried on a satellite that crashes into a New Mexico town.</p>
<p>If you're into horror, Freddie Krueger just doesn't cut it anymore as a villain, with such real fears for Hollywood to draw upon.</p>
<p>Even if some hit too close to home for comfort, box-office returns suggest they won't disappear any time soon.</p>
<p>And if the filmmakers are doing their job right, you'll squirm the next time that guy beside you coughs at the movie theatre.</p>

<p>Residents of the Saskatoon area continue to flock to Prairieland Park for their H1N1 immunization.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, about 109,000 people, or about 36 per cent of people living in the Saskatoon Health Region, have been vaccinated against the virus, says a news release issued by the region.</p>
<p>With 30 nurses working at the Prairieland clinic from now until Sunday, at least 4,000 people a day can be immunized. On Wednesday, 2,600 people attended the clinic while another 1,600 people were immunized at rural clinics and other facilities in the health region.</p>
<p>"The region reminds people that this disease can affect the healthiest individual hard and that people should take every precaution in protecting themselves," said the release.</p>
<p>The Prairieland clinic, which is open from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends, will continue to operate until mid-December. For information about rural clinics, go to the health region's website at www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca[http://www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca].</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Christmas can become, well, a bit too festive</b>

</p>
<p>Ho ho ho hopeless.</p>
<p>That’s my grumpo reaction as a pandemic of Christmas hysteria descends like a depressing dump of snow earlier and earlier every fall.</p>
<p>This year, I began to pout and shout when I watched the commercial frenzy start two weeks before Halloween. Based on this and what I’ve seen happening in recent years, I predict that, some time in the next decade, Waterloo Region will have Santa parades where the jolly old guy will be wearing a red and white swimsuit when he cruises down the Grand River in early July on his personal watercraft.</p>
<p>Now, just because I’m seasonally challenged, loathe snow, can’t stand ding-dong-merrily’s and will never, ever be good for goodness sake, doesn’t mean I’m a miserable grinch. It means I’m a miserable grinch until Dec. 15 when it’s a more appropriate time for the holly-jolly holiday to get started.</p>
<p>There’s something terribly wrong with the fact that, by mid-October, pumpkins and spooky costumes are competing with dire warnings that Christmas is only 70 or so shopping days away. In my community those unwelcome early-alert messages were quickly followed later in October by the volunteer platoon of hydro workers erecting the first Christmas angels and lights in Kitchener’s Victoria Park during our last remaining gasps of sunny Indian summer.</p>
<p>The lights and November Santa parades in Waterloo Region, as usual, triggered the non-stop musical brainwash inflicted by those intent on prying open our consumer wallets. Before Remembrance Day, everywhere helpless, hapless people turned, they were jingle-belled into a stupor with never-ending carols and nauseous Christmas music.</p>
<p>A month ago, during early days of November, I noted with dismay I was listening by telephone to Christmas music while on lengthy hold to a local business that, in between fa-la-las, told me my call would be answered one of these pre-Christmas days because they very much appreciated my business. Then, within a week, I heard the first squawks of piped Christmas music in local stores that were already selling a selection of nodding Santas, scented pine cones and fluffy slippers that played Frosty the Snowman.</p>
<p>While Waterloo Region’s Out of the Cold programs prepared for a busy winter feeding and providing shelter for an increasing number of people facing homelessness, local stores were, by mid-November, swamped with Christmas-gift items that included stockings stuffed with seasonal clothing, hats and a selection of treats - for dogs and cats.</p>
<p>Local agencies starved for cash struggled with increased recessionary caseloads and service demands while shoppers lacking furry pets in need of fluffy booties were confronted in past weeks with a mind-numbing array of princess items, plastic choirboys or girls, battery operated candles, gingerbread houses, French fry cutters and, for the children, electric, semi-automatic mini guns with reusable ammunition.</p>
<p>Christmas was out-fevering the H1N1 flu as food banks here and across Canada reported huge increases in the number of unemployed, working poor and senior citizens appealing for assistance at a time when the recession is supposed to be over.</p>
<p>In Cambridge, staff at the overcrowded, cash-strapped Bridges emergency shelter for homeless people were rationing toilet tissue while Christmas shoppers were told they would never survive the holiday season without toilet-roll dispensers that - you guessed it - tinkled Christmas music every time the paper was yanked.</p>

<p>November, 2006: Mr. Harper declares he will not “sell out” on human rights in Canada's relationship with China. The comment led China to cancel a meeting between Mr. Harper and President Hu Jintao and the Chinese government vows to oppose any “irresponsible” interference in its domestic affairs. In the end, however, Mr. Hu met with Mr. Harper.</p>
<p>June, 2006: Parliament confers honorary Canadian citizenship on the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Who will pay for student busing to H1N1 centres?; School boards want Quebec to pay Bill could reach $50,000 at Pearson board</b>
</div><div>KAREN SEIDMAN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>493 words</div><div>3 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>E1 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccination seems to be free for everyone in the province - except school boards.</p>
<p>At the government's request, school boards are paying to transport students to vaccination centres, but have had no assurances that the government will cover the cost of the busing operation.</p>
<p>"The cost is actually a little smaller than we had anticipated, but we've had no response from the government about paying for it," said Marcus Tabachnick, chairperson of the Lester B. Pearson School Board.</p>
<p>"The government told us to do it and we think it should be up to them to cover the costs."</p>
<p>He said the busing operation will probably cost the board about $20,000 to $50,000.</p>
<p>The board recently adopted a resolution saying that these "unforeseen costs" were not covered in their regular operation grants and asked the government to cover all expenses related to the pandemic plans.</p>
<p>The resolution says that the costs related to the H1N1 pandemic "could have an impact on the services provided to students and staff by the Lester B. Pearson School Board."</p>
<p>At the Commission Scolaire Marguerite Bourgeoys, chairperson Diane Lamarche-Venne said she is not panicking yet about the costs incurred by transporting students to vaccination centres.</p>
<p>“There are rumours that we will have some compensation for that,” she said in an interview this week, adding that the school board has been helped by “co-operative” transporters who reduced their fees for the public health operation.</p>
<p>She said that while she is somewhat concerned about the cost of the operation, it is a humanitarian project that has gone well.</p>
<p>But she did concede that it’s possible the board won’t recoup the whole amount of the operation and that “otherwise it comes out of our operating budget.”</p>
<p>Board spokesperson Brigitte Léonard said about 3,500 students have participated in the program so far, but the cost of the operation hasn’t yet been calculated.</p>
<p>Tabachnick said the costs have been less than anticipated because only about 50 to 60 students of every 400 have been asking for transportation to a vaccination centre. Many parents want to take their children themselves to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>What has him worried is how the government ignored the school board’s requests to help out with the extra costs incurred two winters ago, when the heavy snowfall meant that school roofs had to be cleared to maintain the buildings’ security.</p>
<p>“They just ignored our snow removal costs the last couple of years,” said Tabachnick.</p>
<p>However, he said the government did arrange the hospital-standard cleaning of the empty schools that are being used as vaccination centres in the West Island.</p>
<p>“We’re just hoping to get the same consideration for the busing costs,” he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Survey tracking infection; 700 people have input data on flu symptoms</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>492 words</div><div>3 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>For an e-portrait of H1N1 on the island of Montreal in actual time, please go to the health department's website. While you're there, sign up to contribute a personal update of your own flu symptoms.</p>
<p>So far, 700 people have registered with the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency's pilot project which aims to track H1N1 activity - its evolution, spread and level of contagion.</p>
<p>If the online GrippeMontréal survey works as planned, the Agency's new health-kit tool is expected to serve as a monitoring device or an early warning of other infections circulating in the city, said Louis-Robert Frigault, a coordinator in the agency's health surveillance unit.</p>
<p>"It's a rapid way of assessing flu in the community" according to age and sex, and complete with a <span class="companylink">Google</span> "heat" map showing where the activity is distributed on the island, Frigault said.</p>
<p>But whether people's self-reporting will correspond to confirmed cases of H1N1 is not yet clear.</p>
<p>"We know that flu-like symptoms are indicators of flu in general in the population, and that's our starting point," Frigault said. "We're testing this as an early detection system."</p>
<p>Inspired by similar approaches implemented in Europe, plus the fact that health surveys done over the telephone were becoming less and less productive because many people have switched to cellphones, the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency has turned to such social media as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter.</p>
<p>"But to our knowledge, this is the first time that a big city has developed a regional website to orient public health," Frigault said.</p>
<p>In other H1N1 news, Quebec health officials yesterday reported that the vaccination campaign has hit its stride. So far, more than 3.4 million Quebecers have been vaccinated, including about 155,000 people yesterday, Alain Poirier, Quebec's director of public health, said at the daily H1N1 briefing.</p>
<p>That means 40 per cent of the population has been immunized, including those who developed an immunity by surviving the infection. Still, less than 50 per cent is hardly enough to slow the spread of the infection, Poirier said.</p>
<p>Three more deaths from H1N1 were reported in Quebec yesterday, bringing the total to 71 since Aug. 30.</p>
<p>Although swine flu infection is on the decline, inoculation is still the best defence against the virus, he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cervical cancer survivor urges young girls to get HPV shot; Vaccine protects against four strains of sexually transmitted virus</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>

</p>
<p>Five years after Kristine Fersovich survived cervical cancer, she says she will definitely have her daughter immunized with the HPV vaccine.</p>
<p>"I don't know why you wouldn't want to give it to your child," said Fersovich, 34, about the vaccine that was made available free last year to every Grade 5 girl in Alberta.</p>
<p>Fersovich fought cervical cancer through a radical hysterectomy that took place minutes after giving birth to her youngest son through an early C-section.</p>
<p>Starting in January, Grade 9 girls may also receive their three doses which protects them against four strains of the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus. The virus is estimated to cause 70 per cent of cervical cancers and 90 per cent of genital warts.</p>
<p>"Anything to help them," Fersovich said. "You give them all the other vaccines for getting sick so why wouldn't you give that? To me, it's not worth the risk (to hesitate)."</p>
<p>Too many families are hesitating, says Dr. Barbara Romanowski, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta. Overall, 66.4 per cent of Grade 5 girls in the Edmonton area received all three doses of the HPV vaccine last year, according to Alberta Health Services. Schools that welcomed nurses in to administer the shots--including all Edmonton Catholic and Edmonton Public schools--achieved a completion rate of 68.5 per cent, compared to a much lower completion rate of 18.7 per cent achieved in Edmontonarea schools that didn't allow nurses to give out the shots on school property.</p>
<p>Health officials want to get those numbers up this year, but could be in for a challenge. The vaccination program, which usually starts in November, was delayed until January because of the focus on the H1N1 flu. That means nurses will have to give the third dose in June--calculating enough time lapse between doses--when families are thinking more about summer holidays than protecting themselves against future cancer.</p>
<p>"It's hard to catch kids in June," said Dr. Marcia Johnson, deputy medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services. It's also hard to catch kids in some Catholic school districts across the province that decided not to allow the HPV vaccination program to be administered in the schools. Those include the Catholic divisions of Calgary, Elk Island, Grande Prairie, St. Thomas Aquinas and Lakeland, affecting girls in communities such as Drayton Valley, Ponoka, Wetaskiwin, Cold Lake and Bonnyville.</p>
<p>Those districts, following the advice of Catholic bishops, decided that to give the shots in the hallways might send the wrong message to girls that premarital sex is OK, since the human papillomavirus is transmitted through sexual activity.</p>
<p>When only 38 per cent of girls in Calgary's separate school system received the vaccine last year, compared to 75 per cent in the public system, health officials decided to get rid of scheduled drop-in clinics and asked parents to make appointments with the nearest community health centres.</p>
<p>That's already happening in Edmonton, Johnson said, so no changes are being made locally.</p>
<p>She said the fact that two-thirds of Grade 5 girls in the Edmonton area were immunized in the program's first year is good.</p>
<p>"We would like to reach the other third, so we'll just have to work with the school boards and parents and get the message out that the vaccine is available and beneficial," she said. "The convenience of having it at school seems to really facilitate the uptake of that vaccine."</p>
<p>Romanowksi said convincing Catholic school boards to change their minds is unlikely to work.</p>
<p>"I think it's a lost cause, sadly," she said. "HPV is the cause of cervical cancer, which kills one woman a day in this country, not an inconsequential figure."</p>
<p>She said more than 80 per cent of women will be exposed to HPV in their lifetime.</p>
<p>"We're not even vaccinating 80 per cent of our young girls," Romanowski said. "I don't understand if the low numbers are related to 'HPV is an STD and my daughter will never get one of these so she doesn't need to be vaccinated,' or 'this is a new vaccine and I'm not comfortable.' "</p>
<p>Romanowski said it's likely a combination of the two.</p>
<p>"Sex continues to be an item, a topic, that most people find very uncomfortable to talk about. We need to continue to educate parents and kids about this disease."</p>
<p>Fersovich agrees. Her daughter, Alexis, will get the shot at St. Martha Catholic Elementary School next year when she's in Grade 5. That shot wasn't available for Fersovich, or for Fersovich's mother who also survived cervical cancer at age 28.</p>
<p>"I want my daughter to get (the shot). I think it's very important," said Fersovich, who had abnormal bleeding and abdominal pain for a long time before she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2004.Doctors couldn't find any explanation until a Pap smear, done late in Fersovich's third pregnancy, picked up cancerous cells.</p>
<p>Baby Brock was born three weeks early so the cells could be removed along with Fersovich's cervix and uterus.</p>
<p>"I was lucky to have Brock," she said. "I was definitely very lucky."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fitness and the flu; Exercise can be an ally against illness, so take precautions and pay attention to bodily signals</b>
</div><div>Jill Barker   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>706 words</div><div>3 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>E5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>

<p>Exercise is a known immunity booster, which is why Health Canada recommends regular workouts as part of its strategy to protect against the H1N1 virus. But how can you avoid the flu at the gym? Aren't shared equipment and a sweaty population prime breeding grounds for a virus experts say has reached pandemic status?</p>
<p>"You're more likely to get the flu from the guy on the treadmill next to you than from the treadmill itself," says Dalius Briedis, an infectious-disease specialist at the McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>H1N1 is predominantly transferred from individual to individual by aerosol droplets in the air, which means being coughed on by someone beside you is the most likely way for the flu to be transmitted. So, the first step in staying healthy is asking exercisers to avoid the gym when they are sick.</p>
<p>That said, Briedis notes it is possible for the virus to stay viable for a short period on a hard surface such as fitness equipment. Therefore, it's prudent to take extra precautions when using equipment that is passed from one exerciser to the next, like cardio and weight training machines, exercise balls and dumbbells.</p>
<p>"If you come in contact with the virus and then touch your face, nose or eyes, it's possible to get the flu," Briedis explains.</p>
<p>Wiping down equipment with a cleaning solution after use, draping a clean towel over an exercise mat or bench and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after a workout should be standard practice in gyms across the country.</p>
<p>But gym rats aren't the only exercisers who need to take special precautions when it comes to avoiding the flu. Sport teams are also at increased risk of exposure to the H1N1 virus, says Briedis.</p>
<p>The proximity of athletes to each other and to their personal belongings makes the virus easy to pass along from one teammate to the next.</p>
<p>"In the winter of 1918-19, the Stanley Cup playoffs were cancelled due to an outbreak of the Spanish flu," Briedis says.</p>
<p>"Four Montreal Canadiens got sick and one died."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the H1N1 virus has been linked to only a small number of fatalities worldwide and, for the most part, results in a moderate fever, fatigue, aches and pains, which in a healthy population means spending a few days in bed recuperating. But that doesn't mean it should be treated lightly by teams and leagues across the country.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends quarantining athletes until they are symptom-free (no coughing or fever) for 24 hours. If athletes get sick on the road, they should be put in private rooms and wear masks during the bus ride home, while sitting as far away from teammates as possible.</p>
<p>The same goes for the sick athlete's roommate, who should be kept under a watchful eye for three days before being placed back on the playing roster.</p>
<p>If the flu does strike, the decision to exercise or compete is probably moot as fever, aches and pains will relegate all but the hardiest to bed until the symptoms abate. The average time to recuperate is three to seven days, after which exercisers are encouraged to get back in the game or gym slowly.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends waiting for 24 hours after fever has abated before resuming light exercise.</p>
<p>A body recuperating from flu is quick to fatigue, so respect bodily signals and take it easy if you feel less than 100 per cent during your workout.</p>
<p>Precautions should also be taken before exercising in the cold, especially if your flu symptoms include a cough. Cold air can further irritate already inflamed bronchial pathways, causing a rebound case of bronchitis and another couple of days in bed.</p>
<p>Once you feel up to speed, go ahead and resume your normal workouts.</p>
<p>Exercise is still the best medicine for a healthy mind and body.</p>

</div><div>Scott Nowoselski   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>592 words</div><div>3 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>It's going to be tough for children at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario to sit on Santa's knee this year after the jolly old elf's pre-Christmas visit was cancelled due to H1N1 fears.</p>
<p>In its place, children will receive a 'personalized' video e-mail from Santa, where the big guy will read off their name, hometown and Christmas list before wishing them a Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>CHEO events specialist Marie Belanger said the tough decision was made weeks ago, when the H1N1 crisis was at its worst.</p>
<p>"We just couldn't have Santa Claus going from room to room," she said. "It's a infection control and prevention problem for us. We had so many children in isolation at that time, we couldn't have him going from one room to another. He would have had to gown up and stuff, so it really was a logistical problem."</p>
<p>Instead of having him visit their rooms, children will now see Santa through e-mails produced by the Portable North Pole website designed by Sympatico.ca. Parents or hospital workers will fill out children's personal information online, including name, age and e-mail address, before the site produces a digital message from the big guy himself.</p>
<p>Once children receive the e-mail, they can forward it to friends or share it on Twitter or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, something Belanger hopes will increase its popularity with the web generation.</p>
<p>University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown said that while canceling Santa's visit might seem like an extreme reaction, it's likely in the best interest of everyone involved.</p>
<p>"It sounds like a bit of an overreaction, but it seems like they really do want to reduce the possibility of spreading disease," he said. "I guess they're just being extra-cautious and it's tough to fault them unless they stir people up too much."</p>
<p>Brown added that children are often more susceptible to catching respiratory infections than adults, and the decision to restrict visitors is a move that is happening across the board at children's hospitals, not just with the jolly old elf. Only parents and close relatives are encouraged to visit children at CHEO.</p>
<p>Belanger said that she was hopeful children would respond as positively to the e-mail system as they had to the in-person visits of the past, and added that workers will "play up" the system in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Belanger further said that the hospital is optimistic Santa will drop by closer to Christmas.</p>
<p>"Chances are pretty good Santa will visit" closer to Christmas, she said. "With things pretty much returning to normal now, we thought we'd play it safe with the pre-visit, but chances are he'll be back."</p>
<p>Brown agreed that with the current state of H1N1 in Ottawa, Santa should not pose any sort of health threat moving forward.</p>
<p>"I think as long as you're not seeing Santa Claus do a lot of activity, you'll be fine," he said. "No doubt they're going to talk to him and put some plans in place, so I think it will be fine."</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Santa Claus won't be jingling though the halls of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario this year.</p>
<p>With the facility still on strict infection watch in the wake of an overwhelming wave of H1N1 cases, the hospital will bring personalized video messages from St. Nicholas to sick children instead of Santa's traditional bedside visits.</p>
<p>"We want to spread the joy, not the germs," hospital spokeswoman Marie Belanger said. Normally, Santa pops in to spread Yuletide cheer to the 156 kids in hospital beds.</p>
<p>The video messages will have photos of the child and Santa's reassurance that desired toys will arrive.</p>

</div><div>Larry Moko  </div>

<p>Everything is coming up Rosenkranz for the McMaster Marauders.</p>
<p>Sparked by the solid all-around play of freshman sensation Nicole Rosenkranz, McMaster defeated the Toronto Varsity Blues 83-71 in an Ontario University Athletics women's basketball game last night.</p>
<p>That outcome, at the Burridge Gym, improved Mac's West Division record to 5-3. Toronto slipped to 4-5 in the East.</p>
<p>A 6-foot forward from Niagara Falls' Saint Paul High School, Rosenkranz poured in 25 points and grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds. She also was credited with four steals and two assists.</p>
<p>"Nicole came up with a big game," McMaster coach Theresa Burns said. "For a rookie, that's really impressive. I think she's a front-runner for rookie of the year ... but that's obviously a biased opinion. Her numbers are rivalling some of the best veterans in the league."</p>
<p>Rosenkranz, whose father Ralf was a two-sport star at Mac in football and basketball, sank 7-0f-10 shots from the field and was 11-of-15 from the free-throw line.</p>
<p>It was Rosenkranz who kick-started the Marauders with her play under the glass after the Blues had raced to a 12-0 lead. But that effort didn't surprise Burns, who has seen Rosenkranz do it before at the high school level and with Hamilton Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p>"If you need her to take over a game and put the team on her shoulders, she'll do it. And it will be done in different ways. Sometime it will be pretty, sometime it will be with guts and effort."</p>
<p>Mac caught the Blues by the end of the first quarter (17-17) and took a 42-36 lead into the intermission. By the end of the third, the Marauder advantage was 67-50.</p>
<p>Eight unanswered points by Nicki Schutz put the Blues back into the contest late in the fourth quarter before a bucket by Rosenkranz stopped the bleeding.</p>
<p>"It's a lot more fast-paced than high school ball," Rosenkranz said of her debut season. "There's still lots of stuff I have to work on. I've had to change my game to fit the university style."</p>
<p>The other top scorers for Mac were Rebecca Rewi, with 14 points, and Taylor Chiarot, with 10. The Blues' Schutz finished with 25 points and nine rebounds.</p>
<p>"We had a really bad start," Burns said. "I'm glad we didn't cave in, though. We fought our way back and built a lead of our own.</p>
<p>"The tale of our team this year is we haven't played 40 minutes in a game yet. We're still really casual with the ball and casual with cuts. There's no sense of urgency in what we're doing ... at least not for ( a full)40 minutes."</p>
<p>The loss was the third straight for Toronto, which had to postpone its games against Mac and Lakehead a few weeks ago when the H1N1 flu affected some of the players. "It's tough," said Toronto coach Michele Belanger. "We're losing because of different things. Tonight, I was disappointed with our inability to defend the drive."</p>
<p>Mac won't return to action until the Dec. 29-31 Concordia tournament.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Details of who H1N1 is sending to hospitals and who it is killing show how different this flu virus is from seasonal influenza, the head of the Public Health of Canada said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said that, where seasonal flu mainly kills the elderly, the pandemic virus is taking its worst toll on those far down the age spectrum.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones used median ages -- the midway point between the youngest and oldest person affected -- to draw the comparison.</p>
<p>As of Nov. 21, the median age of a person hospitalized with H1N1 in Canada is 26 years old. That's 45 years younger than the median age of people hospitalized during the 2007-08 flu season, he said.</p>
<p>And the median age of people admitted to ICUs in the country is 45 years old -- 23 years younger than the median age of 68 seen in the 2007 flu season.</p>
<p>The median age of Canadians who have died from H1N1 infections is 54 years old, compared to the median age of 82 from that earlier flu season.</p>
<p>To date, 329 people have died from H1N1 infections.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of them have had medical conditions that increased their risk of death, but one-third did not.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said children under five years old have had the highest rate of admission to ICUs with this flu, followed by adults 45 to 64.</p>
<p>He warned it is too soon to know if Canada is past the peak of this wave of infection, though it appears there has been a plateauing of transmission in most parts of the country.</p>
