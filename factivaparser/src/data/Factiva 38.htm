<p>Second wave hits</p>
<p>Ottawa Tuesday issued flu-preparedness guidelines for Canadians as the second wave of H1N1 arrived on the West Coast last week, claiming one life and bringing the national death toll to 79.</p>
<p>So far this fall, 64 people have been hospitalized with severe H1N1 symptoms in B.C., said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq via teleconference from Iqaluit.</p>
<p>H1N1 Preparedness Guides are available at www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca] or by calling 1-800-O-Canada.</p>

</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>

</p>
<p>Education Minister Peter Bjornson has ordered school divisions to begin immediately posting online the level of absence for each school on a daily basis -- either a message of no unusual absenteeism, or higher than usual absenteeism.</p>
<p>Bjornson's letter sent out Tuesday does not define unusual absenteeism, nor does it make any reference to the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Bjornson announced two weeks ago that divisions would have to provide daily updates of absenteeism on their websites, but only put it in writing Tuesday.</p>
<p>So far in the city, only Pembina Trails School Division had been posting a daily update of school-by-school absences 10 per cent above the seasonal norms. And to date, none has had that many students absent.</p>
<p>That 10-per-cent-above-usual figure was previously to have triggered schools alerting their public health nurse, but Bjornson's letter emphasizes that schools must post publicly anything above normal absences.</p>
<p>School divisions had been slow to respond until they got orders in writing from Bjornson, and what had been posted so far varied widely.</p>
<p>Interlake School Division listed all its schools and said it will indicate if any exceed 10 per cent absenteeism.</p>
<p>Seven Oaks School Division has a flu pandemic link on its home page, which says Seven Oaks will go public if a school exceeds seasonal norms in absences three consecutive days.</p>
<p>Louis Riel division superintendent Terry Borys has a note on the division's home page -- titled "Do you have ConFLUsion?" -- notifying parents that LRSD won't be posting anything until Bjornson tells educators in writing what he wants them to do.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, says Borys, the division has not had any confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>Superintendents met Sept. 23 with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, which reiterated earlier messages from the province that health authorities will handle the release of all flu information -- which would not include identifying an individual school in any way.</p>
<p>As Borys wrote on Louis Riel's website: "We understood that the Province (and in particular Manitoba Health) would communicate when influenza is circulating in public schools. Indeed, we were told that when we start to get cases of H1N1, that we should all avoid providing detailed information about specific student numbers or schools and give the main message that influenza has arrived, and what that means to all schools."</p>
<p>But when the Free Press reported last month that school divisions would not be publicly identifying any unusual health problems at individual schools in the face of a possible flu pandemic, there was strong reader reaction demanding information.</p>
<p>And when Premier Gary Doer later that day went on CJOB radio and said that, as a parent, he'd want to know if there was flu in his child's school, Bjornson announced a change in policy within a few hours.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, St. James-Assiniboia, River East Transcona and Seine River have been posting only the Manitoba Health messages and links that were issued months ago. Just outside the city, Sunrise and Lord Selkirk have done the same.</p>
<p>nick.martin@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>What minister says</p>
<p>WHAT Education Minister Peter Bjornson is telling school divisions to publish each day on their websites:</p>
<p>"....post one of the following messages for each school in the division, on their division website as soon as possible, depending on the circumstances that day:</p>
<p>No unusual absenteeism reported.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Higher than usual absenteeism reported</p>
<p>AS OF (date/time)"</p>
<p>Bjornson said the following should also be posted:</p>
<p>"When a report of unusual absenteeism is received, the school contacts public health for expert advice and direction. Public health will tell the school if any changes need to be made to reduce the spread of infection, and the school will inform parents of these recommended changes.</p>
<p>"It is important to note that absenteeism reports may not be because of the flu. Absenteeism may be related to other medical or non-medical reasons.</p>
<p>For more information on how to reduce your risk of H1N1 flu, visit www.manitoba.ca/flu[http://www.manitoba.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/flu]."</p>
<p>Bjornson also told school divisions that while he expects them to let public health know the reasons for absences, "There is no requirement to include specific information on the website about the percentage of students away, number of students away, reasons for absenteeism, or other attendance data."</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Dissent over Canada's H1N1 vaccination strategy continues to quietly mount in the country's medical community as the top public health official said the government will temporarily leave nearly one million doses of the vaccine on the shelf till early November.</p>
<p>The decision to hold off on doses that are now ready comes at a time when the pandemic flu is on the rise in places like British Columbia and high-risk individuals across the country could face severe disease and little protection.</p>
<p>Other countries, including the United States, Australia and China, have already begun inoculating their populations against the swine-flu virus.</p>
<p>Some health experts fear that the late rollout in Canada could come just as the virus starts peaking – and that the vaccine, awaiting regulatory approval, will do little to save those groups most vulnerable to the influenza pandemic, including pregnant women. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the vaccine needs to be tested for its safety and effectiveness before being rolled out to Canadians. “Immunizing a small number of people will not stop the effects of the pandemic,” he said.</p>
<p>Pressed by reporters on Canada immunizing its citizens in early November instead of sooner, he responded: “There is no delay. The vaccine is just starting to come out of quality-testing. Provinces and territories are doing all the work to put it in place. So that rather than piecemeal, you can deliver an effective vaccine campaign for the whole country.”</p>
<p>Anand Kumar, an intensive-care specialist at Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre, acknowledged that rolling out the vaccine piecemeal won't stop the pandemic. “But it will protect the highest-risk people from getting severe disease,” he argued.</p>
<p>Dr. Kumar co-authored a Canadian study in the Journal of the American Medical Association that revealed that a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy women fell critically ill and died of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>The study found that a large majority of those who became seriously ill had no serious underlying health conditions. Two-thirds of patients admitted to Canadian intensive-care units were women, and the average age was 32. That is in stark contrast to seasonal flu, which mainly burdens the elderly.</p>
<p>“Personally, I don't feel that a lot of testing is warranted given the fact that this is a variation of vaccines that have been used for the last 10 years,” Dr. Kumar said. “The faster we get the vaccine out and get the communities covered, the better we're going to do.”</p>
<p>Canada's vaccine, produced by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> at its plant in Ste-Foy, Que., has yet to be approved by Health Canada – and it won't be distributed until the approval process is complete, even though that is considered largely a formality. Ottawa has ordered 50 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine from GSK.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones hinted that Canadians could be offered the H1N1 vaccine at the end of this month, if Health Canada moves through the regulatory hurdles quickly. But he said the first week of November is still the target date for the vaccine launch.</p>
<p>While other countries are rolling out non-adjuvant vaccine, Canada has decided to fortify its vaccine with adjuvants, which are chemical boosters that can increase production. Adjuvants are in many common vaccines in Canada, but have not previously been approved for influenza vaccines.</p>
<p>But components of the vaccine have been proven to be safe: The adjuvant has been tested on thousands with the H5N1 avian flu drug, and the antigen has been tested in other trials in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones said the early November timeline is based on the availability of the vaccine and the ability of provinces and territories to smoothly move from administering seasonal flu shots to the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The Health Minister, he said, will authorize the use of the vaccine once there is sufficient evidence on its safety. Results from further clinical trials will be released later this week.</p>
<p>About 4,500 people worldwide have died of H1N1, including 79 in Canada. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, but many countries have stopped counting cases because the disease is so widespread.</p>

<p>The Astana team of Tour de France winner Alberto Contador and third-place Lance Armstrong is the target of a probe after suspicious medical material was seized during this year's race, a source close to the investigation said.</p>
<p>Several teams are being investigated, but French police are particularly interested in Astana after syringes and transfusion material were found in a container used by the Kazakh-funded team to dump medical waste during the last four stages of this year's race.</p>
<p>Village a virus breeding ground?</p>
<p>Olympic athletes should be among the first to be vaccinated against the deadly H1N1 flu virus, Canada's team doctor said Tuesday, amid fears an outbreak may spoil the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.</p>
<p>"The Olympic Games is a global virus get-together," Bob McCormack told CBC. "If you have hundreds of countries getting together with thousands of athletes in a small, contained area of the village, it's a breeding ground for viruses."</p>
<p>However, Canada's health minister, Leona Aglukkaq, has already indicated she will not make vaccinating Olympic athletes a priority.</p>
<p>Ski champ Gut unlikely for Games</p>
<p>Switzerland's 18-year-old skiing prodigy Lara Gut looks doubtful for this February's Winter Olympics following an operation on a dislocated right hip, her father said.</p>
<p>"Lara will be able to get back on her skis in January," Pauli Gut, who is also her coach, said. "The Games? We are not thinking about them. The priority is her health."</p>
<p>Gut became the youngest skier (17 years, 237 days) to win a World Cup race last December. She was a double silver medallist at the world championships in February.</p>
<p>Samaranch has heart attack</p>
<p>Former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, 89, suffered a mild heart attack and was taken to hospital in Monaco as a precaution.</p>
<p>Roddick injures knee</p>
<p>Andy Roddick's injury-enforced withdrawal from the Shanghai Masters graphically illustrated the American's gripes about the relentless demands placed on the world's best tennis players.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old, who on Monday said the governing ATP must give players a proper offseason or risk shortening the careers of its billboard names, went out with a knee injury against Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wozni collision course</p>
<p>Aleksandra Wozniak of Blainville, Que., won her opening round match at the HP Open in Osaka, downing Australian qualifier Sophie Ferguson 6-1, 7-5.</p>
<p>In Thursday's round of 16, Wozniak, seeded sixth in the tournament, will face Kai-Chen Chang of Taiwan, another qualifier. A win for Wozniak could set up a quarterfinal clash with similarly named rival Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, the world No. 6.</p>

<p>Federal health department officials on Tuesday said they would begin distributing 1.2 million manuals offering pointers on combating swine flu in anticipation of the flu season.</p>
<p>The "comprehensive preparedness guide" aims to provide Canadians with information about the swine flu virus, steps to protect themselves against it, and tips on what to do if they or their family members get sick.</p>
<p>"Every Canadian has a role to play in preventing the spread of the H1N1 flu virus," said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>Developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the guide will be sent directly to health-care professionals and organizations supporting at-risk populations, such as people with underlying medical conditions, young children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>Canadians also will be able to obtain copies at post offices.</p>
<p>Ottawa also is mailing to some 13.7 million homes pamphlets with basic information on the swine flu virus, which has so far killed 79 people in Canada.</p>
<p>- Canada has less than a million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine ready for distribution, not enough to move up the start of its vaccination program, chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Country-wide vaccination remains on track to begin in the first week of November, he said.</p>
<p>"It's a huge undertaking, so we want to get it right," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Lately, there has been a lot of talk about flu vaccinations with one article suggesting that two vaccines may be the best defence against the seasonal flu and H1N1. The choice of whether to be vaccinated against the flu or not should belong to every individual since it concerns their respective bodies. Hopefully, people can and will make informed decisions about such things.</p>
<p>It is a known scientific fact that many pathogens enter the body through the respiratory tract or the gastrointestinal tract. Vaccinations, of course, attempt to bypass this by injecting dead or weakened viruses into muscle tissue in an effort to stimulate the body's B-cells to go to work and produce immunity. Some have argued that vaccination is an abnormal entrance for such organisms into the body. This, in turn, occasionally produces abnormal reactions. Perhaps, for this and other reasons, pharmaceutical firms are now working on manufacturing vaccines that will be inhaled.</p>
<p>Additionally, contrary to accepted thinking, some scientific studies have shown that influenza does not actually result from person to person transmission of the flu virus.</p>
<p>But, instead, comes to people during the fall and winter months when the sun is not shining as often and vitamin D levels in humans tend to go down. While this is not mainstream thinking in the medical community, the idea does merit further examination and study.</p>
<p>Some health practitioners believe that healthy vitamin D levels can help boost the immune system to help protect against influenza.</p>
<p>There appears to be much that medical science does not yet know about the flu and more study needs to be done. One thing is for certain; people keeping their immune systems healthy and strong is always a good idea.</p>

</p>
<p>A "striking" proportion of severe swine flu infections are occurring among young women, according to Canadian research.</p>
<p>The research has found that severe H1N1 can hit previously healthy teens and young adults hard and fast in a pattern previously only seen with the 1918 Spanish flu.</p>
<p>Severe disease and death in the outbreak is concentrated in relatively healthy people, ages 10 to 60, the study found. Only 30 per cent had serious underlying health problems, such as cancer, chronic kidney failure or medication-dependent diabetes.</p>
<p>"Seventy per cent of them would have said to you, 'I'm pretty healthy.' I think that's pretty startling, quite frankly," said Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensivist with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and an associate professor of critical care and infectious disease at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>The study found that of the 113 women and 55 men admitted to an intensive care unit between April and August, the mean age was 32. Overall, 29 people (17 per cent) died -- most within the first 14 days after becoming critically sick. Twenty-one (72 per cent) of those who died were female.</p>
<p>"It's a high mortality rate for young people," Kumar said. "When you bear in mind that these are people from the age of 15 to 55 years old, you don't see a lot of diseases that have that kind of mortality in a large group of people that age. These people are people in the prime of their lives."</p>
<p>Another study, also released yesterday, found an H1N1 death rate more than twice as high in Mexico. By 60 days, 24 of the 58 patients (41 per cent) admitted to intensive care with H1N1 in the Mexican study had died.</p>
<p>The major difference between Mexico and Canada is access to high-tech care, Kumar said.</p>
<p>But there were similarities in the findings from both countries, investigators said. Once admitted to hospital, people with severe H1N1 rapidly got worse, suffering severe hypoxemia -- lower than normal oxygen in the blood -- that required, on average, 12 days of mechanical ventilation and "rescue" therapies to keep them alive. One such therapy is a machine that takes blood out of the body, oxygenates it and returns it to the body, similar to a bypass machine for heart surgery.</p>
<p>"Unlike [heart] surgery, when you do this for a couple of hours, some of these guys required it for a week or two weeks, or longer," said Kumar. "Rescue therapies are therapies that we use when we've got nothing else left," he said. They are also not widely available in Canada.</p>
<p>Shock and multiple organ failure were also common in the sickest patients.</p>
<p>As to why women are disproportionately hit, "nobody knows," Kumar said. In most infectious disease, males make up a larger proportion of cases, and have a higher death rate.</p>
<p>The study, by the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, included adults and children treated at 38 hospitals across Canada.</p>

<p>With both flu season and its attendant H1N1 anxiety upon us, a new study has suggested a startling possible factor in the high death toll from the 1918-'19 pandemic that is often referred to in stories about the current threat: The misuse of Aspirin.</p>
<p>"In 1918, physicians did not fully understand either the dosing or pharmacology of Aspirin, yet they were willing to recommend it," says study author Karen Starko on the Infectious Diseases Society of America website.</p>
<p>"Its use was promoted by the drug industry, endorsed by doctors wanting to 'do something,' and accepted by families and institutions desperate for hope."</p>
<p>The study observes that "high Aspirin dosing levels used to treat patients during the 1918-'1919 pandemic are now known to cause, in some cases, toxicity and a dangerous build up of fluid in the lungs, which may have contributed to the incidence and severity of symptoms, bacterial infections and mortality."</p>
<p>That finding has particular resonance in a season filled with stories about the debatable timing of both regular flu and H1N1 vaccines.</p>
<p>"Interventions cut both ways," Starko reminds. "Medicines can save and improve our lives. Yet we must be ever mindful of the importance of dose, of balancing benefits and risks, and of the limitations of our studies."</p>

<p>A "striking" number of women are becoming seriously ill after contracting H1N1, according to a new study, and researchers admit they have no explanation.</p>
<p>Although it's been known that pregnant women, the young and elderly are at increased risk, the authors of the report, Critically Ill Patients With 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Infection in Canada, write "the tendency of females to develop severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in this series is striking," especially since "female susceptibility has not been observed" in other influenza outbreaks.</p>
<p>And they can't say why.</p>
<p>"The explanation for increased risk of severe disease and death among females in this report is unclear," the authors write, "but the role of pregnancy as a risk factor has been noted in previous influenza pandemics."</p>
<p>About 67 per cent of the cases studied in the Canadian report were women.</p>
<p>The study also found in one survey of 168 critically ill patients, 29 died - the majority in two weeks. The majority of the deaths, 72 per cent, were women.</p>
<p>Similar results were found last month after the Montreal public health department tracked cases from April to September, and found about 56 per cent of the 1,280 confirmed cases of H1N1 were women. In hospital, women were twice as likely as men to develop complications or die, the study found.</p>
<p>The authors of the Critically Ill report also found Canadians in their 30s are most susceptible to contracting H1N1, and stress that, once admitted to hospital, they require rapid admission to critical care and aggressive treatment.</p>
<p>"In the Canadian context we found these were young patients, much younger than we would usually imagine treating flu patients in the ICU," said Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical care physician at Sunnybrook hospital and the lead author of the study published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>He said the two most "surprising," results in the Canadian study were the relatively low age of patients and the number of patients who required aggressive treatment, including ventilation, signalling the need to properly prepare for the second wave this fall.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health hot topic for new session; McMorris expected to face questioning when MLAs return</b>
</div><div>James Wood </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>1161 words</div><div>13 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>During the years, the job of health minister in Saskatchewan has come with an accessory -- the proverbial hot seat.</p>
<p>But for the Saskatchewan Party government's Don McMorris, the health minister's chair in the legislature chamber has been more like a big comfy couch as he's faced relatively little fire from the NDP Opposition.</p>
<p>With the fall legislative session beginning in less than two weeks, however, that appears to be changing.</p>
<p>At the end of a government caucus retreat in September, Premier Brad Wall said health would be a renewed priority, with stubbornly long waiting lists a major concern.</p>
<p>And newly installed NDP Leader Dwain Lingenfelter also said health care would be one of the top priorities for what is expected to be a newly aggressive Opposition.</p>
<p>Setting the tone for the debate will be the government's much-ballyhooed "patient-first review" of the health system, chaired by veteran health administrator Tony Dagnone, which is expected to be released before the legislature sitting starts on Oct. 21.</p>
<p>Opposition health critic Judy Junor said the wait for the review has played a role in the NDP's relative silence on health issues since the November 2007 provincial election.</p>
<p>But she acknowledged that after 16 years of NDP rule and stinging attacks from McMorris and the Sask. Party on health issues, the NDP still retained a certain political ownership of problems within the system.</p>
<p>"That's over," she said in a recent interview. "He's the minister; he's been the minister for two years. It's on his watch. He needs to step up. Saying that I didn't or we didn't, nobody cares about that. It isn't the answer people need and it certainly isn't something they are going to accept."</p>
<p>Junor -- who in recent weeks has been vocal in criticizing the government on its state of preparedness for the H1N1 flu -- said there will be many more questions aimed at the government on health.</p>
<p>Key issues will be wait times for surgeries and other health procedures, which Junor describes as basically unchanged under the Saskatchewan Party, and a shortage of doctors, which she says has become more acute. After calling for a seniors' bill of rights this summer, the health issues of seniors will also be an NDP priority.</p>
<p>Junor said that with the number of health issues being raised by the public it would be easy to emulate the Sask. Party's own tactics in Opposition of bringing health-care horror stories to the legislature but she would not say if that will happen.</p>
<p>For his part, McMorris said he fully expects to be on his feet a great deal more often during question period, but he welcomes taking on the NDP over health issues.</p>
<p>"If they want to go there, I'd be more than glad to go there," he said.</p>
<p>McMorris said the government has a solid health record since taking office, pointing to the decision to fund the cancer drug Avastin and its goal of hiring 800 new nurses, which has been 70 per cent accomplished.</p>
<p>The Oct. 21 throne speech will address the issue of wait times -- potentially setting reduction targets -- with money and programs to follow through the session, he said.</p>
<p>"What we've been looking at first of all is trying to make sure we have a proper complement of health-care professionals and we need to do more work on the physician side for sure. There's no use trying to tackle a backlog in surgeries when you don't have enough nurses, for example," said McMorris.</p>
<p>The most recent statistics posted on the Saskatchewan Surgical Care Network website show there were 27,589 people waiting for surgeries at the end of June, with a trend line basically unchanged during the last two years.</p>
<p>While McMorris said the trend has "flattened" under the Sask. Party, the longer-term numbers are a mixed bag. According to numbers provided by the provincial health ministry, the number of patients waiting for surgeries was 30,630 in March 2004, which had dropped to 26,846 three years later under the NDP. The number of patients who waited for longer than a year for surgery was 9,756 at that time in 2004 and had dropped to 5,492 under the NDP. There has been further improvement under the Sask. Party's watch, with the number of people waiting more than a year dropping to 4,188.</p>
<p>The government's health-care recruitment website meanwhile shows 112 physician vacancies in the province compared to 102 vacancies in September, 94 in December of 2008 and 84 in the spring of 2007.</p>
<p>The Sask. Party's base has always been rural Saskatchewan and McMorris acknowledges "we're hearing it in spades" from rural communities affected by the physician shortage.</p>
<p>McMorris said the government has moved to dramatically increase spaces at the University of Saskatchewan medical school and residency positions, but he noted the long training times for physicians mean the payoff is far down the road.</p>
<p>The government has meanwhile been working on a partnership with the Saskatchewan Medical Association to try and recruit more doctors into rural areas, he said.</p>
<p>One open question is whether the patient-first review will provide a blueprint for the government to follow when it is released.</p>
<p>Dagnone was charged with looking at ways to improve the patient's experience in the health-care system and to review health administration. It remains to be seen whether that will translate into steps that will cut waiting times or fill health-care jobs.</p>
<p>McMorris -- who has seen bits and pieces of the report -- said he doesn't expect Dagnone will "dictate" to the government but that he will identify problems and make suggestions on "how to put the patient first, how to make the patient the centre."</p>
<p>But Tom McIntosh, a University of Regina political scientist who specializes in health-care issues, said health care can't be viewed as simply another consumer good.</p>
<p>While there is a great opportunity in the review to point the way to doing things better there is also a danger that it will simply prescribe more resources for the existing system, he said.</p>
<p>On the political front, McIntosh said there is little doubt the Sask. Party benefited from an NDP that was in the process of changing leaders and licking its wounds after its election loss.</p>
<p>But McIntosh said he hopes that there isn't a return to an Opposition that simply "lobs grenades" around the "crisis of the day."</p>
<p>It is time for the Sask. Party government to put forward a "substantive vision" for the health system and that is where the debate should take place, he said.</p>

<p>WORKPLACE HAZARDS / ROBBED DRUNK</p>
<p>Robbed once, you're shaken up. Robbed twice, it's old hat. So when it happens the third time, just hand over the money, right? Well, it may be better not to jump the gun, employees at a Waterloo, Iowa, convenience store recently learned. After surviving two summer robberies, clerks mistakenly threw a bag of money at a drunk man who had stumbled in off the street, Ananova.com reports. The 32-year-old man was ranting about the two previous incidents and had his hand stuffed in his pocket, leading them to think a stick-up was imminent. While the man accepted the bag, he certainly didn't have a getaway plan – police nabbed him nearby. As for the clerks, suspicion might serve them well, but having a breathalyzer handy might not be a bad idea either.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Rapidly worsening breathing problems in the sickest H1N1 flu patients in Mexico and Canada present a scary worst-case scenario and could foreshadow what doctors face as winter flu season sets in, new reports suggest.</p>
<p>In Canada, patients hospitalized with H1N1 are younger and sicker than expected, with people in their 30s most vulnerable to the illness.</p>
<p>In the global outbreak's first wave, many critically ill patients in both countries were obese, although their death rates weren't higher than others. Many in both countries also were younger than those typically hard hit by seasonal flu. Patients studied worsened quickly after being admitted to hospitals.</p>
<p>Most survived after intensive, lengthy treatment, although the death rate in Mexican patients studied - 41 per cent - was much higher.</p>
<p>The reports were published online Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>The report, Critically Ill Patients With 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Infection in Canada, showed the studied patients also required fast access to critical care and aggressive treatment, with many worsening quickly after being admitted to hospitals.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical care physician at Sunnybrook hospital and senior author on the studies said the most "surprising" results were the youth of patients and the number needing aggressive treatment.</p>
<p>The susceptibility of women to severe H1N1 flu was described by the report's authors as "striking."</p>
<p>Of 168 critical care patients with H1N1 from April to June, the mean age was 32. About 67 per cent were female; children accounted for 29 per cent, and 25 per cent were aboriginal Canadians.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine patients died, most in two weeks. Seventy-two per cent of the deaths were female. Four were children.</p>
<p>A second Canadian study, looking at patients in Mexico, suggests developing countries with few ICU beds and less advanced respiratory treatments will be in for a rough ride as the fall wave of H1N1 hits.</p>
<p>The death rate among Mexican patients was double that in Canada, with over 40 per cent of critically-ill Mexican patients dying.</p>
<p>"I think this H1N1 (virus), it's not going to be the one that people would say ‘Oh, my God, that killed off X per cent of our population,' " said Fowler.</p>
<p>"But we're going to see large numbers of patients that have illness, a subset that are critically ill and in different parts of the world it's actually going to translate into lots of people dying that wouldn't have otherwise died - especially so if you can't support them (medically)."</p>
<p>While it's not currently possible to estimate what percentage of people who catch the virus need to be hospitalized, it is clear that for most people, H1N1 is indistinguishable from regular influenza.</p>
<p>But a small proportion of patients became profoundly ill, and they did so quickly. Fowler said those who went into this sharp decline generally ended up in the ICU within about 24 hours of entering hospital.</p>
<p>These patients are far younger than those hospitals generally see dying from flu or the complications of flu, said Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensivist who treated many of these patients in Winnipeg hospitals this spring and the lead author on the Canadian study.</p>
<p>He said any loss of life in an ICU is difficult, but it is especially hard when the cases are like those this virus often kills - younger adults and middle-aged people who were relatively healthy before they contracted the virus.</p>
<p>"To lose somebody 24, 25, 30, 40 years old - it's just not their time," Kumar said.</p>
<p>Where resource-intensive therapies are available, the chances are decent that patients with H1N1 will pull through, these and other recently published studies have found.</p>
<p>But where they are not, the death toll will be higher, said Fowler, a critical care specialist at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.</p>
<p>"This is a young, relatively healthy group of patients that has their lungs fail. And if you can throw the book at them to get their lungs through this, then you have a pretty good shot at keeping them alive," Fowler said.</p>
<p>"And I think in places that aren't able to do that, well … you have a much lesser likelihood of making it."</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says anyone showing these swine flu symptoms should seek medical care immediately:</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>Fast or troubled breathing; skin turning bluish; not drinking enough fluids; being unusually hard to wake up or not interacting; being so irritable that the child doesn't want to be held; flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough; fever with a rash.</p>
<p>Adults</p>
<p>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath; pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen; severe or persistent vomiting; sudden dizziness; confusion.</p>

<p>New studies suggest developing countries with limited high-tech health care may be in for a rough ride with the swine flu.</p>
<p>The studies compare what happened to people in Canada and Mexico who ended up in intensive care units with H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>The death rate among the Mexican patients was double what was seen in Canada, with just over 40 per cent of the critically ill Mexican patients succumbing.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Fowler, the senior author of both papers, suggests the survival rates are a sign of what might happen in developing countries which have few ICU beds and less access to the advanced respiratory treatments at the disposal of the Canadian patients.</p>
<p>Fowler, a critical-care specialist, says the studies also show that patients who were given antiviral drugs were seven times more likely to survive than those who did not.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More passengers cruise through Vancouver in 2009</b>
</div><div>Fiona Anderson   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

<p>When the <span class="companylink">Celebrity Cruises</span> ship Mercury pulls anchor today it will officially mark the end of Vancouver's 2009 cruise ship season. And despite the bad news elsewhere in the tourism industry, the number of passengers going through the port was up this year compared to last.</p>
<p>Since April 24, 2009, when the first ship of the season -- Fred Olsen Cruise Line's Balmoral -- docked, 37 different cruise ships have called at <span class="companylink">Port Metro Vancouver</span> carrying about 897,000 passengers. That's 4.5 per cent more people than passed through in 2008.</p>
<p>Cruise ship lines plan their itineraries well in advance, booking spots at the port in March 2008 for the 2009 season. But unlike hotel rooms that will be left empty in a downturn, ships want a 100-per-cent occupancy rate, said Greg Wirtz, manager of trade development at <span class="companylink">Port Metro Vancouver</span>.</p>
<p>"So there are times when they have to discount the cabins to fill the ships, but they'll still fill the ships," Wirtz said.</p>
<p>So with the same number of ships scheduled to make port in 2009 as in 2008, the number of passengers should have been the same. But when the H1N1 flu broke out in Mexico, Carnival Cruise Lines turned six of its Los-Angeles-based trips 180 degrees, north to Alaska, stopping in Vancouver along the way. That added about 3,000 passengers a trip, which helped bump up the numbers, Wirtz said. Other tweaks in itineraries, which made ships call in Vancouver more often, also swelled the number of passengers.</p>
<p>Each round-trip sailing to Vancouver is estimated to bring in about $2 million to the area.</p>
<p>But next year, the port is expecting a drop of 30 per cent in the number of cruise ships passengers passing through.</p>
<p>Some cruise lines are cutting back on the number of trips to Alaska and sending ships elsewhere in the world, Wirtz said. And others are moving their home port from Vancouver to Seattle, which is a cheaper destination for American travellers.</p>
<p>As a result, less than 200 trips are booked to stop in Vancouver in 2010, down from 257 this season. That number could increase with last-minute additions, but there will still be fewer passengers, Wirtz said.</p>
<p>However, 2011 is already looking brighter as <span class="companylink">Disney</span> Cruise Line will make Vancouver its home port for 18 Alaska cruises, carrying 2,700 passengers on each. And Crystal Cruises is reviving some of its Alaska trips, which are based out of San Francisco but will have Vancouver as a port of call, Wirtz said.</p>
<p>In 2007, one of the best and longest years for the local cruise industry, more than 950,000 passengers passed through Vancouver.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health nurse feels heat in smoking community; When 60 to 80 per cent of the population use tobacco, it is difficult to deliver the message of the habit's potential harm</b>
</div><div>Andrew Duffy   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>Within days of arriving in this Nunavut hamlet to take up her duties as a community health nurse, Linda Gill began to stop smokers on the street.</p>
<p>When Gill saw a pregnant woman light up -- or a mother with a baby tucked into the hood of her amauti (traditional parka) do the same -- she would speak to them about the dangers.</p>
<p>"I would say: 'You must not smoke when your baby is in the amauti. Not even your friends should smoke beside the baby.'</p>
<p>"My husband told me I'm going to make enemies, but too bad: The health of the babies is more important," said Gill, a nursing veteran who has worked in first nations communities across northern B.C.</p>
<p>When Gill moved to Cape Dorset in March, she was shocked at the tobacco use.</p>
<p>"The research says two in three smoke, but I think it's worse than that: I think about 90 per cent of people smoke."</p>
<p>It's not unknown here for parents to buy cigarettes for their teenagers. The attitude that permits such a thing -- the belief that cigarettes are a normal part of life -- is at the very heart of Nunavut's smoking epidemic. Indeed, public health officials believe they must dislodge cigarettes from mainstream culture before smoking rates can be significantly curtailed.</p>
<p>"We're still struggling with denormalizing it," said Dr. Geraldine Osborne, Nunavut's deputy chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Smoking remains part of everyday life in Nunavut even though the territory introduced one of the country's toughest tobacco control laws five years ago. Smoking is banned in most public places, including bars, restaurants and workplaces.</p>
<p>The law, and the public outcry that accompanied it, has at least helped drive home the message that second-hand smoke is dangerous, particularly for children.</p>
<p>According to a 2007 Statistics Canada report, 68 per cent of people in Nunavut reported living in homes where smoking was banned indoors. Few imposed such a restriction a decade ago.</p>
<p>Still, the government's public health message continues to be diluted by the sheer number of smokers in Nunavut: So many use tobacco that it is still perceived as an acceptable risk.</p>
<p>"When 60 to 80 per cent of people smoke, you're surrounded by tobacco: it's accepted, it's normal," said Catherine Carry, a program officer with Inuit Tuttarvingat, of the National Aboriginal Health Organization.</p>
<p>"It will take a huge effort to turn that thinking around, the attitudes that support that. You have to change the culture of smoking."</p>
<p>That culture is a foreign one.</p>
<p>Tobacco was first introduced to Canada's Inuit by European whalers in the late 19th century. Inuit hunters later traded furs for tobacco at <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Co</span>. outposts established across the North.</p>
<p>Tobacco became a status symbol, something carefully used and shared. Then, in the early 1960s, after the once nomadic Inuit settled in communities, cigarettes became an integral part of the new lifestyle.</p>
<p>Today, among the territory's large youth population -- 35 per cent of residents are under the age of 15 -- peer pressure also exerts a strong gravitational pull. Many consider smoking a rite of passage into adulthood.</p>
<p>"They want to join their friends and they're not aware of the critical health effects, so we're trying to get our message into the schools," said Nunavut Health Minister Tagak Curley. "How well we do with the youth is a big challenge."</p>
<p>Nunavut has introduced a tobacco reduction program that uses schools and health clinics to target expectant mothers and youth.</p>
<p>But Curley knows he must enlist parents if the campaign is to succeed. Young people need to see parents and role models give up cigarettes, then talk about it.</p>
<p>"That's where I say as a government we have not communicated that message effectively enough to the parents first: they need to appreciate that it is a dangerous substance, that it should be discouraged for their children," said Curley.</p>
<p>Lennie Sapach, the nurse in charge of Cape Dorset's health centre, is the hamlet's senior resident health official. In five years here, she has seen painful evidence of the epidemic: chronic obstructive lung disease, chronic heart disease, pneumonia, lung cancer.</p>
<p>Nurses regularly teach prenatal and high school classes about the effects of smoking.</p>
<p>Sapach tells expectant mothers: "When you have this beautiful little baby in your arms, are you going to put a cigarette to their mouths and offer them a drag? Because that's what you're doing when you smoke: it goes through their blood system."</p>
<p>The message, however, has not made a dent in the addiction rate among expectant mothers, she says.</p>
<p>"We haven't been successful," admits Sapach. "It's not something that's easy. Teaching over and over, you eventually hope the next generation will pick up on that."</p>
<p>Community health representative Martha Jaw, a Cape Dorset elder, knows how difficult it is to break the habit.</p>
<p>She began smoking at age 11 and continued for 30 years. During those decades, she often thought about quitting, but each time she entertained the notion, she ended up smoking more. Finally, with the help of her religious faith, she managed to quit in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>She encourages young people to find a reason in their own lives to break their addiction.</p>
<p>"You've got to want to quit," she tells them. "I gave my life to Jesus. That was my purpose and it worked. Your purpose, what you believe in, will help you stop."</p>
<p>Cape Dorset's anti-smoking campaign remains in its infancy. Community health nurses offer smokers the chance to go on a nicotine patch, but few seize the opportunity.</p>
<p>"We're up against a huge, huge enemy," said Sapach, "and I think we're a generation behind."</p>
<p>Cape Dorset is one of 26 Nunavut communities spread over of 1.9 million square kilometres, an area almost three times the size of Texas. The capital, Iqaluit, is home to the territory's only hospital.</p>
<p>Delivering health care and public health programs over such a vast territory comes with enormous challenges.</p>
<p>About one-third of health department jobs have remained unfilled for most of the past decade. Vacancy rates for professional positions are even higher. Few professionals stay for long: in 10 years, for example, the department has had nine deputy ministers.</p>
<p>That makes it difficult to sustain strong public health programs, or to build the kind of personal relationships that make them successful in small communities.</p>
<p>Like other programs, the territory's campaign against smoking has suffered from a lack of continuity.</p>
<p>Catherine Carry has worked to reduce smoking rates in the North for 15 years. But most programs, she says, are financed on a short-term basis.</p>
<p>But local health committees often regard other issues, such as the high rates of alcoholism, drug addiction and suicide, as more important than smoking.</p>
<p>In Cape Dorset, nurse Linda Gill organized a community meeting to discuss the hamlet's smoking problem in late May. She hoped to launch a smoking support group.</p>
<p>Sadly, two people committed suicide and a third attempted suicide the same week that Gill had organized the public meeting. Only one person in the town of 1,200 attended the anti-smoking event.</p>
<p>What's more, she said, her time has been consumed by an outbreak of H1N1 and in working with several young people who had turned to gas-sniffing. More recently, small fires were set under the town's health care clinic and nurses' residence.</p>
<p>Although Gill's self-help group for smokers was never launched, she continues to discuss quitting strategies with interested clients. She's had some success. One person has quit smoking for two months and five others are on nicotine patches as they try to break their addiction.</p>

</p>
<p>When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.</p>
<p>Or, in the case of three young Calgary women, when life hands you symptoms of the H1N1 virus, make headbands.</p>
<p>When friends Kelby Price, 21, and Courtney Sokal, 24, came down with nasty flu symptoms this July, they were told to quarantine themselves for a week. But within a couple of days they were feeling better (they didn't have the H1N1 virus), and were looking for something to do. Courtney's younger sister Vanessa, 19, joined them and they got down to business-- creating a business, that is.</p>
<p>"We were bored, so we started making headbands," Price says. "After we got out of quarantine, people started noticing the headbands we were wearing."</p>
<p>The ornate, handmade headbands attracted so much attention that the trio decided to test the market with a booth at a figure skating competition in Edmonton a few weeks later.</p>
<p>"We thought, 'What a perfect target market,' Price says.</p>
<p>They were right. One hundred headbands later, the friends knew they were onto something.</p>
<p>Why headbands? "We all love headbands. I wear one every day," Price says. "But there's not a lot out there."</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of the accessory, the trio noticed a huge gap in the market. There were high-end headbands for $180 at <span class="companylink">Holt Renfrew</span> or low-end headbands at drug stores --and nothing in between.</p>
<p>Price is in her fourth year of a commerce degree, Courtney is a third-year business student and Vanessa is a financial whiz who's taking general studies, so it didn't take long for the three to come up with a business plan.</p>
<p>They set out to make gorgeous, one-of-a-kind headbands for all ages priced between $12 and $24, and called their company Freda Loves Porter.</p>
<p>"We were thinking about brands we aspire to be like and they all had some meaning behind them," Price says.</p>
<p>Her grandma had recently passed away, so they chose her maiden name, Porter, and combined it with the Sokals' grandmother's first name, Freda, to create Freda Loves Porter.</p>
<p>The group buys wholesale headbands and ribbon and searches vintage and second-hand stores across the province to find adornments for its creations.</p>
<p>"We use feathers, zippers, shells, birds (fake ones)," Price says. "We have pretty much anything you can imagine."</p>
<p>Using glue guns and epoxy, the women piece together their headbands, with each one taking anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes.</p>
<p>"It's a lot of hard work and blisters on our hands," Price says. "We try to make every one one-of-a-kind and something you're not going to get somewhere else."</p>
<p>Their strategy appears to be working. After attending a few more events, including Portobello West Market, and opening an online store ( fredalovesporter.com),they've sold more than 1,000 headbands and have 11 stores interested in carrying their product. You could say Freda Loves Porter headbands are flying off the shelves, but it would be more accurate to say that they're flying off their heads.</p>
<p>"We'll be wearing them and people will be like, 'Oh my gosh, I love your headband!' " Price says. "Courtney works at Second Cup and sells 10 a day."</p>
<p>Spur-of-the-moment sales are so common that the women carry headbands with them at all times.</p>
<p>"People will want to buy the one right off our heads if we don't have extras," Price says.</p>
<p>They've even started making custom headwear for weddings.</p>
<p>"When it started to get overwhelmingly busy, we sat down and decided we need to figure out what each of us is really good at," Price says. "We all have different strengths."</p>
<p>Vanessa is great at tying bows and taking care of the finances, while Courtney is the master when it comes to wrapping the bands with ribbon and doing beadwork. Kelby's strength is devising new concepts.</p>
<p>They have work bees nearly every night and often go on working retreats for the weekend.</p>
<p>"On weekends, we'll go to my cabin in Sylvan Lake and bring boxes and boxes of ribbon," Price says. "We all work and go to school. It's like: school, work, headbands."</p>
<p>It's not just about headbands, though.</p>
<p>"We envision it being a brand, so we want to eventually move past headbands," Price says. "But we have to start with a core demographic. We want to see our headbands in stores like <span class="companylink">Holt Renfrew</span>, stores nationwide."</p>
<p>At the base of it all, is their love of fashion.</p>
<p>"We're girlie-girls," Price says. We love the ease of headbands. If your hair isn't done, just throw a headband on and it looks fine." A solution for tricky</p>
<p>tresses? These girls are definitely onto</p>
<p>something.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Let's get the H1N1 vaccine to all</b>
</div><div>Anna Bishop   </div>
<div>664 words</div><div>13 October 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>I'm sure you've heard about the H1N1 pandemic. How could you not? It's been on the news, in the papers and on the radio. But aside from washing your hands more often, how much have you really thought about it? What are its implications, not just for us, but from a global standpoint?</p>
<p>H1N1 is a mix of bird, swine, and human flu all in one. I recently started reading up on its symptoms and found myself wondering, ‘What's the big deal? This just sounds like the normal flu.' And technically, it isn't a big deal. Yet.</p>
<p>There are two reasons H1N1 has gathered so much attention. First, it's highly contagious, having spread across most of the world in about a year. As well, H1N1 has an extremely high probability of morphing into something much more lethal. These facts have moved scientists, corporations and governments to act.</p>
<p>The United States alone has stockpiled 600 million doses of vaccine for this flu. Canada, Australia, Brazil, France, New Zealand, China, Switzerland, the U.K. - across the globe, countries are doing likewise, at least developed nations. Is this a coincidence?</p>
<p>No. Millions of vaccines come with a steep price tag. The countries that get first dibs on vaccines are the ones that can afford them.</p>
<p>Money can buy most things. But is it moral to have to buy protection against something like this? Some would argue that, in this case, poorer nations could be getting a death sentence.</p>
<p>Should the pharmaceutical corporations have to donate vaccines? Nothing requires them to be socially just or to give away their products for free. But if the product is a vaccine that could save millions of lives, well, things become more complicated. The issue of inherent human rights may begin to blend into the corporate priorities of profit and loss. Whose right is it to have protection from disease? The highest bidder? Maybe we should be asking why corporations control something that could seemingly save countless lives.</p>
<p>Several developed nations have pledged to donate their leftover H1N1 vaccines to developing nations. This sounds encouraging. But it fails to resolve the underlying issue of corporate versus human rights. Why are we a first priority for vaccines and developing nations only get some if we have leftovers? Are they less important? Do their residents have less value as human beings?</p>
<p>In the shadow of H1N1, we must not only wash our hands more, but we must to ask ourselves some tough questions. Maybe we should look again at how we define profit, charity, and human rights. I think everyone should be entitled to a vaccine against H1N1, regardless of their ability to pay for it. But who would pay for those vaccines? We should create some sort of - and this could just be the Canadian in me talking - international medicare. It could be funded by have states and administered by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>If the current situation deteriorates and H1N1 becomes a more serious problem, the outcome could swing two ways. In the one scenario, everyone who needs a vaccine would have access to one. On the other, the countries with money would purchase greater protection and have-not nations would face a potentially catastrophic health crisis. How can we prevent this? I'm not sure. But I believe human rights - in this case, the right to be protected against a deadly disease - should not be privately controlled.</p>
<p>Global crises raise situations we can't ignore and difficult questions. If this pandemic worsens, we must reconsider some of the systems our society is based upon. H1N1 is a disease that spans all borders, regardless of nationality and economic standpoint, and any real solution would undoubtedly need to do the same. At the very core of this issue, the question we need to ask is: Is one human life more valuable than another?</p>

<p>Re: "Coughing woman asked to get off transit bus," Oct. 10.</p>
<p>The hysteria surrounding the swine flu panic has reached fever pitch. One can't help but recall the SARS panic of several years ago.</p>
<p>While each death is regrettable, Canada had 43 deaths that were "probable" SARS cases, roughly the amount killed by cars every six days in Canada. (And we had the third highest incidence of SARS in the world!)</p>
<p>Why are we not inundated with countless news stories about the threat to our health posed by cars?</p>
<p>The so-called swine flu should be a non-issue. At this writing, swine flu is believed to have caused 4,525 deaths worldwide.</p>
<p>As regrettable as that is, keep in mind that 4,525 is the number of deaths caused by pharmaceutical drugs -- used as directed -- every eight days in the United States alone (based on figures from the Archives of Internal Medicine).</p>
<p>Why are we not inundated with countless news stories about the threat to our health posed by pharmaceutical drugs?</p>
<p>That people feel compelled to ask others to refrain from using public transit because of a cough is beyond ridiculous. It would seem that a concurrent illness has recently broken out, a pathological fear fuelled by the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and induced by media hype: I call it "Swine Flu over the Cuckoo's Nest."</p>

</p>
<p>As a former ER physician, Dr. Brian Schwartz is well suited to his multiple roles in helping manage the province's response to swine flu.</p>
<p>Known to keep a cool head when the going gets tough, Schwartz's skills are being put to the test: he serves as director of emergency management support for Ontario's public health agency, chair of a scientific advisory team on H1N1 and scientific adviser to the health ministry's emergency management unit.</p>
<p>"It's part of the makeup of an emergency doc," he says.</p>
<p>"I honestly feel that I do better, I'm more alert and more attuned in times of crisis than I am at normal times."</p>
<p>Schwartz is one of a number of doctors and health-care professionals who have been consumed by swine flu since April.</p>
<p>These flu fighters toil mostly behind the scenes, tracking the movement of the bug, ensuring there are sufficient supplies of antivirals, helping hospitals and other health-care institutions prepare for an influx of flu-stricken patients, guiding public health units in planning flu clinics and ultimately trying to ensure Ontarians are protected from this virus.</p>
<p>Schwartz has practised emergency medicine for more than 30 years. At 57, he retired this past July as emergency room doctor at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, which, as one of two major trauma centres in Toronto, sees a large number of complex emergency cases.</p>
<p>While at Sunnybrook, he also served as medical director of both land and flight paramedics.</p>
<p>And for almost a decade he has served as a consultant to Toronto Emergency Services in the development of its emergency response plans.</p>
<p>Now, Schwartz brings together the province's brightest minds in such fields as infection control, epidemiology and vaccine deployment.</p>
<p>They offer guidance on a wide array of issues, from ensuring hospitals have enough ventilators to ensuring the public is being super vigilant about handwashing.</p>
<p>There were a few weeks in late April and early May, when there was so much worldwide uncertainty about the H1N1 virus, that these flu fighters worked around the clock, with little or no time off.</p>
<p>"Certainly, at the outset when we had all the reports from Mexico, we basically worked straight for two weeks trying to get things going, thinking that this may be a severe pandemic," Schwartz says.</p>
<p>"There were some very frightening moments, reminiscent very much of SARS."</p>
<p>Schwartz had also been called upon to serve as vice-chair of the scientific advisory committee during the SARS outbreak in 2003.</p>
<p>So far this crisis is unfolding more smoothly, both professionally and personally, he observes.</p>
<p>During SARS, Ontario didn't even have a public health agency and responders were flying by the seats of their pants.</p>
<p>Soon after the scientific advisory committee was formed back then, about a third of the group was sent home on quarantine for 10 days. Schwartz was among them.</p>
<p>"This was not that public at the time, but one of the scientists came down with SARS and six of the members were deemed to have had enough exposure to her that we were sent home on quarantine," he says.</p>
<p>"We were scrambling back then because we had no pool of people to draw on," he adds.</p>
<p>Despite the hectic nature of his job, Schwartz attends Talmud class at his synagogue every day at 6: 15 a.m. and jogs regularly.</p>
<p>"I protect a couple of hours during the day for my physical and to some extent my intellectual and spiritual needs, and also for my family," he says.</p>
<p>Schwartz has been married for 30 years, has four children and six grandchildren.</p>
<p>When a journalist remarked on the balance in his life, he offered credit to his better half:</p>
<p>"My wife is a marriage and family therapist. She keeps me on the straight and narrow."</p>
<p>President, Ontario Agency of Health Protection and Promotion</p>
<p>Bedtime reading for Goel these days consists of catching up on emails; he gets about 500 a day.</p>
<p>As the head of Ontario's public health agency, he's the province's front man in the battle against swine flu.</p>
<p>The agency links the ministry of health, public health practitioners, front-line health workers and researchers to the best scientific intelligence around the world.</p>
<p>Goel's long days consist of back-to-back meetings and teleconferences with health-care professionals, scientists, academics and policy-makers.</p>
<p>"We live in a world of teleconference hell," he jokes.</p>
<p>The public health agency opened its doors just over a year ago, a post-SARS creation intended to enable the province to respond more nimbly to health-care emergencies.</p>
<p>"We had hoped we would have had a couple of years to build up and prepare before something like this came upon us," Goel says.</p>
<p>With a constant barrage of new information on H1N1 coming from scientific journals and the media, Goel and his team try to separate the wheat from the chaff and alter the province's response accordingly.</p>
<p>India-born Goel, 48, has impressive credentials. Prior to joining the agency last year, he was vice-president and provost at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>He studied medicine at the University of Toronto and Montreal's McGill.</p>
<p>He has a Master's degree in health administration from U of T and a Master's in biostatistics from Harvard.</p>
<p>Director of Surveillance and Epidemiology, Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion</p>
<p>Dr. Natasha Crowcroft is Ontario's lead swine flu detective.</p>
<p>She and her team of epidemiologists and public-health doctors track the movement of the bug, analyzing data from labs, public-health units and physicians to detect trends, for example, who is being infected and where. They are the ones who detected a recent increase in H1N1 activity, signalling that the second wave of the virus has hit Ontario.</p>
<p>"It has been incredibly busy. The hardest thing is everyone wants to know what's going on," she says. Her team is running a major study to determine how many people in Ontario have been infected with H1N1, using lab test results from 3,000 volunteers who donated blood samples during the summer.</p>
<p>They are also projecting the impact of the bug based on modelling of its spread in the southern hemisphere. The graphs and charts her team produces help the province formulate its response to changes in virus activity.</p>
<p>The England-born Crowcroft, 47, says H1N1 has taken over her life: "Everybody wants you to be in meetings and teleconferences and commenting on papers. There aren't enough hours in the day to do everything, so it requires a certain amount of priority setting."</p>
<p>Chief Medical Officer of Health for Ontario</p>
<p>It was sheer coincidence that Ontario appointed its new chief medical officer of health on April 23, the same day news of a strange respiratory illness began to come out of Mexico.</p>
<p>And it was a stroke of luck that the new chief just happened to be an international expert in immunization, infectious diseases and pandemic planning.</p>
<p>"It was a really unusual alignment of events that occurred on that day," reflects Dr. Arlene King, who was recruited from Ottawa, where she worked as director general of the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases at the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>It has been a trial by fire for King, who started her job June 15, shortly before the H1N1 outbreak was declared a global pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's been an interesting three months," says King, 53. "It's been consumed by managing the response."</p>
<p>She was born in Toronto and lived her first 25 years in and around the GTA before attending medical school at McMaster University in Hamilton. She went on to become a specialist in family medicine and obtained a Master's degree in health sciences.</p>
<p>King sits on two World Health Organization committees on pandemic preparedness. She has lived all over the country and is happy to return to Toronto, which she says "very much feels like home."</p>
<p>While she has many relatives in the GTA, the closest they get to seeing her these days is on television newscasts.</p>
<p>Her days are usually 12 hours long, "not including BlackBerry time."</p>
<p>Director of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Ontario Agency for Public Health Protection and Promotion</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam, 45, has turned into a sort of play-by-play commentator on swine flu activity in Ontario. Though it's not really his job at Ontario's public health agency, he's the guy the media turns to cut through the scientific jargon and address conflicting information on issues such as vaccines and handwashing</p>
<p>"The role I stumbled into is explaining what's going on," Gardam says. "There's a lot of confusion out there."</p>
<p>His official role at the agency is to help ensure the province is prepared to deal with infectious diseases and communicable diseases.</p>
<p>He had played a major role in the development of the province's pandemic plan, a 600-plus page report that spells out, for example, the roles and responsibilities of health-care officials and institutions.</p>
<p>While his work at the agency consumes about 60 hours a week, it's only one of his three jobs.</p>
<p>He's also director of infection control at University Health Network and runs a tuberculosis clinic at Toronto Western Hospital.</p>
<p>A good humoured man, Gardam jokes that he's a "flu geek." He has a bowl of stuffed creatures on his desk - two flu viruses and three Rhinoviruses.</p>
<p>He has even bought some as presents for his two daughters and staff.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Diabetes emerges as insidious killer in Canada</b>
</div><div>Margaret Munro </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1505 words</div><div>12 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Rodney Mckenzie was alone in a cabin in northern Saskatchewan when he woke up and realized something was seriously wrong.</p>
<p>"Everything was foggy," says Mckenzie, recalling the day he began losing his sight five years ago. Luckily it hadn't snowed and he managed to snowmobile home, sticking to the road he'd come up on.</p>
<p>Next, his kidneys failed and another journey began, this one from his home in Stanley Mission south to Saskatoon. He's made the 870-kilometre round trip three times a week for the last two years to receive the dialysis treatment that is keeping him alive.</p>
<p>This summer, another loss, as sores festered on Mckenzie's right foot. Powerful antibiotics couldn't clear the infection. Fearing gangrene would kill him, doctors amputated the lower half of his right leg. "It's been kind of hard adjusting to this," says Mckenzie, 37, his smile cracking as he gestures toward his missing foot.</p>
<p>The grim toll is all thanks to a single insidious disease: diabetes.</p>
<p>As illnesses go it is a quiet one, provoking little of the fear inspired by the H1N1 flu dominating the headlines.</p>
<p>But diabetes is epidemic and poised to get much worse. More than two million Canadians have the disease and it is estimated another five million -- 15 per cent of the country's population -- are "pre-diabetic" and an increasing, and worrying, number of them are young adults, and children.</p>
<p>By the end of September, 78 Canadians with H1N1, or swine flu, had died.</p>
<p>Diabetes is linked to close to 40,000 deaths a year in Canada and thousands more people are maimed by the disease, which is overwhelming the meagre medical services in many remote communities. Unchecked, doctors fear the disease will swamp the health-care system.</p>
<p>This story is part of a Canwest News Service series that has been funded in part by a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p>
<p>"I don't think we are remotely prepared," says Dr. Karen Yeates, a kidney specialist at Queen's University in Kingston, who has a growing caseload of diabetics on dialysis treatment, which rings in at $50,000 to $60,000 a year per person.</p>
<p>Detailed Canadian figures are hard to come by, but the financial implications of the epidemic are "enormous," an expert panel reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada earlier this year. It estimated diabetes' medical and economic impact is already costing Canada $17 billion a year.</p>
<p>And the costs are sure to rise, says Dr. Stewart Harris, a leading diabetes researcher at London's University of Western Ontario, as "the tsunami of complications has yet to hit." Serious complications, like the ones that have Mckenzie trekking to Saskatoon three times a week, tend to occur 10 to 20 years after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Despite growing alarm and dismay in health circles, diabetes gets scant attention compared to diseases like AIDS or flu even though it takes a much higher toll.</p>
<p>"I just wish they'd issue weekly reports on diabetes like they do for the swine flu -- how many amputations, how many people going blind, how many kidney failures, how many people dying," says Darlene Arnault, nurse manager at Stanley Mission, where diabetes rates have soared. "What bothers me most is the acceptance of the disease, as if it's normal."</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that there is no microbe to blame for diabetes and no magic pill to cure it.</p>
<p>The disease, which mucks with sugar uptake in the blood, is a slow and insidious killer. It hits the poor and marginalized more often than the affluent and educated. And it tends to sneak up on people as it numbs nerves in the feet, damages retinal cells in the eyes, clogs up the cardiovascular system, cuts circulation and destroys tiny filters in the kidneys.</p>
<p>Mckenzie didn't believe he was even sick. "I was in denial for a long time," says the former millwright, as he lies in a Saskatoon hospital bed, blood running from a tube in his wrist to a dialysis machine now doing the job of his kidneys.</p>
<p>Sedentary lifestyles and the modern banquet of food laced with sugar and fat are said to be fuelling the explosion of Type 2 diabetes, which is now the most common form of the disease, affecting nine out of 10 Canadian diabetics.</p>
<p>Genetics also plays a role, with people of Asian, Latin American and African ancestry at increased risk. Aboriginal people are even more susceptible, with rates up to five times the Canadian average.</p>
<p>"It's a slow-motion emergency, with aboriginal communities leading the way," says Dr. Jay Wortman, a Metis doctor with Health Canada, which is charting an epidemic that is escalating as Canadians grow older and more obese. The number of Canadians diagnosed as diabetic almost doubled, to close to 2.3 million, in the past decade, and another 200,000 people learn they have the disease each year.</p>
<p>Public health officials and medical specialists like to say Type 2 diabetes is preventable. Their solution sounds simple enough: eat and exercise in moderation. Just 30 minutes of brisk walking a day and losing five to seven per cent of body weight can cut the risk by more than 50 per cent.</p>
<p>Easy to say, much harder to do, judging by the soaring obesity and disease rates.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is human nature. People did not evolve in a world where food was served up, often in excess, several times a day, says diabetes specialist Dr. Hertzel Gerstein, at McMaster University in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Doctors also note diabetes can be managed and the worst complications kept at bay if diabetics adopt healthy diets and lifestyles, routinely monitor their blood sugar and take medications as prescribed.</p>
<p>But "self-advocacy" is also critical, and not something that can be prescribed in a bottle.</p>
<p>Mckenzie was 18 when he was diagnosed. He and some friends were fooling around with blood-sugar monitors in a science class and he kept getting high readings. The school nurse sent him off to the local clinic. He was released two weeks later with instructions to check his blood sugar "four times a day, seven days a week." He was also told to avoid pop, eat wholesome food and give up cigarettes.</p>
<p>Nurse Arnault, in Stanley Mission, used to badger Mckenzie to take better care of himself.</p>
<p>"He thought he was invincible," she recalls.</p>
<p>Mckenzie now lives in Stanley Mission with his father, who is helping him cope with the loss of his sight, his kidneys and his leg.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>How Diabetes Ravages the Human Body</p>
<p>Diabetes interferes with the way the body processes the sugar glucose, the body's main source of energy. When all is going well, cells absorb glucose from the blood stream after we've eaten and use it as fuel, or pack it away for future use. Insulin, produced by the pancreas, orchestrates the process. With diabetes, the process breaks down, and glucose start to builds up in the blood.</p>
<p>There are three types of diabetes:</p>
<p>- Type 1, usually diagnosed in children and adolescents, is caused when the body can't produce insulin. The body's immune system or environmental factors are believed to trigger Type 1, which accounts for 10 per cent of diabetes.</p>
<p>- Type 2, which accounts for 90 per cent of diabetes, usually begins when the glucose-absorbing cells lose their ability to mop up sugar and it starts to build up in the blood. Overeating, sedentary lifestyles and an aging population are believed to be fuelling the explosion of Type 2, which affects 250 million people worldwide, up from 30 million in 1985.</p>
<p>- Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and increases the risk to both the mother and child of developing Type 2.</p>
<p>- "Pre-diabetes" means the body's cells are not responding properly to insulin, and sugar levels in the blood begin to rise. Left unchecked, more than half of people with pre-diabetes develop full-blown diabetes within eight to 10 years.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>65 and older? Flu shots start Tuesday</b>
</div><div>Denise Balkissoon   </div>

</p>
<p>Standard flu shots are being made available to people 65 and older, as well as those in long-term care facilities, in some Toronto-area municipalities starting Tuesday.</p>
<p>"There's a concern this year about the complexity of the message," Dr. Bob Nosal, medical officer of health for Halton Region, said of Ontario's unprecedented approach to flu shots this season.</p>
<p>In past years, a provincial vaccination program for the flu began in early October. This year, with both seasonal flu and the H1N1 virus on the horizon, the province's vaccination strategy has three stages.</p>
<p>First are seasonal vaccines for high-risk groups. Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, says people 65 and older and those in long-term care facilities are less likely to catch the H1N1 virus, and more susceptible to complications from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Unpublished research suggests seasonal flu inoculations might make people more susceptible to swine flu, so the next round of shots will be for H1N1, with clinics opening early in November.</p>
<p>Seasonal flu shots for the general population won't begin until December or January.</p>
<p>For details on Halton Region's seasonal clinics for the high-risk groups, see www.halton.ca/health[http://www.halton.ca/health].</p>
<p>From Tuesday to Oct. 30, Peel will hold clinics for the same groups. Details at www.peelregion.ca[http://www.peelregion.ca].</p>
<p>Family physicians in Durham Region have seasonal flu vaccines for those 65 and older.</p>
<p>Seasonal vaccines will be available to the at-risk group in Toronto beginning Oct. 22; the city says a list of locations will be available on www.toronto.ca[http://www.toronto.ca] as of Friday.</p>
<p>York Region will run a seasonal flu clinic for those 65 and older in the last two weeks of October. See www.york.ca/H1N1[http://www.york.ca/H1N1] for details.</p>
<p>The province isn't sure whether it will make vaccines available to employers who want to set up workplace clinics, as it has in the past.</p>
<p>Health ministry spokesman David Jensen said the province had hoped to provide vaccinations to employers who want to set up workplace clinics - but this year's two shots have made that complicated.</p>

</p>
<p>c ynicism would seem to be an appropriate response to Thanksgiving after the kind of year the world has endured. What good are platitudes when your livelihood and health are threatened by forces beyond your control --the recession and the H1N1 flu? Gratitude might appear as unfashionable as suspenders, but this is not so. All signs indicate that the big picture is steadily improving and, as for the small things, theyhaveneverstopped flooding us with blessings. Not all is right with the world, but it is getting better.</p>
<p>The desolate economic landscape is beginning to bloom again. Growth is returning and the financial system has jerked haltingly out of its year-long coma, buoyed by rising consumer confidence. Economic output is no longer declining, stock markets are on the rise and the world's gross domestic product is expected to grow by a decent margin next year. Most encouragingly, world leaders of every stripe have put aside their ideologies and are working in concert to ensure that growth and prosperity are sustained by a full recovery. Although the financial meltdown is considered the worst crisis since the Great Depression, it has lasted a fraction as long while the wrenching social dislocation, starvation and collapse seen in the 1930s have been averted.</p>
<p>There is no lack of triumphs to celebrate on the home front, either. One of the values dearest to Canadian hearts, and one for which we should be thankful each day, is free speech, a commodity we possess now in greater abundance.</p>
<p>Last month, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal issued an unprecedented ruling that Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which relates to hate speech, contravenes the right to free expression because it has been made to serve anopenlypunitiverather than a conciliatory purpose. While not binding, this is a victory for all Canadians, not just Marc Lemire, the controversial webmaster who challenged the law. Canadians can say what they like without being muzzled, a liberty denied most of humanity. Canadian democracy will emerge stronger, fairer and more just--something else to be thankful for.</p>
<p>Readers unconvinced by a rosy big picture should refocus on the little things. A staggering quantity of those things must--and unfailingly do--function correctly every second of each day to guarantee Canadians the stable and comfortable lives to which we are accustomed in a free and well-governed country.</p>
<p>In short, just by living here, we are among the luckiest people on the planet.</p>
<p>Give some thought to the little things and the big things when you sit down for Thanksgiving dinner and favourite fixings with your family. It is opportunities for despair, rather than gratitude, that Canadians truly lack.</p>

<p>How many ways can you kill a pumpkin? The Edmonton Journal decided to investigate--in the name of a worry-free Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>These are frustrating, distressing times. The economy is sluggish. Unemployment is rife. Pensions are in jeopardy. There's the H1N1 virus to fret about, not to mention health-care cutbacks.</p>
<p>And don't forget about homelessness, and poverty, and elder abuse, and crystal meth addiction, and climate change, and racism, and bad driving, and bullying, and pyromaniacal neighbours who insist on building bonfire after bonfire after bonf--. It's enough to spoil your turkey dinner.</p>
<p>We didn't want your holiday clouded by worry about the state of the world. So we asked our readers to tell us, via web poll and e-mail, what worries they'd like us to destroy. Then we wrote those worries on squash--and squashed them. In a variety of theatrical, entertaining ways.</p>
<p>It was pretty darn therapeutic. Take a look on our website today.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Waiting in line for health's sake; Ottawa begins vaccinating seniors against seasonal flu ahead of H1N1 shots</b>
</div><div>Dave Rogers </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>826 words</div><div>11 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>(From The Ottawa Citizen, October 21, 2009) The next seasonal flu vaccine clinic for people 65 and older will be held on Saturday, Oct. 24 at The Good Companions Seniors' Centre, 670 Albert St., from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. An article on page A3 Oct. 11 may have left some readers with the impression that the clinic was to be held on Oct. 17.*****</p>
<p>Ottawa residents 65 and older began lining up for the city's first seasonal-flu vaccine clinic at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, an hour before it was scheduled to open.</p>
<p>Three hours later, one corridor of Holy Trinity High School at 180 Katimavik Rd. in Kanata was packed with dozens of seniors waiting patiently for nurses to give them their flu shots.</p>
<p>By the time the clinic ended at 3:30 p.m., 942 people had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Most knew they would need a second H1N1 vaccination later, but did not seem overly concerned about two needles. A few were concerned that they would head south before the second vaccine becomes available, but said they would probably pay for another flu shot in Florida.</p>
<p>The plan in Ontario is to vaccinate over-65s against seasonal flu, then roll out vaccinations against H1N1 swine flu, and then offer seasonal-flu vaccines to younger Ontarians, possibly in November. This approach is meant to deliver the vaccines to the people who need them most, when they'll do the most good.</p>
<p>Jack Fawcett, 76, who is leaving Ottawa for a trip south at the end of October, said he will probably get the H1N1 vaccine in Florida. His wife, Deryle Fawcett, said the couple paid $30 each for a flu vaccine in Arizona two years ago. "We wish we could have the other vaccine now but we were told it would be available in about three weeks," Deryle Fawcett said. "I doubt we will be able to get the second vaccine before we leave."</p>
<p>Walter Hayduk, 78, said it is a nuisance to wait in line twice for more than an hour to get two flu shots. "It is a long process -- I didn't expect it, I have to say. The wait wasn't quite as long last year. Maybe next time I will bring a book or a newspaper."</p>
<p>Dale MacGregor, 68, said he is not sure whether he will need a second vaccination because he thinks people over 65 will have some immunity to the H1N1 virus. He said he was more concerned about being vaccinated against seasonal flu and will ask his doctor whether he needs a second shot.</p>
<p>Rory Hayter, 69, who was in a wheelchair, said he got into the clinic in about 30 minutes because he is disabled. A regular at the Kanata clinic, Hayter said the lineup seemed longer than usual this year. "I am a little worried about two vaccinations," Hayter said. "You hear lots of stories about people being more susceptible to H1N1 if they have had the regular flu shot.</p>
<p>"But it is better to take this flu shot now and come back later for the next one. I will probably come back for the H1N1 vaccine if other people don't have adverse reactions."</p>
<p>The next clinic will be held at Sacred Heart High School, located at 5870 Abbott Rd. in Stittsville, on Wednesday from 2:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Another will be held at The Good Companions Seniors' Centre at 670 Albert St. on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. For the full list of clinics, visit the City of Ottawa website at ottawa.ca.</p>
<p>The federal government has not pinpointed a date to roll out the H1N1 vaccine in October, contrary to what a media report said earlier this week. The report said the government was planning to begin shipping the vaccine to provinces and territories Oct. 19 to be ready for distribution Oct. 26. But a spokesman for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said the government is still aiming to have the vaccine ready in the first week of November.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer said Wednesday that 35 per cent or more of the country could become sick with H1N1.</p>

<p>Re: "Flu rewrites social rituals," Oct. 7.</p>
<p>Your article on the need to modify our social interactions in light of the H1N1 flu reported the Calgary Minor Soccer Association's new guideline. This is that teams should face each other and clap or cheer, instead of shaking hands individually after a game, which is one sensible solution to the problem of virus transmission. It does, however, lose the one-on-one acknowledgment and perhaps even dignity of a sort provided by the individual greeting. There is no "I" in team, but each team is made of individuals and it helps our ability to avoid labelling or lumping groups together when we are reminded of that by acknowledging each member of the other team separately. May I suggest that we borrow from Eastern cultures and replace the handshake with a small bow?A bow is a sign of respect and acknowledgment. It works in the martial arts. Let us put it to use in other sports too.</p>

<p>Worried about H1N1 influenza and looking for an alternative to the traditional greeting kiss this Thanksgiving weekend?</p>
<p>Consider the fist bump or an Eastern-style namaste, says an etiquette expert.</p>
<p>Julie Blais Comeau says hosts who want to have a "no handshake and kiss" greeting for their Thanksgiving dinner should welcome guests with eye contact, a smile and a greeting -- or even a simple hug without kissing.</p>
<p>Other options for greeting company:</p>
<p>- The mini head bow: It's been Donald's Trump preferred method of greeting for a long time.</p>
<p>- A hand wave: Picture the Queen's jaunty wave.</p>
<p>- The fist bump: The mayor of Memphis, Tenn., greeted the Dalai Lama this way because one of his staff had recently been diagnosed with H1N1.</p>
<p>- Elbow to elbow: The ladies of ABC's The View demonstrated this.</p>
<p>- Namaste: The yoga greeting with hands in front of the chest.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, B.C.'s. chief medical health officer, said washing your hands frequently and staying home if you're feeling ill are probably more important than avoiding a greeting hug or a kiss.</p>
<p>"It might be prudent not to shake hands or kiss," said Kendall.</p>
<p>"[But] if you are in an intimate family gathering, you are going to be so close that you probably have more to worry about airborne transmission droplets from somebody coughing or laughing than you would from hand-to-hand contact."</p>
<p>Blais Comeau, an etiquette expert based in Ottawa, says hosts should take extra sanitary precautions throughout their homes, including using drink identifiers such as wine charms, coloured swizzle sticks or straws, or using permanent markers to write names on beer cans or bottles. She suggests providing ladles or prongs to serve munchies, veggies, fruits, appetizers and bread rolls.</p>
<p>In washrooms, offer tissue, soap in pump bottles and hand sanitizers, says Blais Comeau. Use individually rolled hand towels instead of a common towel.</p>
<p>As for the greeting kiss and hug, cultural historian Patricia Kidd, a PhD student at the University of Victoria, said it's unlikely to go away for good.</p>
<p>"We are in essence animals, and we will always go back because we need that touch," said Kidd. "Our need to touch is more important than any temporary need to avoid germs."</p>

<p>Vancouver police seize 'silent killing machine' fished out of Fraser River.</p>
<p>Backchat</p>
<p>Anonymous says:</p>
<p>RCMP looking for owner? Have they started looking in the U.S., perhaps? That's probably where the gun was stolen in the first place.</p>
<p>B says:</p>
<p>The firearm is also of a prohibited type. Criminals register their prohibited firearms, right?</p>
<p>ADY says:</p>
<p>Can the gun manufacturer be traced? Maybe the gun manufacturers should have speciality liability insurance just in case their weapons fall into the wrong hands. Could they be bonded for such insurance liability? Parental and corporation accountability: If we can put parents on trial for failure to provide equal protection and security to a minor, why not the parent companies fined for their weapons falling into the wrong hands?</p>
<p>Trial and Error says:</p>
<p>Seized the gun? Sounds impressive. Too bad a fisherman found it and simply gave it to them.</p>
<p>Peter says:</p>
<p>I found it humorous that the headline for this article says "police seize silent killing machine" when the story itself clearly says that the weapon was turned over to police by the fisherman who found it. Unless they roughed him up when he walked into the station with it and "seized" it from him.</p>
<p>Tom says:</p>
<p>It is not called a silencer, it is called a suppressor. It is designed to "suppress" the hot gases as the rounds travel down the barrel and out the front. It muffles the sound, but hardly "silences" it. Hollywood uses the term "silencer" when in fact it should be called a suppressor.</p>
<p>Random says:</p>
<p>Oh lord. This is going to add some drama. I once had someone throw a gun into my lap and told me to "check it out!" Sorry, buds, I'm not stupid enough to put my prints on it. Now this poor kid will have to "rat" someone out, and then get killed. Silly if they think someone would shoot up an entire city and then leave prints behind by accident.</p>
<p>CHACHI says:</p>
<p>Sounds like inexperienced and incompetent gang wannabes. I hope DNA and prints show up on the weapon.</p>
<p>Chopper says:</p>
<p>"Make no mistake -- this is a silent killing machine capable of firing 1,200 rounds per minute." Wow 1,200 rounds from a 30-round mag. It's called rate of fire. This means a 30-round mag can be discharged in approximately 1.5 seconds.</p>
<p>John Wilson says:</p>
<p>I'm so glad we have the billion-dollar gun registry. I can sleep so much sounder at night.</p>
<p>Item</p>
<p>Truckers furious after driver fined for smoking in cab.</p>
<p>Backchat</p>
<p>Jerry says:</p>
<p>Please tell me there is more to this. Like he was pulled over for something else and lipped off to the cop and talked himself into the ticket.</p>
<p>dm says:</p>
<p>Well the law does state that smoking is banned in an enclosed workplace. A truck like that is a workplace.</p>
<p>cms says:</p>
<p>Since when is a truck considered an enclosed workplace? Trucks do have windows, so if a window is open, it's not enclosed. Did this cop see him smoking with the windows closed?</p>
<p>Such whiners says:</p>
<p>Quit whining and giving all of these excuses for the fact that you just don't want to quit smoking. While we're all getting second-hand smoke, and we don't complain like you whiners of today. Only idiots smoke anyway. And for you truckers, I think you should worry more about how badly most of you drive and are very rude on the road instead of complaining about being able to smoke.</p>
<p>Tom says:</p>
<p>If they were hauling a highly combustible load I could see it; otherwise leave them alone.</p>
<p>Item</p>
<p>Vancouver school officials concerned hand sanitizer would be used as fire starter, or students would drink or ignite it.</p>
<p>Backchat</p>
<p>Gary says:</p>
<p>I hear they are removing all books and paper from schools as they</p>
<p>just found out the flammability of pulp products. At least they aren't putting a body bag dispenser in the schools. This swine hype is getting on my nerves. I wish I'd bought</p>
<p>stock in Purell.</p>
<p>Surrey is not concerned says:</p>
<p>You would think in Surrey they would ban the fire-starting hand sanitizer. My guess is that's where the next spring of fires will start. Vancouver takes caution in its decision and Surrey just waits for it to be a problem.</p>
<p>Doc says:</p>
<p>Just wash your hands with soap and water. There is no need for these "sanitizers."</p>
<p>Mike says:</p>
<p>We have a problem with fires in our schools? it's ridiculous, We are becoming America Jr. The Province should be ashamed.</p>
<p>fedup says:</p>
<p>Hey, I would never have made the connection between Purell and flammability. Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>Valley Hillbilly says:</p>
<p>Good move by the VSB. Hand sanitizers are not a substitute for hand washing with soap and warm water. More convenient perhaps, but very dangerous to small children; and even more dangerous to older children with a view to getting a high, or creating mischief. <span class="companylink">Google</span> hand-sanitizer dangers, and you'll find a wealth of them in this poison. Regular use will result in dry, brittle and cracked skin, due to the high alcohol content. Kids who bite their nails are ingesting alcohol that has been absorbed by the nails. I could go on, but do your own research. Hand sanitizers have a place in hospitals and doctors' offices, but that's about it. Plain old soap, and not the antibacterial kind, is the best prevention of flu.</p>
<p>cejaay says:</p>
<p>Gee, thanks. I didn't know you could use this as a fire-starter. Info may come in handy. What's in tomorrow's paper? A recipe for mustard gas?</p>
<p>Danno says:</p>
<p>It's not a big deal. There's a lot of flammable things that are easy for kids to get their hands on. Probably best not to advertise more options, though.</p>

<p>The Vancouver School Board has decided against installing hand sanitizers in schools as part of a larger effort to stem the spread of seasonal flu, including H1N1.</p>
<p>We applaud this decision . . . with hands that we have properly washed.</p>
<p>Firstly, makers of this product often warn buyers on the bottle to "keep away from children." They do this for a reason. Hand-sanitizing gels can be up to 60 per cent alcohol, and, as a result, can be misused to produce adverse results.</p>
<p>For example, the product can be consumed to produce a dangerous high; it can also be set on fire, as more than one <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video attests.</p>
<p>Moreover, hand sanitizers are of minimal effectiveness if the person using the product does not maintain proper hygiene.</p>
<p>In other words, dirty, germ-ridden mitts are not miraculously clean of all viruses the moment a little sanitizing gel is applied.</p>
<p>The school board is correct to state that the best method of preventing the spread of a flu virus is to stress to all students the crucial importance of proper hand-washing.</p>

</p>
<p>A Victoria woman who was asked to get off a bus because she was coughing says concerns about H1N1 have reached hysteria levels.</p>
<p>"I get the concern," said Jenn Chapman, 41, a human resources worker. "There needs to be some precaution, there needs to be some education. But there needs to be way less hype."</p>
<p>Chapman said on Thursday she was riding a bus and coughing into her sleeve, as directed by public health officials -- even though her doctor has assured her she doesn't have H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>An elderly woman sitting some distance away told Chapman she shouldn't be riding public transit with a cough. The woman then approached the driver and demanded he take action.</p>
<p>The driver, although clearly uncomfortable, asked Chapman if she was close enough to her destination to leave the bus. Since she was only two stops away, she got off to keep the peace.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do? I was brought up to respect my elders," said Chapman. "She wasn't rational at that point."</p>
<p>Medical officials have said those born before 1957 are the least likely to contract H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>B.C. Transit spokeswoman Joanna Morton said drivers have discretion in maintaining "a safe and secure" transit environment." But Morton expressed gratitude to Chapman for being accommodating by getting off.</p>
<p>As for H1N1, she said B.C. Transit is working on a strategy in consultation with health officials to reduce public risk, adding buses are now disinfected every night.</p>
<p>Victoria Coun. Philippe Lucas believes B.C. Transit should also consider installing hand sanitizers on transit buses. "In such a crowded, high-use public area, it seems common sense that we would have them," Lucas said.</p>
<p>"People are hanging on to the poles on a bus and the benches in the bus in a way that we don't normally at a convenience store or a grocery store."</p>
<p>Lucas said B.C. Transit should also consider making pamphlets available outlining correct coughing protocol, safe hand-washing techniques and other protective measures.</p>
<p>Lucas recently won support for the idea from the city's environment and infrastructure committee, which is recommending Mayor Dean Fortin write B.C. Transit suggesting the change.</p>
<p>Morton said any decision about installing hand sanitizers would be up to the transit commission, adding that with about 250 buses in the fleet, it wouldn't be a small job.</p>
<p>In Chapman's case, Dr. Richard Stanwick, chief medical health officer for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said the complaining passenger needn't have worried as long as Chapman was coughing in her sleeve.</p>
<p>He said health officials hope coughing or sneezing without a tissue or hankie -- or into the crook of the arm -- eventually goes as out of favour as public spitting.</p>
<p>"What we really want to do is see a fairly significant social change in how people handle their secretions."</p>

</div><div>By Barbara Bowes / Working World </div>

<p>11For instance, there have been reports of churches removing holy water and instead providing worshippers with hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Retailers and many other businesses are also providing hand sanitizers at every counter while facility managers have placed special hand sanitizer modules in front of their elevators.</p>
<p>Every sector of our life is responding to the danger. Individuals, fearful of touching the elevator buttons, are instead using the sleeve of their jacket or poking the buttons with their car keys. At the same time, they are rushing to retail outlets and causing a frantic run on supplies such as surgical masks and cold medicines.</p>
<p>Children and youth involved in sports, on the other hand, are being asked to give up the traditional fist bump and the handshake for a simple friendly wave to each other. If this keeps up, we might even see the re-emergence of that old 1960s peace sign!</p>
<p>While all these activities just mentioned are occurring outside of an organization, believe me, there will be equally challenging internal issues facing organizations when the so-called pandemic hits. These human resource challenges will be difficult to manage and will require significant planning.</p>
<p>As can be expected, many employers and employees alike will suffer from a lack of information and will act out of fear. To be sure, there will be some genuinely traumatic situations, but you will also find a very small number of people who will actually try to take advantage of the situation. After all, a crisis brings out both the best and the worst in organizations and people.</p>
<p>As a result, you can expect to see conflicts such as those between employee and employee, employee and employer, and employee and customer issues. For instance, one more fearful employee may become quite fastidious in their drive to remain germ free. This may irritate colleagues who in turn will become annoyed or angry. This then leads to interpersonal conflict, blame and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The situation might also escalate into a complaint to management and a request to physically move work locations or stay home and be removed and from the workplace even when there is no real need to do so. The employer, now faced with a disgruntled employee on one side and an angry employee on the other, has a challenging problem to solve.</p>
<p>From the customer perspective, we have already seen the situation where a restaurant declined service to an individual who had experienced H1N1. As you can imagine, the number of potential issues is huge and the impact on both employee relations and customer relations will be significant.</p>
<p>Yet we know that most small and medium-sized businesses, particularly those without an HR professional, are not in any way prepared for the H1N1 pandemic. Mike Cuma, an HR specialist in employee relations and a vice-president at Legacy Bowes Group, suggests that, "In some ways the H1N1 pandemic is hitting at the worst possible time -- the fourth quarter/year end for many businesses. Challenging economic times have already caused many businesses to reduce their workforces and now they face a very busy time with reduced staff resources. Combine this issue with a busy Christmas season and unpredictable absences due to illness, these businesses may have a very difficult situation on their hands."</p>
<p>Cuma, recently selected as the national H1N1 trainer on HR issues for the Infectious Disease Control Agency, suggests that the lack of planning by medium and small business is a serious issue, particularly because these businesses and organizations don't have the personnel capacity that will give them the flexibility needed in the event up to 30 per cent of their workforce is off sick.</p>
<p>In addition, Cuma warns that those organizations already suffering from poor people management, poor communication and ineffective employee involvement can expect to experience even more extreme stress and worsened employee relations. As well, their lack of planning sends a strong and negative message to employees. The result will surely be an increase in unnecessary absenteeism and a spike in workers compensation and insurance claims as employees attempt to deal with the uncertainty on their own terms and avoid an unhealthy environment.</p>
<p>Cuma goes on to say it is every employer's responsibility to provide a healthy, safe workplace for their employees and he strongly urges small and medium-sized businesses to get started now. So, where does one start?</p>
<p>In Cuma's view, the first thing an employer must do is examine the nature of their business, the work performed and the level of risk confronted by employees. Are there workers who are on the front line dealing with customers or in high-risk occupations such as health care? Does the workforce include pregnant women, individuals with respiratory or other significant health concerns such as cardiac conditions or diabetes or are there employees over age 65? Plans must be put into place to protect these people as they are much more vulnerable than others.</p>
<p>According to Cuma, the next step is to determine how your business would be affected by high levels of absenteeism such as 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent of the workforce. As well, it is important to examine how changes in demand for products and services and potential interruptions to the supply chain will affect the organization. Cuma advises to think of the term ADS, which means absenteeism, demand and supply. On the other hand, in some cases, demand for products or services may actually increase. And in this case, how would a business operate if major suppliers were not capable of delivering materials or supplies as required?</p>
<p>Cuma also strongly recommends involving employees in the issues that will need to be faced. Where they exist, consult with and involve the workplace safety and health committee. If the workforce is represented by a union, review the specific provisions of the collective agreement and involve the appropriate individuals. Often joint labour-management or similar committees are in place and can be helpful.</p>
<p>Communication of the H1N1 plan is also essential. Utilize as many communication channels as possible, including all employee meetings, focus groups, crew or team meetings, information bulletins, intranet sites, safety messages, pay slip messages, newsletters and bulletin boards to name but a few. Last but not least, plan to test your plan: Consider a simulation scenario that will test not only what works, but more importantly what does not work.</p>
<p>Finally, Cuma says it is critical that employers understand their obligations under various legislation and regulations such as Workplace Health and Safety, Workers Compensation and Human Rights. Organizations must have clear processes in place and managers must conduct themselves appropriately so that potentially difficult or emotional situations are not exacerbated.</p>
<p>Some say the dreaded flu virus is not just on its way, it's here. And, while many individuals are busy stocking up on supplies, there are many small and medium-sized organizations that are not moving quickly enough to deal with this challenge. Call a human resource specialist to assist you to put a customized pandemic plan in place for your organization. Placing hand sanitizer on a nearby counter is simply not enough.</p>

</p>
<p>As the city gears up for a pandemic flu this winter, Toronto's medical officer of health is urging the Ontario government to look at making flu shots mandatory for all health care workers if the rates of immunization don't improve over the next three years.</p>
<p>The controversial recommendation is contained in a report from Dr. David McKeown, which is to be addressed at a board of health meeting on Oct. 19.</p>
<p>"Many of the institutions and most of the acute care hospitals have rates that are far too low, so I think we should make every effort to improve immunization rates among health care workers," McKeown said Friday night.</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty said last month the province will not force health workers or anyone else to be vaccinated against swine flu.</p>
<p>Linda Haslam-Stroud, president of the Ontario Nurses' Association, said getting the shot should be a personal decision: "We do not believe health-care workers, including nurses, should be arbitrarily mandated to take an influenza vaccine."</p>
<p>According to McKeown's report, the median coverage rate for immunization among health-care workers in Toronto was 42 per cent for those working in acute-care facilities such as hospitals, 55 per cent for continuing care-facilities and 70 per cent for long-term-care homes. The province's recommended rate is 70 per cent.</p>

<div>TORONTO STAR</div>
<div>1144 words</div><div>10 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>T12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>Qu I am standing on the boardwalk outside the Chateau Frontenac Hotel. The views are great. But more importantly my mother won't let me have an ice cream cone.</p>
<p>"You'll get a tummy ache!" she shrieks.</p>
<p>I'm 46 years old.</p>
<p>Every year I travel with my mom on our annual buddy bonding trip. But it's always by her rules. This time I'm putting my foot down. I buy a softee cone from a scruffy guy at the stand. After 15 minutes of slurping away I promptly get a knot in my stomach.</p>
<p>Why is my mom always right?</p>
<p>Worried about terrorism, swine flu and potential cross-border passport strip searches, my 79-year-old mother decided this year we would tour Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa. Her preferred mode of travel is the Chinese-language equivalent of the Greyhound bus tour.</p>
<p>With the largest ethnic Chinese population in North America, Toronto is hugely important to the ethnic tour market. While many North American cities may have one or maybe two Chinese language bus companies, Toronto has three. Tour guides speak Mandarin, Cantonese and English.</p>
<p>Prices vary, but we settled on three days and two nights for $229 including taxes. That's pretty cheap, and likely a better price than you'll find doing it yourself. The hotels include the Sheraton Centre in Montreal and the Delta in Quebec City.</p>
<p>Mom picks an outfit called <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> Tours because the name sounds reassuring.</p>
<p>"I think the buses are more safe," she says.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess that's better than booking Crash And Burn Tours," I snicker. She gives me a quizzical look.</p>
<p>Day 1</p>
<p>7: 30 a.m.: We meet our tour bus on a Monday in a crowded Scarborough mall near a Pizza Hut.</p>
<p>Our tour guide, Kenni, lays out the ground rules, including: "Please use the washroom only for emergencies. And whatever you do, please don't take off your shoes. That's just not cool."</p>
<p>Mom and I hop on, ready for our excellent adventure.</p>
<p>The bus of 54 passengers is a mixed bag of mainland Chinese visitors, an English couple from London who heard about the tour from a friend, and ethnic Chinese tourists from the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>9: 45 a.m.: First stop, Kingston. We pass a statue of John A. Macdonald. Kenni starts speaking in rapid-fire English, Cantonese and Mandarin. His language skills are exemplary. I was worried he would mangle Canadian history in front of tourists, but he actually did a fine job.</p>
<p>The tour does not include admissions and food, for which we forked out another $130. That buys you two lunches and a dinner.</p>
<p>Then there are the mandatory "tips" of $8 per person per day.</p>
<p>"What happens if you don't like the service?" whispers the lady in front of me to her daughter.</p>
<p>10: 45 a.m.: Lunch at <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>. My mom has brought three bags stuffed with enough food to feed the bus for three days. I eat a banana to lighten the load. For lunch Mom orders two Filet-o-Fish sandwiches, worried she wouldn't see another <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>. She eats them both.</p>
<p>Noon: Cruise around the 1,000 Islands. The islands are truly beautiful, but the boat crew of the Gananoque Boat Line is sullen. No one cracks a smile at the hordes of arriving bus passengers. No one says hello or bye as we are herded off like cattle.</p>
<p>2 p.m.: Ottawa. We jump off the bus for a 15-minute photo-op in front of the Parliament buildings.</p>
<p>"Where is the president?" asks an elderly lady.</p>
<p>"He's in the United States," says another passenger.</p>
<p>3 p.m.: Mom walks through the Museum of Civilization in 20 minutes. She obviously thinks the exhibits are an obstacle course on the way to finding the washroom.</p>
<p>7: 30 p.m.: The Montreal Sheraton Centre rooms are great and it's one block from Ste.-Catherine St. Day 2</p>
<p>6: 30 a.m.: Wake-up call then a tour of Montreal including Notre Dame Cathedral. We have 45 minutes to tour the Biodome, the indoor zoo on the site of the former Olympic Stadium. My mom zips through the exhibit as if she is on a seek-and-destroy mission. She misses the penguins. I buy a nutty cone.</p>
<p>Noon: Two <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> buses descend on Buffet Chinois Mandarin. We have one hour. The restaurant runs out of plates. People start to eat insanely fast. I start to shovel food in my mouth as quickly as I can after seeing everyone else do the same.</p>
<p>4 p.m.: Quebec City is gorgeous. But old Quebec is hilly. Tough on mom and her arthritis. We take it easy, but find it hard keeping up with Kenni's frenetic pace. He warns us some citizens are not tolerant of English speakers.</p>
<p>As we wander through the crowded cobblestone streets, people stare at the busloads of Asian tourists. I suddenly feel very foreign. I make up for it by yelling "Bonjour!" every chance I get. Mom tells me to shut up.</p>
<p>6 p.m.: We have paid for an "authentic" French dinner. The place is called the La Vielle Maison du Spaghetti.</p>
<p>At the old house of spaghetti you have a choice of meat and seafood dishes and lots of spaghetti drowned in gravy. Not so sure about the French thing. Cups are plastic and food is served on plastic trays.</p>
<p>"This is French food?" my mom asks. I worry that the tourists from mainland China are thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>Day 3</p>
<p>10: 30 a.m: The ride home. Nine hours in a bus watching America's Funniest Videos. Everyone laughs at kids bumping into stuff.</p>
<p>2 p.m.: Upper Canada Village. A huge, elaborate pioneer village with people dressed up in turn-of-the-century attire.</p>
<p>"Why are we seeing all these old buildings?" asks an elderly gentleman from Chicago, via Guangdong.</p>
<p>I tell him Canadians like old stuff.</p>
<p>"You could put a lot of houses on this land," he says.</p>
<p>7: 30 p.m.: We arrive back in Scarborough. I drop Mom off at her apartment. On my way home I stop at <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> to treat myself to a softee cone. My stomach rumbles.</p>

</p>
<p>A passion for science combined with a desire to work with people equals the perfect prescription for a successful career as a pharmacist.</p>
<p>It's a profession in high demand in B.C. as well in the rest of the world, and with pharmacists taking on additional roles to provide health-care services in the province, it's becoming an even more interesting career option.</p>
<p>Beginning this fall, B.C. pharmacists will be able to administer injections to patients -- including the H1N1 flu vaccine, which will reduce the pressure on doctors' offices and make it more convenient for people to protect themselves from the virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the province also gave pharmacists the authority to renew and alter prescriptions without first sending patients to their doctor's office.</p>
<p>"It's a really exciting and evolving career," says Marshall Moleschi, registrar of the B.C. College of Pharmacists. "Pharmacists are the medication experts in the health profession and there is a huge need for them.</p>
<p>"For people interested in the sciences, it's a profession where you can apply your knowledge and really interact with patients -- they are the most accessible health professionals."</p>
<p>Pharmacists are trained to ensure patients receive the most appropriate medications, and to see that prescriptions don't cause problems because of drug interactions.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a career in pharmacy meant working behind a raised counter in a neighbourhood drug store. Pharmacists may still decide to work in a drug store but many more are joining health-care teams at long-term care facilities, specialized clinics and hospitals.</p>
<p>And even in the local drug store, they are liaising with local clinics and increasing their services to patients at the counter.</p>
<p>"There are lots of opportunities," Moleschi says. "Pharmacists are getting more involved in direct patient care, in HIV clinics, diabetes programs, geriatrics."</p>
<p>B.C. has a continuing shortage of trained pharmacists, especially in communities outside Metro Vancouver, which will likely continue as the population ages.</p>
<p>Becoming a pharmacist takes five years at university to meet minimum requirements. Students interested in a specialty or hospital work pursue more training or complete a doctoral degree. Salaries for pharmacists start in the $50,000-to-$60,000 range, rising to $100,000 for those with advanced degrees.</p>
<p>Competition is fierce for a place in a university program in Canada, but a new facility at the University of B.C. will expand the number of spaces for students studying pharmaceutical science.</p>
<p>An additional 72 spaces, beginning in the fall of 2011, will also reduce the province's dependence on other provinces, and countries, to meet the demand for pharmacists here.</p>
<p>"We're trying to meet the needs for pharmacists in B.C. -- we can't do it at this point, but this is a big, bold step," says Dr. Robert Sindelar, dean of UBC's program.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Loewen, a professor with the UBC program and regional co-ordinator of pharmacy services for Vancouver area hospitals, says people who choose a career in pharmacy typically want to work in science but don't want to be confined to a laboratory.</p>
<p>"They want to be involved in health care, to interact directly with patients," Loewen says. "They want to improve people's health and well-being and develop relationships, but they're also looking for a science-based profession."</p>
<p>Shakeel Bhatti is a science-minded individual who also wanted to work with people and chose pharmacy to meet both needs.</p>
<p>"I've always been a social scientist," says Bhatti, who owns Murrayville Family Pharmacy in Langley, B.C. "I like people and I like science -- I think most pharmacists are like that."</p>
<p>Bhatti has been in the business for 23 years and has worked in community and hospital pharmacies.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, he jumped at an opportunity to own his own pharmacy and has now expanded to three locations in Langley.</p>
<p>While he enjoys the complexity of managing his patients' prescriptions, it's the relationships that make his work most satisfying.</p>
<p>"With every prescription, I have to talk to my patients, spend time with them, get to know who they are -- people often stay with their pharmacist for a lifetime," Bhatti says. "We have to know our patients just like the doctors so we can advise them about their medications."</p>
<p>Bhatti's goal is to care for his patients from cradle to grave, and he looks forward to being able to offer vaccines later this year as part of his pharmacy's practice.</p>
<p>"It has always been a social profession, but in the past, most interaction with patients has been verbal. Now we're laying hands on people -- I think it's way overdue."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico rich in tradition and culture; Fun-filled and affordable too, Mexico is the perfect getaway</b>
</div><div>Lisa Monforton </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1907 words</div><div>10 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>E8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>Ask anyone who's ever visited Mexico why they love it and keep going back, and you'll get a different answer every time: beach-hopping, sport fishing, mariachi music, mountain adventures, tequila tastings, or haggling with vendors at the flea markets. It's often for much simpler reasons: It's easy to get to and the price is right.</p>
<p>To be sure, Mexico has had its share of troubles this past year: drug wars in northern border cities, the economy taking an extended siesta and swine flu. As for the drug wars, most travellers know Mexico is a big place and that hundreds of miles and mountains separate the resort areas from the trouble spots. On the flu front, people are urged to take the usual precautions.</p>
<p>The economic slump, however, is actually working to the advantage of Canadians when it comes to finding bargains in the world's seventh most popular tourist destination. But, now more than ever, say Mexican tourism officials, this is the year to find deals. Here's a snapshot of some popular destinations along the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>- CABO SAN LUCAS</p>
<p>Cabo San Lucas' reputation precedes it as party central on the Mexico's Pacific Coast. The fact that the buzzing town at the tip of the Baja peninsula is only about 20 years old as a sun-seeker's destination might have something to do with it. Or because one of its nightclub owners is Sammy Hagar (former lead singer of Van Halen), who owns the Cabo Wabo Cantina at the centre of the nocturnal action. But it takes little effort to scratch beneath the surface of Cabo's tourist trappings to discover there's much more to this picturesque desert-meets-sea town.</p>
<p>You can easily choose to avoid the crowd whose mission it is to see how many tequila shots can be downed on a two-hour sunset party cruise on one of the many boats bobbing on the inky blue waters near the downtown marina.</p>
<p>The main attraction is Cabo's nature-made keyhole rock arch called Los Arcos and Playa del Amor (Lover's Beach), though it might be tough to find much privacy there. Beneath the water around the Baja peninsula, there live some 800 species of fish. On the surface, it's a playground for sport fishing, whale-watching, scuba diving, parasailing and kayaking.</p>
<p>The entire area of the southern Baja is called Los Cabos, which includes the more extroverted Cabo San Lucas conjoined by a 30-kilometre stretch of resorts, golf courses and shops known as the "corridor."</p>
<p>At the east cape, you'll find Cabos's much quieter sister city, San Jose del Cabo, with a more colonial flavour, family-owned restaurants and boutiques and dozens of art galleries.</p>
<p>This stretch, where the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Cortez meet, is popular for its natural beauty, abundant marine life -- which also include dolphins, sea lions and whales -- and 350 days a year of sunshine. It's also known as a luxe getaway for celebrities because of its proximity to California. In recent years, Cabo San Lucas has evolved into a more accessible destination for the average traveller, says Margie Gostyla, who represents a number of resort properties.</p>
<p>What's popping up are a variety of all-inclusive hotels which include the Riu Palace, Melia and Dreams resorts. At least a half a dozen additional resort/residential/golf developments are underway, most of them set to open by November or in early 2010. Acting on the tough year Mexico has had, the 30-plus hotels and resorts in the area have launched the "Los Cabos a la Carte" promotion until the end of the year. Travellers will find a menu of money-saving options like fourth nights free, complementary spa treatments and kids deals, golf and spa packages.</p>

<p>- IXTAPA-ZIHUATANEJO</p>
<p>The twin seaside beach resorts of Ixtapa-Zihuatnejo offer a more laid-back pace than many other Mexican resorts, and because of their differing personalities, it's evolved into a destination with a charming duality.</p>
<p>Ixtapa, (pronounced eesh-tah-pa) a planned resort community, was created in the '70s with a marina at the north end. A small cluster of hotels can be found here, as well as the 18-hole Marina Golf Course surrounded by boutiques and shops.</p>
<p>There are no towering complexes along the three-kilometre long Playa del Palmar, a wide expanse of golden sand, but rather low-rise resorts.</p>
<p>A few kilometres away in pretty Zihuatanejo (zee-wah-tan-EH-ho), tucked along the Zihuatanejo Bay, stroll along the Paseo del Pescador, the Fisherman's Walk, at a decidedly more unhurried pace. Fishermen will be hauling in their catches of the day, and many of the locally owned restaurants will serve up just caught mahi-mahi, shrimp or lobster.</p>

<p>- PUERTO VALLARTA</p>
<p>It's tough for any tourist city to cling to its authenticity, but Puerto Vallarta, a city of 350,000 people, manages to keep its Spanish roots piquant enough for the masses. The love story that put Puerto Vallarta on the world's tourist map involved Hollywood movie icons Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. As the oft-told story goes, Burton was working on John Huston's steamy film Night of the Iguana on the edge of town in the early '60s. Married to other people at the time, the pair had their own torrid affair going on. Burton bought Taylor a house (now a museum, restaurant and bed and breakfast: www.casakimberley.com[http://www.casakimberley.com]), and they continued to visit PV regularly.</p>
<p>It gave Puerto Vallarta, once a much slower paced fishing and silver mining town along Banderas Bay, a certain sheen and cachet.</p>
<p>Though, it's not the kind of destination that feels the need to reinvent itself every five years to keep the tourists coming, it's certainly not stuck in the '60s. As its sun-seeking visitors have evolved so has the city, but not so much as to lose its "Old Mexico" flavour. PV keeps one foot firmly planted in the past architecturally and culturally and the other preserving its heritage, wildlife and rugged mountain terrain.</p>
<p>A number of resorts have been participating in efforts to preserve the Olive Ridley sea turtles by collecting the eggs that are deposited along the shore from July to December. (Go to vallartanature.org for participating hotels.) Guests are invited to help out in this non-commercial tour, by either collecting the eggs or releasing them back into the sea.</p>
<p>Getting around PV is easy on city buses, that will take you north from Nuevo Vallarta, into Old Town and beyond to Mismaloya, where Night of the Iguana was filmed. It's also a short walk from here where you can get to Mama Lucia's handmade tequila factory. Tours, tastings and a boutique where you can buy the family's specialty tequilas, are open to the public every day except Sunday.</p>
<p>Away from the beach, venture into the jungles of the Sierra Madre mountains for more hard-core eco-adventures like zip-lining through the trees, and trail riding on ATVs or bikes. Outfitters such as vallarta-adventures.com, one of the most popular companies, has more than a dozen sea and land day trips, plus tours into some of Mexico's beautiful little mountain villages with colourful, sun-washed churches and bustling art, craft and food markets.</p>
<p>- MAZATLAN</p>
<p>If you're looking for a Mexican destination that offers a myriad of things to do, Mazatlan is a good option.</p>
<p>Like other resort destinations, the city boasts beaches, water sports and all the associated sun and surf activities. But visitors can also fill their days with history, tours, shopping and eco-adventures.</p>
<p>Hours can be spent checking out historical sites, statues and monuments across the city. A walking tour of the centre of the town, the "historic zone," is an ideal way to understand the background of this vacation destination.</p>
<p>Other can't-miss locales include the aquarium, featuring a shark tank; sport fishing tours; a stop at the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception; and, a visit to the second tallest lighthouse in the world.</p>
<p>The nightlife in Mazatlan is, well, let's say robust. One of the best places to sample a Pacifico is at Joe's Oyster Bar. This hopping spot is right on the beach and a favourite of those looking for a lively evening.</p>
<p>DID YOU KNOW?</p>
<p>- Cabo San Lucas</p>
<p>Cabo is considered the marlin fishing capital of the world, and home to the annual Bisbee Black & Blue Jackpot Marlin Tournament every October. Hundreds of sport fishermen come from around the world to compete for more than $4 million in prizes.</p>
<p>Lover's Beach is on the Sea of Cortez side of the peninsula while Divorce Beach fronts the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Baja is the third-largest peninsula in the world. The Sea of Cortez separates it from the rest of the country.</p>
<p>There are 10 championship golf courses in Los Cabos, three designed by Jack Nicklaus. Several more are set to open in 2010.</p>
<p>Cabo San Lucas is home to La Fabrica de Vidrio Soplado (Blown Glass Factory) where 35 artisans daily turn locally recycled glass into works of art. It's open to the public daily from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
<p>- Puerto Vallarta</p>
<p>Puerto Vallarta is in the Mexican state Jalisco, also where the town of Tequila is located, and where tequila was first created.</p>
<p>You're bound to see a real live iguana while visiting Puerto Vallarta (or anywhere in Mexico for that matter) so you should know a little about them: They have three eyes, two penises and do not perspire, no matter how hot it gets.</p>
<p>From Dec. 1 to 12 each year, people from the city and as far away as 16 km, march in a procession carrying lit candles to The Church of our Lady of Guadelupe, the centrepiece and heart of Old town Puerto Vallarta. It's known as the Procession of the Virgin of Guadelupe.</p>
<p>Puerto Vallarta is on the same latitude as Hawaii.</p>
<p>Just outside of PV is Punta Mita and the Four Seasons Pacifico golf course, which boasts the world's only golf green located on a natural island.</p>

<p>When an employee came back to work at <span class="companylink">McElhanney Land Surveys Ltd</span>. earlier this year after visiting Mexico, managers had the worker visit a doctor to be cleared before coming back to work to ensure the safety of its workforce and to allay fears.</p>
<p>That was the first wave. During the anticipated second wave this fall, that strategy won't work. Experts predict up to 30 per cent of the workforce could fall ill with the H1N1 influenza virus this fall and pandemic planners say most companies haven't done enough to prepare.</p>
<p>"All indications are that the swine flu will hit hard," says Bob Klay, a business continuity planner with Klay Management Ltd. "Too many companies are not very prepared."</p>
<p>Many companies are lulled into a false sense of preparedness because they have some kind of policy, but the devil is always in the details and execution is what really matters in a pandemic.</p>
<p>McElhanney's health, safety and environment manager, Darrell Florence, began developing a pandemic plan in 2006 after the appearance of avian flu, or H5N1. He knows there's lots of information and pandemic plans available, but says tailoring available plans to every individual organization is what will make the difference when flu hits.</p>
<p>"Off-the-shelf is a great place to start, but you have to identify the risks relative your own individual business," says Florence, who has employees working at remote work camps scattered across the province and office workers in Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p>His pandemic planning team brought in Juanita House, a registered nurse and occupational health and wellness specialist, to refine the company's pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"Anybody can get access to a pandemic policy ... and re-word it the way they want, but does it really work the way you want when it gets down to the implementation level? You have to bring it into the business and actually make it work for people," says House.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning guidelines are available through the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada and other organizations, but that's just a starting point from a business context.</p>
<p>Accuracy and execution are critical factors to any pandemic plan, says Klay. There are often many considerations people have not thought about or haven't addressed how to overcome.</p>
<p>"The problem with influenza ... is that you can be infectious, contagious, before you're symptomatic and that's where a lot of fear gets ratcheted up," says Pat Pitsel, president of consulting firm Pitsel and Associates.</p>
<p>Companies need to start with figuring out how to manage without a third of their staff, how to provide services to customers during the pandemic -- people tend to stay as isolated as possible -- identify critical positions in the company and cross-train to ensure continued operations and look at all aspects of operations and safety for workers.</p>
<p>Work refusals could become a problem for companies.</p>
<p>Security is another big risk, both physical security and information technology security. Many firms plan to let employees work from home, but that poses risks, too.</p>
<p>Florence and his team, for example, have developed a virtual private network that allows workers to log in securely at home to company servers from corporate laptops.</p>
<p>Pitsel says there have already been questions raised about the Internet's ability to handle the increased traffic from a third of the global workforce working remotely.</p>
<p>With every plan, it comes down to communication with employees and getting workers on-board with doing everything they can to minimize the risks.</p>

</p>
<p>I am way out of my league here. Skepticism, wisecracks, cynicism, zingers and gripes are the tools in the kit that came with the column, leaving me ill-equipped for this one weekend every year.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is the odd holiday out. It is not a religious occasion, like Easter is or Christmas ought to be. Nor is the second Monday of October political in the small-p, general sense of Canada Day or Labour Day. We do not honour special people, as we do fallen soldiers on Nov. 11 or the ones closest to us on Family Day. Yet Thanksgiving is not without expectations, no one-day break for fun and games and anything goes, such as Victoria Day or New Year's.</p>
<p>Far too much of my own life is wasted by the very contradiction of Thanksgiving. I am in awe of those folks for whom this Monday is merely a reaffirmation of how they approach every hour of life, with gratitude, with grace, with generosity for those who have less, and with no envy of those who have more. My mom was such a person, oddly enough.</p>
<p>The rest of us, we choose dissatisfaction. It fits better. It's easier.</p>
<p>We grumble about gas prices. Yet for $100 -- two days' pay, the wages from one shift, or even just a couple of hours at work, depending upon one's employment -- we can travel to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, in comfort, for pleasure, and in the time it takes for the rise and setting of a single sun. Only 150 years ago, a flit of time in human history, the same trip was a once-in-a-lifetime journey, a month-long ordeal.</p>
<p>We fret that we're not protected from the H1N1 virus. The flu that some of us have already suffered and survived, unknowingly, without diagnosis, is a niggling ailment against the likes of polio, tuberculosis and the Spanish influenza, the killing and crippling diseases in our province's history. This week researchers in British Columbia announced they had cracked a key DNA code for how malignant tumours spread in the damnable monster that is breast cancer, a story of hope that fell to the back pages of far too many Canadian newspapers.</p>
<p>We complain about winter's cruel cold. But we do need groceries, so we venture in parkas to the supermarket, where the aisles are stocked with fresh plumb vegetables from warmer climes and delicious fruits from faraway lands even warmer still. The banana, a rare and exotic delicacy during the childhoods of our grandparents and great-grandparents, costs less than the loose change in our pockets.</p>
<p>Big and small, we bemoan it all.</p>
<p>We are miserable when the year's biggest rock concert sells out before our chance to buy tickets. Our newest music box, the latest of many technological marvels, is not much larger than the jack of diamonds and, with no moving parts, stores three or four hundred tunes more than we'd ever think of downloading. In crystal-clear sound, Bruce Springsteen rocks Madison Square Garden or the London Philharmonic Orchestra brings to life a Tchaikovsky symphony at Royal Albert Hall -- and exclusively to our ears, while we're raking fall leaves or sorting the laundry.</p>
<p>We worry about retirement in times of economic uncertainty. The current life expectancy for a baby born today in Mozambique is 42 years. Money is only a piece of the puzzle of how to maintain after-work income for Canadians of my generation; that we now enjoy so much life after age 65 is a far greater complication.</p>
<p>We curse the mess made of our country by business, unions and politicians. In the United Nations' annual Human Development Index, a quality of life ranking released this week, Canada placed fourth among 182 countries. Of all the billions of people on this planet both past and present, we, right here, right now, are in the top one per cent for the enjoyment of human history's utmost in health, wealth and education.</p>
<p>We start every day with a hot shower, water we neither fetched nor heated. We no longer split wood for our winter's warmth, much less darn a sock. We use the word "starving" when we're running late from work, waiting for the potatoes to boil, and in an off-hand fashion that is almost, when you ponder the notion, despicable.</p>
<p>Not all is idyllic. Of course not. Life gives and life takes.</p>
<p>How many of us can truly say, though, that we are so hard done by that it's impossible in our current position to lend a hand or offer some comfort to another fellow with poorer health or lesser wherewithal?</p>
<p>We are so privileged.</p>
<p>There's only one final word that's appropriate here, out of character as it might seem.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p>
<p>Prepare for the pandemic, don't panic.</p>
<p>That's the message from Cindy Fuchs -- a woman in the know about emergency planning.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan provincial director of the Canadian Red Cross spoke about "H1N1 Preparation: An Employer's Responsibility" to a number of community-based organizations at the United Way's office on Friday morning.</p>
<p>The United Way asked the Red Cross to speak about pandemic preparedness because of the organization's history in dealing with emergencies.</p>
<p>"If you need to adjust (human resource) policies, best to do it ahead of time," Fuchs said. "You don't want to be making decisions in the middle of it because you'll have chaos in the workplace."</p>
<p>Health officials estimate between 25 and 35 per cent of the workforce could be ill during the second wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>"If you're sick, stay at home," Fuchs said.</p>
<p>Her organization practises what it preaches.</p>
<p>"When we're in the business of pandemic preparedness; we can't be the spreaders," she said. "If people are just coughing, but not really sick, the Red Cross has made sure that everybody has all of the equipment so that they actually work from home and they don't get behind."</p>
<p>She said employers must determine, in advance, what services are essential. "Can the service be stopped or scaled down for a few weeks because you won't have the number of people you usually do?" she asked.</p>
<p>Since employees might have to stay home to care for ill children or elderly family members, Fuchs recommends that staff check with their employers now to see if their absence would be considered paid leave.</p>
<p>She recommends placing bottles of hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes on each employee's desk, particularly if work areas are shared.</p>
<p>Pandemic preparations at home include preventing transmission of the virus and having adequate supplies in the event the outbreak is severe.</p>
<p>"You need to have enough food in your home for seven days because you may not be able to go out," Fuchs said.</p>
<p>Supplies should not require refrigeration, preparation or cooking and include pet food and bottled water -- a minimum of two litres of water per person per day.</p>
<p>"I'm sharing best practices from the Red Cross because we've done a lot of planning over the past two years in our own organization," Fuchs said.</p>
<p>Randall Torrie, the YMCA's manager of assets, was one of three Y employees to attend the presentation.</p>
<p>"We have upwards of 11,000 members who use our facility, so we want to protect them as best as we can and be prepared for whatever is coming down the pipeline," he said.</p>
<p>One of the steps the YMCA has taken to prepare for the pandemic is to upgrade sanitation in the facility.</p>
<p>"We have hand sanitizers around the building, we are using stronger disinfectants and paying closer attention to the cleanliness of the building," Torrie said.</p>
<p>Robyn Torrie, manager of child-care operations at the YMCA, attended the presentation to learn how to develop a comprehensive H1N1 plan to protect the day care's 255 children, who range in age from 12 months to six years.</p>
<p>"Right now, we're working on prevention measures," she said. "We have hand sanitizers for the parents to use when they walk into our facilities as well as daily disinfecting of surfaces. Children are the greatest germ spreaders."</p>

</p>
<p>The second wave of pandemic H1N1 influenza hasn't peaked, but it's creating all kinds of pressure -- including the possibility of financial shortfalls.</p>
<p>And that could affect society's most vulnerable.</p>
<p>While it's difficult to pinpoint when, or even if the virus will cause serious illness in Saskatchewan, health officials have predicted H1N1 will become more prevalent in the coming weeks -- the busiest and most crucial time of the year at United Way of Regina.</p>
<p>Currently, the organization is in the midst of its annual campaign.</p>
<p>"Between the end of September and the end of December, we're hoping to raise $3.8 million," said Joanne Grant, the organization's CEO.</p>
<p>"We raised $3.75 million last year and that was distributed to 34 agencies. If we miss the mark there, there's going to be an impact in the community." United Way funding benefits communitybased service organizations, which in turn provide programs and services to children, youths and families.</p>
<p>Organizations that rely on United Way donations include AIDS Programs South Saskatchewan, the Regina branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association, the Canadian Paraplegic Association, the Regina Early Learning Centre, Rainbow Youth Centre, John Howard Society and Mobile Crisis Services.</p>
<p>To prepare for the pandemic, Grant said the United Way is currently trying to determine what jobs are most critical to the success of the campaign.</p>
<p>"Everybody is in the process of reviewing what it is they do," she said. "You might be a receptionist most of the year, but if we're in a pandemic situation, you could find yourself becoming a campaign intern.</p>
<p>"We're so fortunate to have our campaign interns loaned to us from businesses throughout Regina, but if they get sick or their employers need to call them back because they're in a pandemic situation, we need to be able to fill in."</p>

<div>1111 words</div><div>10 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>As the winter chill sets in across northern Manitoba, remote First Nations communities are not only bracing for another long, cold winter, but also for a second wave of the H1N1 flu virus that wreaked such havoc among its people just months ago.</p>
<p>There, hundreds of kilometres north of Winnipeg, snow has already begun to fall. The lakes will soon freeze over, and communities that were once accessible by boat or plane will be mostly cut off from nearby airports, forced to rely on helicopters and spotty winter roads for a way in, and a way out.</p>
<p>Events over the last few months have cast these isolated and vulnerable reserves into the spotlight, at first because of the disproportionately fatal experiences of the spring and then more recently due to the grim mass shipment of body bags to Wasagamack First Nations.</p>
<p>Although a federal report released on Wednesday found that the shipment was, in fact, requested by the community's nursing station, the countrywide outcry -- however misplaced -- served to emphasize the remarkable challenges faced by remote First Nations reserves in fighting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>In northern Manitoba communities like Wasagamack, St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill, running water is a sparse luxury enjoyed by few, and the cold weather means swapping trips to the outhouse for indoor slop pails. More often than not, wood-burning ovens are the sole refuge from the cold for households that host upwards of four families at a time.</p>
<p>These are the conditions that allowed last spring's flu pandemic to flourish.</p>
<p>Aboriginals were airlifted away from their families, out of their communities and into Winnipeg hospitals. They comprised roughly two-thirds of those ventilated in intensive care units. Wednesday's Health</p>
<p>Canada report said that of the 891 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Manitoba to date, 335 cases were identified as First Nations or Metis people.</p>
<p>With flu season lurking, it is no wonder, then, that chiefs in Manitoba's remote First Nations communities fear what lies ahead.</p>
<p>"Chiefs here saw it for themselves every single day last spring, they saw how people suffered," said Grand Chief David Harper, who represents 30 of Manitoba's northern communities. "People who haven't seen this sort of pandemic for themselves don't know what we're up against."</p>
<p>Despite assurances from Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq that First Nations communities -- which fall under federal jurisdiction -- are prepared for a potential second wave, community leaders say they need more support, and soon.</p>
<p>"There aren't enough resources to protect ourselves as of right now," said Wasagamack's Chief Jerry Knott. "We have had to turn to traditional medicine in order to stay well or overcome sickness. Our elders boil roots from the river to prevent high fevers or help with a cough or a cold."</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point's Chief David McDougall, who lost his niece to the H1N1 virus earlier this year, said his fears for the health of his children, grandchildren, and community are very real. "We try to stay positive, but people here are scared," he said.</p>
<p>Chief McDougall's community -- population 3,521-- saw 122 confirmed cases of H1N1 last spring. Of those, 21 resulted in death.</p>
<p>There, just as in Grand Chief Harper's home community of Garden Hill, the sole school was shut down, the daycare closed its doors, and nursing stations ballooned well beyond capacity.</p>
<p>The breadth and severity of the outbreak in communities like St. Theresa Point prompted health officials across the country to augment their own staff and supplies, creating shortages in some regions.</p>
<p>"The spring was a huge wake-up call," said Grand Chief Ron Evans, of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. "We realized we couldn't let Health Canada handle this. We realized that we needed to utilize our own resources to do something for ourselves."</p>
<p>And so, in June, the assembly -- in partnership with the Province of Manitoba -- did something itself. With $1.5-million in provincial funding and after raising more than $15,000 in corporate donations, the organization put together 16,000 flu-prevention kits. One for each remote First Nations household in Manitoba.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 5,000 kits containing Tylenol, thermometers, hand-sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and basic information about the virus, were airlifted and then transferred by boat to the province's most at-risk reserves.</p>
<p>Although both the province and the assembly approached Health Canada to help fund the initiative, Ottawa declined.</p>
<p>"The medical officer has said that the kits were not necessary, and that people could get whatever they needed from the nursing station," said Manitoba's Minister of Health Theresa Oswald. "But there is some debate about that. Doctors across the country have said that it's a good idea to have a thermometer in the house to check a baby's temperature, and we agree."</p>
<p>Grand Chief Harper said he is "grateful" for the kits, but said there is much to do yet.</p>
<p>"By now, we would have liked to have field hospitals set up so our people don't have to wait to be airlifted to Winnipeg for treatment," he said, adding that there were about 100 Medivac flights to Winnipeg from Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point alone. "People would go 24 hours before seeing a doctor in Winnipeg, and that's just too long. But we have heard time and again that Health Canada will not fund the field hospital idea."</p>
<p>Grand Chief Harper said he and leaders from 30 northern Manitoba communities will meet next week in Le Pas, Man., for a "pandemic planning review."</p>
<p>"Health Canada says we're ready, but we'd like to compare notes," he said, adding that his mother developed flu-like symptoms on Saturday and, because the nursing station's only EKG machine was broken, she was airlifted to Winnipeg. "Of all the communities I represent, I'd say none are fully prepared."</p>
<p>Said Minister Oswald: "The very best kind of preparedness that we could have in Manitoba is to be healthy.... You cannot have optimal health when you have conditions of poor housing or a lack of running water. None of us should ever rest until these situations are rectified."</p>

<p>A few seconds is all it took, or in just about the time you could say "damn rain," St. Jean de Brebéuf Braves changed the complexion of the HWCAA football game.</p>
<p>The Braves scored a pair of third quarter touchdowns in less than 10 seconds to break open a 14-14 tie with Bishop Ryan Celtics and score a 28-14 victory.</p>
<p>"We had a few good moments for a big turnaround," said Braves head coach Steve Alfano.</p>
<p>The win improved the Braves' record to 3-2 and dropped the Celtics to 2-2.</p>
<p>The Brébeuf turnaround started when quarterback Jesse Mathews completed a pass at the Celtics' 25-yard line. A rough play penalty and an objectionable conduct call moved the ball to the five-yard line.</p>
<p>Receiver Mario Francis made a splendid catch in the end zone to give the Braves their first lead of the game.</p>
<p>On the ensuing kickoff, the Braves' Mike Andrade picked the ball off a carum from a Celtics leg and sped 20 yards for their second major in seconds.</p>
<p>Josh Oellcuch scored the Braves' other two touchdowns - one on a 60-yard romp on a punt return; and the other on a 10-yard pass from Mathews.</p>
<p>"Jesse Mathews made two good throws and two good choices," Alfano said. "That's what we need him to do a couple of times a game."</p>
<p>But it was the Braves defence that grabbed most of the coach's praise.</p>
<p>The Celtics scored on the opening kickoff when the Braves couldn't grab the slippery ball.</p>
<p>Celtics running back Ryan Kotar scored on a five-yard run for their other major.</p>
<p>"Defensively we only gave up one touchdown," Alfano said. "We gave up a stupid one on the opening kickoff, and then defensively we gave up one play. The defence played great."</p>
<p>Yesterday's game between St. Mary's Crusaders and Cardinal NewmanCardinals was cancelled due to a flu outbreak (not H1N1) at St. Mary's, which depleted an already small roster.</p>
<p>It is not known when, or if the game will be rescheduled.</p>

<p>The H1N1 influenza is changing the etiquette of greetings worldwide, and this Thanksgiving weekend hosts and guests alike need to take responsibility for creating a safe entertaining environment.</p>
<p>A guest who is feverish and has a cough should excuse himself from the meal. If that guest was contributing to the meal, it is best that the host offer a replacement dish.</p>
<p>Hosts who wish to have a "no handshake and kiss" greeting for their Thanksgiving dinner should use the following guidelines:</p>
<p>Greet everyone in the same manner during Thanksgiving dinner. Don't hug and kiss your neighbours and do the fist bump with your boss.</p>
<p>Warmly welcome guests with eye contact, a smile and a greeting. There's nothing wrong with a simple hug.</p>
<p>Here are some other options for greeting company.</p>
<p>- The mini head bow: It has been Donald's Trump preferred method of greeting for a long time.</p>
<p>- A hand wave: Picture the Queen's jaunty wave.</p>
<p>- The fist bump: The mayor of Memphis, Tennessee, greeted the Dalai Lama this way because one of his staff had recently been diagnosed with H1N1.</p>
<p>- Elbow to elbow: The ladies of ABC's The View have demonstrated this.</p>
<p>- Namaste: The yoga greeting with hands in front of the chest.</p>
<p>Hosts should take extra sanitary precautions throughout their home, including using drink identifiers such as wine charms, coloured swizzle sticks or straws. Use permanent markers to write names on beer cans or bottles. Ladles or prongs to serve munchies, veggies, fruits, appetizers and bread rolls is a good idea.</p>
<p>Prepare individual brochettes for fruits, veggies and hard cheeses in advance.</p>
<p>In washrooms, offer tissue, soap in pump bottles and hand sanitizers. Use individually rolled hand towels instead of one common towel. Good handwashing and cough/sneeze etiquette is always a must.</p>

<p>Clothing claims to protect against H1N1</p>
<p>MENSWEAR - For the executive who doesn't have time to come down with the flu, a Japanese company has invented a new form of protection--the anti-H1N1 suit.</p>
<p>Menswear company Haruyama Trading claims the suit can protect wearers from the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, as it is coated with titanium dioxide, a chemical commonly used in toothpaste and cosmetics and that breaks down when reacting with light, supposedly killing the virus upon contact.</p>
<p>Shinto Hirata, vice-director of merchandising at Haruyama, says the suit is proven to kill 40 per cent of the latest flu virus in about three hours and will retain its protective capability even after being washed several times.</p>
<p>"Small children might catch the virus after touching their father's suit. We came up with this idea to protect all businessmen and their families," he said.</p>
<p>Canadians flock to <span class="companylink">Google</span> Street Views</p>
<p>INTERNET - Visits to <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>.'s popular online mapping services more than doubled worldwide Wednesday when the Internet company launched its Street View image service of 11 Canadian cities, including Calgary.</p>
<p>The service provides curbside pictures of homes, neighbourhoods and attractions in cities--as well as some rural areas--around the world.</p>
<p>According to <span class="companylink">Google</span>, more than 28 million Street View images of various locations within Canadian cities were viewed on Wednesday alone.</p>
<p>The service has prompted debates about privacy.</p>
<p>After discussions with Canada's privacy commissioner, <span class="companylink">Google</span> agreed to blur faces and licence plates in its Canadian images taken by its camera cars.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a matter time, but the recent ruffling of feathers between the city chicken police and chicken huggers was inevitable. That's what you get when city aldermen insist on banning practices, behaviours and products that defies common sense and yes--the chickens have come home to roost.</p>
<p>The chicken folks who are defying the Calgary bylaw against their pets should be angry if for no other reason that it exposes a flagrant double standard. Calgary is home to countless thousands of yapping dogs, annoying cats, entire flocks of useless budgies and parrots, a plague of gerbils, vast schools of inedible goldfish and a plethora of horrid reptiles. So what have chickens done to be singled out for banning --a vegetarian conspiracy no doubt. It reminds one of the inane argument against the meat processing plant in the northeast--being it should be banned because its mere presence might offend a minority religious group.</p>
<p>Sure busybody city bureaucrats will tut-tut about the bylaw being designed to control odours and nuisance from farm animals. But that is a lot of bull fudge, there are cattle and horses happily grazing within the city limits and have done so for years. But then maybe its because city councillors have a fear of chickens (or is it a fear of henpecking)--its called Alektorophobia--clearly counselling is the answer. Come to think of it they could use counselling for a lot of reasons--maybe it will release deeply repressed feelings of common sense.</p>
<p>But before consumers afflicted by organicism and free-rangeitis rush out to buy a protest chicken to express their political solidarity with chicken loving outlaws, they should know that keeping chickens has some reality issues.</p>
<p>Firstly if you plan to treat them as anything besides a feathery pet you are fooling yourself. Yes they can produce eggs to eat but they are not free. Unless someone gives you a chicken, a ready to lay hen will cost you around $12 bucks. Then you need to construct a</p>
<p>facility to house and protect the precious birds. That's because if left outside they will sooner or later freeze to death or become lunch for the neighbourhood coyote or nasty tom cat.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of feeding them--they do not live on sunshine and love. Contrary to popular belief chickens are not vegetarians, they will eat bugs, worms, even meat scraps. Heck thanks to their dinosaur ancestry they have a cannibalistic streak and will even eat their own eggs and each other--which is the source of the term "pecking order." Once they have exhausted those sources of food the proud chicken owner has to buy high-protein expensive poultry feed usually from an out of town store. After all that and the hen hasn't just died from loneliness, been killed by a predator or been kidnapped by the city chicken police you would be lucky to clear 10 bucks in a year.</p>
<p>Did I mention egg production usually crashes after one year and there may be a need to recycle the hen into chicken soup. But wait --there is no doubt a city bylaw against killing your pet and having it for supper.</p>
<p>There is more of course --there is that nasty disease issue. Chickens can carry salmonella, that common food-borne pathogen that sickens and can kill humans. Chickens can also be carriers of Avian Flu--remember that was last year's media panic before being displaced by the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>One of the dangers of this bylaw dust-up is that city council will appoint a committee to review the matter. But given the bureaucrats affection for regulations we'll probably see chickens needing license tags around their necks and we'll need a million holding facility for runaway chickens.</p>
<p>But maybe consumers should be forced to keep a hen for a year--at least once in their life--that way most will probably come to realize how lucky they are to be able to buy safe, wholesome eggs and poultry meat at their local grocery store for some of the lowest prices in the world.</p>

<p>Just about the time the second wave of the H1N1 virus hits, many of us will be thinking about giving the north the frigid finger and booking a holiday in a hot place. That'll happen after several mornings of scraping icy windshields or trying to find that missing glove or scarf from last year.</p>
<p>Escaping the frosty temperatures doesn't mean you can dodge the illness. You can expect the virus to be lurking in crowded airports, on planes and in hotels. Sure, you can take the usual precautions, sneezing and coughing into the crook of your elbow, carefully washing hands and practising the knuckle bump instead of a handshake or hug. And getting the vaccine when it becomes available.</p>
<p>But there's one thing many of us often overlook in our haste to beat it to beaches and deserts: travel health insurance. We might be vigilant about arranging pet sitters and finding the most flattering bathing suit, but not so much at protecting the hard-earned investment in a precious holiday.</p>
<p>A 2008 Ipsos Reid poll conducted for RBC Insurance suggests the topic is not considered as sexy as the bikini you might buy for the trip. Here are a few highlights:</p>
<p>-Nearly 40 per cent of Canadians never purchase health insurance when travelling on holidays to the United States, where medical costs are some of the highest in the world. (If you've ever seen Michael Moore's documentary Sicko, you might change your mind.) According to the study, a four-day stay in a U.S. hospital for an appendectomy could cost $39,400 US, with only $1,600 Cdn covered by a government health insurance plan (GHIP). A one-day stay in a U.S. hospital for a broken arm and wrist could cost $32,600, with only $400 covered by a GHIP.</p>
<p>-In a similar study done the year before, it was found that 64 per cent have never purchased travel health insurance when travelling in Canada because a majority-- around 75 per cent --believe their provincial health insurance plans would cover everything. (Provincial plans often exclude X-rays, dental work, ambulance transportation and prescription drugs.) One example cited the cost of an air ambulance with a full medical team travelling from Calgary to Toronto; the $28,000 cost would not be covered by a government health insurance plan.</p>
<p>-Nearly 30 per cent have never purchased travel insurance when travelling outside of Canada or the United States, skewing toward 18-to 34-year-olds. Another common misconception is that certain credit cards that have travel health insurance cover all costs incurred for illness or injury while travelling. It's wise to read the fine print because this is often not the case.</p>
<p>Martha Turnbull, president of the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada, is a nurse and works as a claims assistant in the travel division of RBC Insurance. I asked her some travel insurance questions relating to H1N1, but the answers would apply to most infectious illnesses.</p>
<p>Q. With all the news about the second round of H1N1, would a traveller who has already booked a trip and bought travel medical insurance be reimbursed if they want to cancel because they are worried about contracting the illness?</p>
<p>A. Typically, no. People can't cancel because they are worried. It has to be a defined situation. In this case, it would be best to ask your travel agent. Most insurance policies would change the dates of travel. Or, if the policy had a "cancel for any reason" clause, the person might be entitled to some money back, but not all of it. It depends on the insurer.</p>
<p>Q. In June, the World Health Organization deemed H1N1 a pandemic. Will travel health policies still cover the illness?</p>
<p>A. I haven't heard of any instances (where it won't). I can only speak for RBC. (The pandemic classification) does not void any part of the policy.</p>
<p>Q. If I'm advised not to travel and stay in bed when I become ill at a destination, will I be reimbursed for the cost of my extended days in a hotel, plus other expenses incurred?</p>
<p>A. Each company would look at it differently. If someone was ill and was unable to travel home, they would be covered for hotel and food. This is an important point.</p>
<p>Trip cancellation or interference and health coverage will cover the cost to change travel arrangements.</p>
<p>INSURANCE FAST FACTS - Cost of insurance is usually based on no pre-existing health issues, length of trip and age. here's a couple of cost scenarios for travel health insurance, from rBC.</p>
<p>A deluxe package includes: cancellation and interruption coverage; emergency medical coverage; emergency medical transportation; baggage and personal effects coverage; flight accident and travel accident coverage. - Family of four, both parents under 60:</p>
<p>Trip: Seven days in Hawaii Value of trip: $4,000</p>
<p>Policy premium for deluxe package: $380 - Snowbird couple, both aged 65 trip: 60 days in Jamaica Value of trip: $6,000</p>
<p>Policy premium for deluxe package : $1,442</p>

</p>
<p>If you're eating organic turkey this weekend, savour it, because by next Thanksgiving it may be easier to buy crack cocaine in Ontario than a drug-free bird.</p>
<p>Here's why: While the turkey industry marketing board tells growers to confine their turkeys indoors to reduce the chance of transmission of viruses from wild birds, new organics standards administered by the Canadian Food and Inspection Agency mandate raising organic birds outdoors.</p>
<p>Caught in this Catch-22 are turkey farmers Matthew and Janice Dick - organic farmers who wanted their birds to roam free outside. They recently took on the Turkey Farmers of Ontario at an appeals tribunal in what amounted to a battle between antibiotic-free, open-air, small-scale farming and drug-intensive, confinement, factory farming. The organic farmers lost.</p>
<p>The Dicks raise birds on an 80-hectare certified organic farm in Markdale, about two hours northwest of Toronto, along with pigs, cattle, chickens and about a half-dozen organic crops. Their farm looks, well, a lot like the way farms used to look in Ontario.</p>
<p>Organic turkeys get about 25 per cent more space than in the industrial system and take 14 weeks to grow to about 10 or 12 pounds, compared with 10 weeks in a factory barn. They're also fed an organic vegetarian diet, with no genetically modified crops, antibiotics or animal by-products such as pig fat, blood or bone meal. Many organic livestock farmers also try to raise heritage breeds to increase genetic diversity, hardiness and flavour.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, the birds have full access to pasture so they can live a relatively natural life basking in fresh air and sunlight.</p>
<p>"You'll get a more natural taste with a bird on grass," Matthew says of the birds. "There's certainly more flavour to it."</p>
<p>He also argues access to outdoors is crucial for the health of the birds. "You give the turkey everything it requires: fresh air, outdoor exercise and no stress. If they run into a problem, they're going to have the immune system to deal with it. You just have to look at human flus. When you're in a confined situation, you're under more stress and things spread easier."</p>
<p>The Turkey Farmers of Ontario - an industry marketing board of 192 Ontario producers who control nearly half of Canada's annual quota production - introduced a rule last year that forces all quota holders to confine turkeys indoors, under a solid roof.</p>
<p>Turkey marketing boards, issuing quota to individual producers, were created to protect domestic farmers from imports. With this system, producers can also negotiate a fair price with processors.</p>
<p>Members of Turkey Farmers of Ontario produce more than 60 million kilograms of turkeys a year. The smallest of these confinement barns produce about 35,000 turkeys a year. The sector links an entire supply chain from <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span>, which processes 49 per cent of turkeys in Ontario, to Ontario-based Hybrid Turkeys, the only primary breeder in Canada and one of two major breeding companies worldwide.</p>
<p>The marketing board says raising turkeys indoors is one biosecure measure that prevents the transmission of avian influenza between turkeys and wild birds.</p>
<p>Ingrid DeVisser, chair of the board, said: "I don't think there is any foolproof method" of preventing transmission of avian flu. "But we're doing what we can to protect the industry." She pointed out that the Canadian Food and Inspection Agency is in conflict with itself: It advises, as a cautionary measure, raising birds indoors, but the agency-administered national organics standards, introduced in June, mandate raising organic birds outdoors.</p>
<p>The marketing board rule places organic turkey farmers in an impossible situation: To raise more than a backyard flock of 50 birds, farmers must hold board-regulated quota; but farmers cannot adhere to the regulations and keep organic certification. The rule change affects the Dicks and just one other organic turkey farmer in Ontario but it severely restricts the supply of certified organic birds, one reason they cost about twice as much as industrially raised turkeys.</p>
<p>The Organic Council of Ontario supported the Dicks' appeal at a tribunal of the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, concerned that the turkey board ruling would set a precedent for provincial marketing boards across Canada to introduce regulations for milk, egg and poultry production that would curtail organic production.</p>
<p>Already, the Canadian Poultry and Egg Processors Council has requested that all quota poultry be confined.</p>
<p>Ted Zettel, chair of the Organic Council, called the appeal hearing a "pathetic fiasco." Zettel said the Turkey Farmers of Ontario failed to present evidence of avian flu as a public health threat. "It's really clear that the problem that they have (with organics) is it's presented as a superior alternative and it makes them very vulnerable. They see no problem with trampling on the rights of a few farmers. It will be a pattern if they get away with it."</p>
<p>David Waltner-Toews, a professor at the University of Guelph's veterinary college, appeared as the only scientific witness at the hearing. The author of Food, Sex and Salmonella: Why Our Food is Making Us Sick is an international expert on food-borne diseases as well as diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans, such as avian influenza and swine flu.</p>
<p>He said the hearing was about the turkey board "protecting its commercial production units" rather than a "discussion about how we manage the system overall."</p>
<p>In its written decision, the tribunal said it recognized "the importance of the organic poultry industry and the high public demand for its product." However, it added: "It is our determination that the added cost of providing a covered structure for turkeys is far outweighed by the additional safety the TFO has put in place for the industry with the implementation of this regulation."</p>
<p>I visited a confinement barn, arranged by the Turkey Farmers of Ontario, to see how turkeys are raised in a biosecure setting. I've been to such biosecure barns before, and my first summer job was in an industrial barn, grading eggs and counting newly hatched chicks.</p>
<p>To protect flocks, biosecure confinement operations attempt to create a barrier between outside pathogens and livestock, or, as is the turkey board's chief concern, between wild birds potentially carrying avian flu and domestic turkeys. Toews told me earlier that there is no evidence such biosecurity works; indeed, the two previous cases of avian flu in Canada both broke out in confinement systems.</p>
<p>He said that once disease gets into densely stocked barns, it can run rampant, and sooner or later something always gets in. "Economies of scale are economies of disaster."</p>
<p>The operation I visited, Clark Poultry Farms, is certainly massive, with farms and cash crops in four counties. This location, west of Hamilton, has eight barns and raises 140,000 turkeys a year. Every eight weeks, 22,000 one-day-old poults arrive, to be pumped up into 16 or 17 kilogram birds destined for deli meat, processed by either <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span> or Sofina Foods.</p>
<p>Inside this barn, everything is impressively high-tech. Water, feeding, heat and ventilation are all computer-controlled, as farm manager Don Cryderman told me, "to simulate Mother Nature."</p>
<p>The turkeys, uncaged, are free to roam around a barn the size of a hockey rink. In practice, the densely packed birds waddle about a few square feet. As they near market weight, it will be a struggle for them to haul their enormous breasts beyond a few steps.</p>
<p>These barns are about production - turkeys gain a pound per week. Cryderman said it would be impossible to raise birds at this density without antibiotics to control disease. The medication is administered in the turkeys' feed for the first 10 weeks of life, though Cryderman said the drugs clear the birds' system well before slaughter.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but they never leave the environment, for one thing that this high-tech system can't biosecure is the manure of livestock. And in barns with thousands of birds, that output is enormous.</p>
<p>We enter the finishing barn, with about seven weeks of manure built up. With another seven weeks to go before these turkeys head to market around Thanksgiving, the smell of ammonia is a sharp stab between my eyes.</p>
<p>Turkeys stand on this dung, and other pathogens, throughout the production cycle. "Salmonella or other organisms are more likely to be shed in the feces, when birds are under stress," said Toews, "and in a confinement system, the birds are fairly stressed. That's spread to other birds in the slaughterhouse where thousands of birds come into contact with birds from hundreds of different farms."</p>
<p>Then, when the birds leave, that stew of manure is cleaned from the barn. And there goes biosecurity. Even if pathogens could be kept out, they can never be kept in.</p>
<p>The routine use of antibiotics in confinement barns is also a problem. The World Health Organization reported that 50 per cent of all antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals (due to increased intensity of meat production as well as for growth promotion) and recommended extensive reductions. Researchers at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health are assembling evidence that the practice is cultivating and spreading antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is finding its way from manure into soil, air, waterways and other organisms, and are widely implicated in creating the antibiotic-resistant superbugs in hospitals. (Every year, an estimated 220,000 people in Canada develop hospital-acquired infections.)</p>
<p>To keep their quota, the Dicks have confined their birds for now. (As a result, they'll lose their organic designation when they are next inspected.) The Organic Council is pressing for the tribunal decision to be overturned. That power rests with Leona Dombrowsky, the minister of agriculture, food and rural affairs, and so far, she has been unwilling to intervene. "I do have faith that the turkey farmers will give them fair consideration and will make the best decision for turkey farmers and consumers," she said.</p>
<p>Then she wondered aloud about a solution that would likely delight the Turkey Farmers of Ontario - that national organic certification standards be changed to accommodate confinement farming.</p>
<p>Attempts by industrial agriculture to erode organic standards is hardly novel. But what about bringing industrial farming up to organic standards? Now wouldn't that give us something to be thankful for?'Economies of scale are economies of disaster'</p>

<p>By planting this ancient "crop," which once covered much of Southern Ontario and is now one of the most endangered in North America, he is also showing that farmers can become leaders in combating climate change.</p>
<p>These native grasses thrive in draught, extreme heat and poor soils. The roots, which plunge up to 16 feet into the ground, can sequester as much as 1.8 metric tons of carbon per acre.</p>
<p>The extensive cover, up to seven feet high, can either feed livestock or produce a biofuel that regenerates year after year without damaging inputs, making it far superior to corn. So what the former tobacco farmer turned environmental visionary would also like to see when he looks out over his grand experiment is payment for producing not only food but clean air, water and soil.</p>
<p>Gilvesy is the chair of the Alternative Land Use Services (ALUS) project in Norfolk County, which is developing a new model for farm support that could shift Canadian agriculture into a greener future.</p>
<p>The farmer-driven initiative has cobbled together a small, $1 million budget from 16 funding sources to run a three-year pilot that pays farmers $150 annually for every acre they devote to ecological functions, the rental rate for cropland in the area.</p>
<p>"We need to pay farmers in order to engage them to protect nature," says Gilvesy. "Farmers are highly skilled water managers. Farmers understand soil. They're experts at sequestering carbon. Farmers are excellent stewards of the land. Paying farmers attaches a value on ecological services they provide that all of society benefits from."</p>
<p>The incentive is clearly effective. In just two growing seasons and with just one staff person, 53 farming families that work some 6,300 acres have managed to convert 438 of those most vulnerable acres into waterway buffers, wetlands, pollinator hedgerows, prairie grass and native Carolinian forest and oak savannah.</p>
<p>The project is a small green example of what agriculture, globally, must pursue on a grand scale. Agriculture and food production in North America and Europe are major contributors to greenhouse gasses (accounting for up to 20 per cent of emissions per country), and industrial agriculture is responsible for extensive degradation of the world's waterways. The European Union overhauled its agricultural subsidies to support environmental stewardship and ecological food production. But Canada's new agricultural policy, unveiled this year, remains stuck in the past, with no strong targets for reducing the sector's environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Implementing ALUS across Canada, according to a review commissioned by the Delta Waterfowl Foundation, would conserve 36 million acres of environmentally sensitive areas on private farmland - the size of the state of Michigan - and deliver $820 million in societal benefits through greenhouse gas sequestration alone. The work of Gilvesy and his band of Norfolk farmers has grabbed the attention of major conservation organizations, farming groups and local food enthusiasts. Last spring, 78 of them formed the Ontario ALUS Alliance to press for government funding to continue growing ALUS across the province. The Ontario government has resisted, and the program has generated little interest at the federal level.</p>
<p>Gilvesy remains undeterred. He sees ALUS as the future of farming. And he's far from alone.</p>
<p>The first major global assessment of agriculture, initiated by the World Bank and United Nations and delivered last year, called for a shift to ecological farming systems; payment to farmers for restoring land, soil and air, to ensure future harvests; and a new partnership between farmers and science to increase ecological food production rather than corporate profits.</p>
<p>Often dubbed agriculture's Kyoto, it concluded that Canada's dominant form of agriculture - high-input, energy-intensive, export-oriented industrial food production - was no longer a viable option as it causes soil and water degradation, increases deforestation, undermines rural livelihoods, and, if unchecked, will threaten future world food supplies.</p>
<p>The assessment won the support of 59 countries. Only three dissented: Canada, the United States and Australia. The Canadian government has all but buried the assessment, not even submitting it to the standing committee on agriculture and agri-food. That hardly surprises University of Toronto professor Harriet Friedman, one of hundreds of experts from around the world who developed the assessment. "All three countries have a high commitment to massive production of crops and livestock for export. When a certain production system becomes widespread, ministries develop to support it. But they'll have to shift fundamentally."</p>
<p>How that's done will require a major overhaul of the more than $8 billion Canada currently spends on agricultural programs.</p>
<p>The Harper government's new national policy for agriculture, "Growing Forward," merely bundles together old programs and includes no support for shifting agriculture into a greener future. According to University of Saskatchewan agricultural economics expert Murray Fulton, the policy sinks billions into income-stabilization programs that largely protect export commodity producers from world price fluctuations. Risk-management programs are "disaster subsidies" - bailouts for a system of agriculture that actually creates the conditions for those disasters, as industrial farming methods make animals and crops vulnerable to disease, pest infestations and drought.</p>
<p>The first outbreak of swine flu was in the Mexican village of La Gloria, which is surrounded by factory swine and poultry operations, and villagers complained for years about respiratory infections before the outbreak of the pandemic. Such tax-funded bailouts are not helping farmers become economically sustainable. Government programs and industry encouraged farmers to invest millions in expensive technology so they can produce more with less labour. Now Canadian farmers are staggering under a collective debt of more than $50 billion. But the profits, or even savings, have not flowed back to farmers. According to the National Farmers Union (NFU), net farm income plunged to zero this decade, while a whole supply chain that feeds off the work of farmers - food processors, retailers, chemical and seed companies, equipment dealers - harvested record profits.</p>
<p>What's required to change this, along with payment for environmental stewardship, is support for production of healthier foods and more ecologically farming methods. The shift to that is happening, if slowly, and it's partly the result of a surge in consumer demand for local and sustainable foods. Transitioning just 10 per cent of Ontario's cropped acres into organic production (from the current 1 per cent) would reduce the cost of agriculture by $2.18 billion over 15 years, according to a study commissioned by the Organic Agriculture Centre of Canada. Government support for the program would cost $51 billion, but farmers would save on expensive, damaging fertilizers and pesticides and also get an organic premium in the market, reducing other agriculture support payments to farmers.</p>
<p>Says Friedman: "We all live in this ecosystem. It's our collective responsibility to pay farmers if they're growing health food and providing ecosystem services for us. They get a good living, respect and skilful and interesting work producing food that can be afforded by everyone."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Removing waiting room reading material helps fight spread of flu</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>686 words</div><div>10 October 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The prominent notice at the front of a suite of Campus Estates Shopping Centre doctors' offices speaks volumes.</p>
<p>It reads: "Please use hand sanitizer before approaching reception area and please use a (surgical) mask if you have a cough. Thank you from physicians and staff."</p>
<p>Typical waiting-room magazines like Homes & Cottages and Today's Parent that can harbour germs were conspicuously absent, a patient Friday idly staring into space while waiting for his appointment at the south-side Stone Medical offices of Dr. Don McGhee and colleagues Drs. R.L Goldsmith and W.O. Goldsmith.</p>
<p>Front-line workers in the health care field are increasingly taking precautions against the spread of contagious infections during this potentially risky fall flu season, when the threat is a double whammy from seasonal influenza and the more virulent H1N1 variety that caused a pandemic in the spring and re-emerged in some countries this fall.</p>
<p>While staff at the medical centre was reluctant to speak to a reporter Friday, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health infectious diseases control manager Janice Walters praised such precautions in ambulatory settings like doctors' offices.</p>
<p>"I think it's excellent," Walters said, noting that's the kind of proactive approach her health board and the provincial Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care have been encouraging.</p>
<p>"It reinforces a lot of the message we're trying to tell people." Hand sanitizers are a good way to kill germs and surgical masks help prevent spread, Walters said. Influenza viruses are expelled in tiny water droplets as people sneeze or cough.</p>
<p>Dr. Nicola Mercer, the health board's medical officer of health, said removing magazines is a good idea because flu viruses can be contagious for up to eight hours on hard surfaces and even a few minutes on softer ones. Magazines are somewhere in between, allowing a window for infections to spread.</p>
<p>There's a large "stop" sign on the door to the downtown Norfolk Family Medical team advising patients with new or bad coughs, fever or shortness of breath to don masks and use sanitizers before entering.</p>
<p>At Guelph General Hospital, infection prevention and control co-ordinator Wendy James said magazines have been removed from waiting areas, as a safety step against not only flu but respiratory viruses that may circulate in enclosed public spaces. "It's that time of year," James said.</p>
<p>Signs at each of the hospital's three public entrances tell visitors "if you're coughing, put on a mask." Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are also available there along with these surgical masks. The gels are also available at staff entrances. Staff members, if sick, are encouraged to stay home. Those who are slightly ill with minor coughs or fevers can self-screen and may choose to wear masks as an extra precaution protecting their colleagues, James said.</p>
<p>"We're continuing with our pandemic planning," James added. That's because a second wave of H1N1 may sweep through Canada after an initial wave struck internationally in the spring, causing the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic in the summer.</p>
<p>Libraries are among other public spaces taking some initial measures. At the Wellington County Library, for example, cleaning staff have been reminded to be extra thorough with computers and countertops that get a lot of public use.</p>
<p>"Libraries see a huge volume of the public through their doors," said chief librarian Janice Hindley, who oversees 14 branches. Those branches have hand sanitizers in washrooms and at circulation desks. Other than that, it's currently "business as usual," she said.</p>
<p>The health board is presenting flu-focused public information nights in the weeks ahead. The next one is slated for 7 p.m. Oct. 14 at the Centre Wellington District High School, 905 Scotland St. in Fergus. Others in Erin, Mount Forest, Orangeville and Palmerston follow. The next one in Guelph is 7 p.m. Nov. 4 at Bishop Macdonell Catholic High School. More information is available at the health board's website: www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org].</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Trolling for the pandemic - Flu is a minor killer, but the preparations are immense</b>
</div><div>By Carol Sanders   </div>
<div>1672 words</div><div>10 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Silently, a sentinel is keeping watch over Winnipeg as authorities brace for a major outbreak of the H1N1 virus and practically everything else that can kill you.</p>
<p>Every time paramedics respond to a call, they enter the patient's symptoms into the First Watch database.</p>
<p>The software isn't just watching for symptoms of the H1N1 virus -- First Watch is noting gastrointestinal cases and neurological illnesses. If there's a problem with the food supply making people sick or another kind of infectious, viral outbreak, the system knows.</p>
<p>A "dashboard" on a computer monitor at the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service headquarters displays on gauges how close the city is to hitting the red zone -- when the number of calls exceeds the system's threshold.</p>
<p>A graph shows the average number of events in green, actual events in blue and the threshold in red. When the actual number of events spikes above the threshold, alerts are sent to city emergency officials' BlackBerry devices.</p>
<p>"We're able to put extra units on," said Christian Schmidt, assistant chief of operations.</p>
<p>Schmidt is one of the hundreds of city workers prepared to be redeployed if and when a major flu outbreak hits. At the height of the epidemic, up to 40 per cent of paramedics could be off work sick and as many as five could die, according to statistical models.</p>
<p>Schmidt said there could be huge demands on the system.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to do more with less," said Schmidt. Technology can help them to better deploy limited resources.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the city was using paper to report on patient calls. It would've taken days to sift through sheets and spot trends in illness, said Schmidt. Today, information is available in real time, and updated every three minutes. The fire paramedic service is passing daily information to the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and Manitoba Health.</p>
<p>"It's a huge step," said Schmidt.</p>
<p>On a computer monitor, they can see what's happening and exactly where. A map overlay of the city shows where the calls are coming from. Blue triangles indicate influenza-like illness, black represents fever and red indicates severe respiratory illness, the kind that can kill. The red-triangle patients -- likely H1N1 cases -- will probably end up on a ventilator and heavily sedated. It's so hard for them to breathe, it's said they feel like they're drowning.</p>
<p>A cluster of red triangles indicating severe respiratory illness on the First Watch map could prompt health officials to quarantine an area.</p>
<p>On an average summer day, Winnipeg paramedics responded to 135 calls in a 12-hour period.</p>
<p>"For a few weeks, we saw the number creep up to about 200," said Schmidt. "That was shortly after the World Health Organization alert. There was increased awareness and more people were sick or felt they were sick." Since that surge, things have settled down.</p>
<p>"We've had a fairly stable call volume," Schmidt said Thursday. "We're not seeing any peaks as of yet. We're also not experiencing an increase in employee absenteeism in the workplace," he said.</p>
<p>According to Health Canada's latest update Oct. 6, there have been no H1N1 deaths for weeks.</p>
<p>Since its first case reported this spring, seven people in Manitoba have died of H1N1-related illness.</p>
<p>In a typical year, up to 200 Manitobans die from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>That's why the province's chief public health officer Dr. Joel Kettner is still encouraging elderly and at-risk Manitobans to get their seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>People over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions typically are hit the hardest by seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But for younger, healthier people, there is a risk in getting the seasonal flu vaccine before the H1N1 flu shot, said Dr. Ethan Rubinstein, the head of infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>"If I was a healthy person, I would take the H1N1 (vaccine) first," Rubinstein said.</p>
<p>Animal experiments and some human cases have shown that getting the seasonal vaccine can "augment" a person's risk of getting hit with H1N1 virus, he said. Nobody knows why.</p>
<p>"That's the $64,000 question. There isn't any answer yet," said Rubinstein.</p>
<p>Kettner doesn't totally agree with Rubinstein.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, there is little if any evidence for the concern that getting the seasonal flu shot increases the chances for getting a severe case of pandemic influenza," he said.</p>
<p>"My advice to Manitobans is, if you have been recommended to get a flu shot before because you're over 65 or have a risk condition that increases your risk of getting severe influenza, then get the seasonal flu shot," said Kettner.</p>
<p>"We're going to get the (H1N1) vaccine as soon as we can, when it's been approved appropriately and safety and efficacy assessments are made," said Kettner. "We're gearing up to use it. We just don't know when that's going to be."</p>
<p>In the meantime, the pandemic hasn't been responsible for many deaths, Kettner said.</p>
<p>"Even in a worst-case scenario this fall and winter, it's quite possible it won't rival other causes of death in terms of numbers," he said.</p>
<p>"Ten thousand Manitobans die every year," said Kettner. "Around 100 to 200 die from seasonal flu complications," he said.</p>
<p>"That's still a small fraction of the number of people dying if you compare this to cancer, which causes one-quarter of all the deaths in Manitoba or heart disease, which causes a similar proportion, or motor-vehicle crashes or suicides," Kettner said.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada lists infectious diseases near the bottom of its Top Ten list of what kills you -- below "unintentional injuries" and "mental disorders."</p>
<p>In the U.S., the President's Council of Advisors anticipates that H1N1 may result in 30,000 to 90,000 deaths this year, much less than the 118,000 Americans who die in accidents in one year.</p>
<p>Still, the spectre of a global pandemic has prompted public agencies to ratchet up their vigilance.</p>
<p>"We have to be prepared," said Kettner. "It's possible it could be a much more challenging problem than in May and June." There was a "significant increase" in diseases in First Nations people and a lot of pressure on intensive care units in Manitoba.</p>
<p>"It raised a lot of concern about our capacity to deal with more severe disease." Prevention is key, he said.</p>
<p>"If we can reduce the number of people who need intensive care, then we're less likely to be in a situation where we can't give everyone the care they need (for) influenza."</p>
<p>Vaccines and covering sneezes can help to prevent the spread of the disease and people taking better care of themselves could help their bodies better react to the virus, said Kettner.</p>
<p>"Stop smoking, make sure if you have significant obesity that you get your weight down, if you have diabetes, then get it under better control... These could make the biggest difference between surviving pandemic influenza or not, and they're good things to do in and of themselves," said Kettner.</p>
<p>"The truth is premature death comes to people for a lot more reasons than infectious disease and influenza."</p>
<p>In Manitoba, poverty plays a big role in the spread of flu and public health.</p>
<p>"We can't just expect people to be healthy... if they live in a house with 10 other people and have no running water," Kettner said.</p>
<p>"Living conditions that promote health or are a barrier to health are playing out big-time in the pandemic," said Kettner.</p>
<p>In 1918, before there were such things as flu vaccines and standard indoor plumbing, the pandemic started with a mild H1N1 outbreak in the spring that resurfaced in November of that year, killing 50 million people worldwide, including 1,200 in Winnipeg. People in poorer areas had higher death rates.</p>
<p>Nowhere near that many people are expected to die from this year's H1N1 strain thanks to better public health care and improved living conditions.</p>
<p>The new pandemic seems to be following its old pattern, said Rubinstein.</p>
<p>The H1N1 outbreak that killed 78 in Canada this spring is, once again, coming back for more, he said.</p>
<p>"The West has been hit with another wave. B.C. has been hit with quite a severity," Rubinstein said Thursday.</p>
<p>The virus will likely spread eastward, Rubinstein said.</p>
<p>"People will cough on each other," he said.</p>
<p>carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Flu pandemics break out when</p>
<p>new strain arises</p>
<p>Flu pandemics occur whenever a new strain of the virus arises to which most people have no natural immunity. Experts believe they have been occurring at irregular intervals since at least the 16th century.</p>
<p>Scientists classify flu viruses according to their surface proteins: H for hemagluttinin and N for neuraminidase. There are 16 different H types and nine different N types -- numbers differentiate the strains, not the severity.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu pandemic that started in 1918 was possibly the deadliest outbreak of all time. It was first identified in the U.S., but became known as the Spanish flu because it received more media attention in Spain than in other countries, which were censoring the press during the First World War. The 1918 flu was an H1N1 strain -- different from the current one -- and struck mostly healthy young adults. More people died of influenza in a single year than in four years of the Black Death, the bubonic plague pandemic of 1347 to 1351.</p>
<p>In Canada in 2004, parasitic and infectious diseases like the flu claimed nearly 4,000 lives compared to circulatory-system disorders like heart disease that killed 72,743, cancer that killed 68,322, accidental injuries that killed 8,986 and mental disorders that led to 6,840 deaths.</p>

<p>They eat together, travel in a pack from city to city, room together, lift weights together, skate together, sweat together, and so far this season, the Toronto Maple Leafs have been losing hockey games together.</p>
<p>A pandemic of mediocre play by a team with playoff expectations has produced a 0-3 start.</p>
<p>Losing is an illness Leafs head coach Ron Wilson is confident his players can cure with hard work, attention to defensive detail, a show of courage from a crew of forwards that has been buzzing around the perimeter instead of crashing the enemy net, and better goaltending from starter Vesa Toskala.</p>
<p>These are the old-fashioned remedies for what ails the Leafs, who face the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins tonight (7 p.m., CBC).</p>
<p>But there is new sickness lurking beyond the control of any coach.</p>
<p>It is a sickness no amount of practice can shake, and one that could conceivably send the Leafs into a funk far worse than the one they are already in.</p>
<p>"The last time I had the flu was when I was in Vancouver," Leafs general manager Brian Burke said.</p>
<p>"There is nothing you can do, just stay in bed for 24 hours, and that is about the full cycle."</p>
<p>But the H1N1 virus, or swine flu, is a whole new flu. And ordinary people -- and NHL players -- have not been vaccinated for it yet and possess no natural immunity against it.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Schabas, the medical officer for Hastings and Prince Edward Counties and the former chief medical officer of Ontario, was watching from afar while the flu ran its course in the southern hemisphere. He says a comprehensive study of H1N1 has just emerged from New Zealand. Researchers there indicate it has a "five per cent clinical attack rate," meaning about one in 20 New Zealanders were felled by it.</p>
<p>"That one in 20 can happen in clusters," Dr. Schabas said. "And obviously, if it gets into a team situation and four or five players get sick at once, it could have serious consequences -- especially for (the Leafs) -- given their precarious standing."</p>
<p>Toronto plans on stocking its team medical cabinet with a sufficient amount of swine flu vaccine once it becomes available in November. It will be used to inoculate the players, their families and team personnel.</p>
<p>Mike Komisarek was well acquainted with what a queasy tummy, chattering teeth and a high fever can do to a hockey team with Montreal in 2007.</p>
<p>Ground zero for the Canadiens was a game against Washington in early January. One of the players became violently ill in the dressing room. Two more became sick on the flight home.</p>
<p>"That night, I woke up with the severe flu," Komisarek said.</p>
<p>Komisarek is not sure what he is going to do this season to ward off H1N1.</p>
<p>He knows the vaccine is on its way, but wants more information about the flu shot before he rolls up his sleeve for a team doctor.</p>
<p>Toronto has taken preventive steps to stop an outbreak, such as stocking the dressing room with hand sanitizer and having each player drink from his own water bottle during practice.</p>

</p>
<p>Summer is behind us and the fall flu season is about to begin. The H1N1 flu strain is waiting in the wings and we're waiting to see how it all works out.</p>
<p>Signs are starting to show already.</p>
<p>In the spring and summer, H1N1 had an impact in northern Manitoba. Now it is being felt in such diverse places as the Ahousaht band on Vancouver Island and the Dehcho First Nation in the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>So can we expect First Nations people to be harder hit than the rest of the country? If history is any indicator, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>The 1918 flu pandemic took a terrible toll on native people. The First Nations population of Canada dropped to around 100,000 after that pandemic. Communities that had been hit hard by smallpox and other diseases were greatly reduced and, in some cases, ceased to exist. The early indications are that, once gain, we will bear the brunt of this pandemic.</p>
<p>The reason is simple. Our people live in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Our more remote communities that lack basic infrastructure have been hit the hardest. Ground zero for the pandemic might well be aboriginal communities, not the cities.</p>
<p>One theory making the rounds suggests that aboriginal people are more susceptible to diseases that are foreign to Canada. This might have been true in the past, but most aboriginal people today are descendants of those who survived foreign-introduced diseases and their immune systems should be up to the task.</p>
<p>The difference lies with our living conditions. Poverty breeds disease. Overcrowded and poor quality housing and a lack of proper sewer and water services all combine to provide the H1N1 virus with a welcome environment.</p>
<p>The federal government's response has been hit and miss. Bone-headed moves such as the refusal to send hand sanitizers to some northern communities because of the alcohol content and the infamous body bag issue have tried the patience of our leaders and are just plain stupid and bad PR.</p>
<p>The federal government so far has spent five times more on ads that promote its economic plan than it has on an H1N1 information program.</p>
<p>The recent announcement by the health minister that she'll work with the Assembly of First Nations and increase communications between the First Nations and the health department is a positive step.</p>
<p>Health is among the issues that are jurisdictional minefields for our people. Under the British North America Act, health care is a provincial responsibility, but the same act designates "Indians and lands reserves for Indians" as a federal responsibility.</p>
<p>The result has been that the health care portion has been transferred to provincial medicare programs, but much of the preventive health measures on reserves and health education functions remain with Ottawa.</p>
<p>If and when the H1N1 flu pandemic hits, the provinces will care for the patients in the hospitals, while the on-reserve response remains up to the federal government.</p>
<p>Too often the jurisdictions are confused and there is either overlap or a vacuum -- more often the latter.</p>
<p>Today all Canadians receive health care, which is delivered by the provincial medicare programs. However we need the federal government to step up and deliver health care programs on reserves. Health care is not just treatment, but prevention.</p>
<p>However, federal infrastructure programs have bypassed many of the aboriginal communities that need them the most. There now is a feeding frenzy elsewhere for the infrastructure dollars.</p>
<p>Minority governments are famously short-sighted as they fight for survival. This does not bode well for aboriginal communities, which need long-term planning and serious improvements in infrastructure.</p>
<p>In a few months the H1N1 threat will be over, but the diseases of poverty will remain in the First Nations and aboriginal communities. We have other epidemics -- with diabetes, AIDS, drug and alcohol abuse running rampant in Indian Country. The rest of the world may move on, but for us the crisis will continue.</p>

</p>
<p>Days after a Cranbrook woman died from H1N1, health officials say obesity may be an additional risk factor for people who get the flu.</p>
<p>Susan Marsh, 25, died in a Calgary hospital Tuesday four days after becoming infected with H1N1.</p>
<p>Several news reports have quoted unnamed medical officials as saying obesity may have been a contributing factor in her death.</p>
<p>Provincial Health Officer Dr. Perry Kendall said obesity is typically a "co-occurring risk factor" because patients may have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.</p>
<p>It's unknown how many of the 64 British Columbians who have contracted H1N1 since April are obese. Of those infected, seven have died.</p>
<p>But Kendall said people who are overweight are at a greater risk of complications from H1N1 including pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Kendall would not comment on the details surrounding Marsh's death, citing privacy reasons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine Thursday tracked obesity as a factor in H1N1 in hospitals in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S. noted obesity in 45 per cent of their cases where data was available. Similarly, obesity occurred in 29 per cent of Australian and New Zealand cases tracked in hospitals from June through August.</p>

<p>Hand sanitizers won't be showing up in Vancouver schools to fight the swine flu because authorities are worried students will eat it, drink it or set it and themselves on fire.</p>
<p>David Weir, communications manager for the Vancouver School Board, said the board made the decision in August, after consulting with officials at the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority.</p>
<p>Weir noted many hand-sanitizer gels are 60-per-cent alcohol.</p>
<p>"When you look at the bottom of the bottle, many manufacturers have put a warning on them saying, 'Keep out of reach of children,'" said Weir.</p>
<p>He said the same warning appears on alcohol-free sanitizers.</p>
<p>The popular website <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> features dozens of videos under the heading "hand sanitizer fire fun," showing youth gleefully setting the gel and themselves on fire.</p>
<p>There are also worries that children may ingest the gel in an attempt to experiment with the effects of alcohol, only to wind up in a hospital emergency ward.</p>
<p>"Because of the alcohol content, we're concerned about students drinking it, eating it, sniffing it, doing a variety of things," said Weir.</p>
<p>The school board has decided to pound home the message that frequent hand-washing is the best way to halt the H1N1 flu virus, which has contributed to the deaths of seven British Columbians this year.</p>
<p>"The preferred method of cleaning your hands to prevent the spread of viruses is actually washing with soap and water," said Weir.</p>
<p>He said VSB won't ban bottles of hand sanitizer for personal use.</p>
<p>"Parents are free to choose to give their children a bottle for personal use, but if staff see them being misused, staff will confiscate it and parents will be contacted," said Weir.</p>
<p>In Surrey, the province's biggest school board is deploying hand sanitizers sparingly, and also recommending washing hands with soap and water.</p>
<p>Vancouver School Board has no plans to close schools in the event of a severe flu outbreak, said Weir, noting it won't stop the spread of flu in the community, where children likely would congregate.</p>
<p>Surrey will rely on Fraser Health's recommendations on school closures. aivens@theprovince.com</p>

<p>People with high medical needs or those travelling around the equator will be able to roll up their sleeves at Regina's Travel Health Centre after Oct. 26.</p>
<p>"We will be providing services to those people who are going to countries requiring the yellow fever vaccine because we are the only place in southern Saskatchewan where you can access that," said Donna Martin, nursing supervisor of the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's Travel Health Centre.</p>
<p>Every month, 30 to 60 people are immunized for yellow fever, which is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs predominantly across Central Africa and the Amazon.</p>
<p>"That's the only one that has international requirements to get you in and out of country," Martin said.</p>
<p>"That's why we feel it is a must to continue that service."</p>
<p>One nurse will also provide immunizations for clients with high medical risks -- such as people who are immune-compromised or have had transplants.</p>
<p>"We'd also try to accommodate people who are going on long-term travel where they are going to numerous countries where there's high risk," Martin said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the RQHR announced that services at the</p>
<p>Travel Health Centre will ramp up until Oct. 26 to accommodate winter travellers, and then will be scaled back so public health nurses can be redeployed to work at H1N1 immunization clinics. After Oct. 26, residents who believe they qualify for services at the Travel Health Centre can call 766-7600.</p>
<p>"We would go through a series of questions to determine whether they are someone we should accommodate or not," Martin said.</p>
<p>"If we can't accommodate them, what we suggest is that they should check with their family physician or another physician who might be able to help them.</p>
<p>"We're sending information to family physicians to help them facilitate that service."</p>
<p>Full services at the Travel Health Centre will be reinstated once the H1N1 immunizations are done.</p>

<p>How "germy" are your hands? Seeing is believing.</p>
<p>Cheryl Colhoun, a frequent handwasher, was surprised when the Glow Germ's ultraviolet light scanned the inside of her hand and highlighted germs in the creases.</p>
<p>"Handwashing obviously helps some, but it's not foolproof," said the project co-ordinator with the <span class="companylink">Co-operators Life Insurance Company</span>. "Even just walking down the stairs and touching a bannister or a meeting room table, who knows what you're picking up there."</p>
<p>The Glow Germ, on loan from the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, was demonstrated at the Co-operators' pandemic booth -- one of 34 displays at the wellness fair held at the College Avenue business on Thursday.</p>
<p>"With the information that's out there about the flu season and H1N1, washing your hands is really important," said Shannon Patton, the company's wellness and diversity co-ordinator. "The Glow Germ is there to show them what happens when you don't."</p>
<p>Information sheets at the booth instructed employees to protect themselves and their families from the H1N1 virus and the seasonal influenza by frequently cleaning their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Employees are instructed to thoroughly lather up hands, wrists and forearms with soap for at least 20 seconds and then use a paper towel to turn off the tap.</p>
<p>In the past, Co-operators has held health fairs for its 700 employees, but this year the focus expanded to body, mind and spirit.</p>
<p>Brenda King, a paralegal with the company, was intrigued by the Xocai Chocolate booth where three squares of chocolate were touted to be the nutritional equivalent of eating six pounds of tomatoes or 1.91 pounds of spinach.</p>
<p>"It's pretty amazing that you're getting the health benefits of tomatoes or spinach in a piece of chocolate," King said.</p>
<p>Claudia Lutzek, an independent distributor from Winnipeg, explained the chocolate is healthy because of what isn't in it.</p>
<p>"There's no added fat, no wax, no fillers, there's no caffeine -- it's diabetic-friendly, there's no refined sugars in it," she said. "As well, they have a patent on a cold-press process, so we don't heat the chocolate like other manufacturers do and we're able to retain all of the high antioxidant properties that the cocoa bean contains."</p>
<p>Wellness isn't a one-day concern at the Co-operators. An onsite gym and many fitness programs are available to employees throughout the year, including aerobic classes, a six-week fitness boot camp and circuit training.</p>
<p>Every Thursday, a massage therapist comes to the building to give staff 15-minute chair massages to keep them limber.</p>
<p>Physical activity for employees and their families is promoted at events. To help employees balance their personal and work lives, they are allowed three personal days throughout the year and they can work flex hours.</p>
<p>"With everybody being really busy, it's very important for us as a company to try and help in ways that we can," Patton said. "A healthy work environment is a productive work environment.</p>
<p>"The healthier employees are, the happier they are -- and the more they want to be at work."</p>

</p>
<p>OC Transpo has reversed a decision to deny drivers' requests for leave or time off, making clear to union leaders Wednesday that employees can stay home if they are sick.</p>
<p>City spokesman Michael FitzPatrick wouldn't say if the policy has been changed or modified, telling the Citizen that OC Transpo "doesn't publicly discuss personnel matters with the media."</p>
<p>Transit union president André Cornellier, however, confirmed the city's policy U-turn, following union complaints that the policy would force sick employees to go to work.</p>
<p>"They said it was a misunderstanding. They revised it, they changed it to say that if you are sick, you stay home," Cornellier said Thursday. "I am very happy with the meeting I had with them yesterday. They understood that my members don't have to come to work if they are sick."</p>
<p>Following a sharp rise in absenteeism, OC Transpo last week announced it would no longer grant requests for leave until absenteeism rates improve.</p>
<p>In a leaked memo, Transpo general manager Alain Mercier told councillors the company would refuse to grant special permission days, split vacation or leave requests until absenteeism was brought down to acceptable levels.</p>
<p>The transit union protested loudly, saying the new policy would force drivers and mechanics to go to work even if they were ill, a dangerous situation in the era of H1N1 swine flu.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stop the conflusion: Here are the H1N1 facts</b>

 </div>
</p>
<p>Conflusion.</p>
<p>The Urban Dictionary defines the term as follows: “The aggregation or streaming together of multiple confusing items, as in a confluence of confusion.”</p>
<p>It's time for a second entry.</p>
<p>Conflusion is what the public is feeling in response to the seemingly endless stream of contradictory news about H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the conflusion more acute than when it comes to vaccination.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the public has been told, in rapid succession, that:</p>
<p>• The best protection against the flu is to wash your hands.</p>
<p>• There will be enough H1N1 vaccine for everyone by October, in plenty of time for flu season.</p>
<p>• It's important to get vaccinated for both H1N1 and seasonal influenza because there is no overlap in protection.</p>
<p>• People who get seasonal flu vaccine are at higher risk of contracting H1N1, so a number of provinces are suspending seasonal flu vaccine programs.</p>
<p>• It is best to only get the H1N1 vaccine because it has become the dominant strain, but maybe the seasonal flu vaccine program will be rolled out later.</p>
<p>The flu season has begun early and the H1N1 vaccine won't actually be ready until November.</p>
<p>• Those who get seasonal flu vaccine are actually at lesser risk of contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>• Washing your hands doesn't actually prevent transmission of the flu.</p>
<p>Yikes. That is a confluence of confusion if there ever was one.</p>
<p>And this is merely an overview of the big-picture issues. There are equally divergent views on the vaccine production methods (using adjuvants, as is done in Canada, compared with no adjuvants, the chosen course in the United States), the adequacy of clinical trials to ensure safety, whether H1N1 vaccine will be a single dose or multiple dose formulation (if it is the latter, it will contain the mercury-based preservative thimerosal) and so on.</p>
<p>You may well be asking yourself: Can't scientists and public-health officials get their act together? And what are we, mere mortals, to do with this mess of information?</p>
<p>First, it should be said that what is going on is normal – or at least it's the normal scientific process, where hypotheses are put forward and shot down, and policies defined then refined.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that these scientific debates, often revolving around fairly technical matters, are being played out in public without context and without a common language.</p>
<p>Scientific language is cautious, technical and precise, often to the point that, paradoxically, it is incomprehensibly fraught with uncertainty. (It is no coincidence that the conclusion of every study is that more study is needed.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, the public – and the media more specifically – yearn for certainty. They want simple, black-and-white answers to straightforward questions: Is this H1N1 a real threat? Should I get vaccinated? Is the vaccine safe?</p>
<p>The role of public-health officials should be as a bridge between the two, a translator if you will.</p>
<p>But public health has fallen down on the communications job. Beyond the repeated and painfully detailed admonitions to wash our hands, public-health officials have not provided the digestible morsels of information that the public needs.</p>
<p>They have not mastered the all-important skill of conveying uncertainty with clarity.</p>
<p>Rather, they have flip-flopped around like fish out of water, exasperating scientists and the public alike and creating rather than clearing up confusion.</p>
<p>In fairness, this is a complex issue and scientific knowledge is changing constantly. More often than not scientific disagreements are of the how many angels can dance on a pinhead sort. The debates and the discussion need to take place, and the nitty-gritty details should be available to those who want to delve deep into the finer points of H1N1.</p>
<p>But there is pretty broad consensus on the essential stuff. Politicians and public-health officials, however, have demonstrated a seeming inability to separate the wheat from the chaff and communicate vital information concisely.</p>
<p>That has been the principal source of conflusion.</p>
<p>So here, in a few brief words, is the essential of what you need to know about pandemic influenza:</p>
<p>• H1N1 is a new virus so a lot of people will contract it. As many as one in three Canadians could fall sick with H1N1 if they are not vaccinated.</p>
<p>• The good news is that, so far, disease caused by H1N1 has been relatively mild. A small percentage – but significant number – of people will get very sick and some will die.</p>
<p>• Those at greatest risk of getting sick are pregnant women and people (especially children) with chronic medical conditions such as asthma.</p>
<p>• Healthy young adults seem to get a lot sicker from H1N1 than they do from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>• There's going to be a H1N1 vaccine available in a few weeks. It's a good idea to get it to avoid getting sick and infecting others.</p>
<p>• It's also wise to get the seasonal flu vaccine. The “normal” flu sickens many and kills about 5,000 people a year, most of them seniors.</p>
<p>• These vaccines are free.</p>
<p>• Handwashing is an effective way of reducing the spread of germs, including H1N1 virus. Staying home when you're sick is another way to avoid spreading illness.</p>
<p>• H1N1 is not the only disease out there. Even if you get the vaccine, you may get sick.</p>
<p>• Every effort is being made to ensure the H1N1 vaccine is safe, but every drug has potential side effects. Experts believe that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Are you still conflused?</p>

<p>A Canadian Press-Harris Decima poll suggests the number of Canadians who plan to get the H1N1 vaccine has dropped since the summer.</p>
<p>Pollster Doug Anderson says the finding isn't surprising given recent stories on contradictory advice around vaccination. But Anderson also cites a lack of concern about getting swine flu for the results.</p>
<p>The poll found only a third of respondents said they plan to get vaccinated when the H1N1 shots are available - down from 45 per cent in a similar survey in August.</p>
<p>It also found only 11 per cent are very concerned about contracting H1N1 - while 36 per cent said they're somewhat concerned.</p>

<p>Dr. Didi Emokpare of Regina said rates of hepatitis C have risen 114 per cent among Canadian women between 2006 and 2008, and by 76.6 per cent among men--and it's believed the numbers could be much greater because the disease is under-diagnosed.</p>
<p>"This is very silent, staggering number," said Emokpare, noting there's been very little attention paid to the potentially deadly hepatitis C virus (HCV). "It's like it doesn't even exist."</p>
<p>Emokpare is urging more screening for HCV, which can go undetected for decades, since it may not lead to illness in its early stages. But detection, through a simple blood test, is important, because HCV can be treated and cured, he said.</p>
<p>"If you don't look for it, you won't find it," Emokpare added.</p>
<p>Emokpare was speaking in Regina recently to those gathered for The Changing Face of AIDS, organized by AIDS Programs South Saskatchewan. Emokpare is executive director of the Lazarus Foundation, a non-profit group working to prevent and eradicate HIV/AIDS and its related disease conditions.</p>
<p>Five to 10 years ago, tuberculosis was one of the key killers of those infected with HIV; today, they're likely to die of hepatitis C, said Emokpare. In its later stages, hepatitis C, which is carried in the blood, can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer.</p>
<p>"This is the new thing that's guaranteed to kill you (those who have HIV/AIDS)," said Emokpare, adding about 30 per cent of people with HIV are also infected with HCV.</p>
<p>In Canada, about 300,000 people, mostly aged 25 to 45, have HCV; about 8,000 Canadians are infected every year.</p>
<p>The doctor suggested rates of hepatitis C now are where HIV was in the 1980s.</p>
<p>"This is a big deal."</p>
<p>In Canada, the highest hepatitis risk comes from sharing needles and other drug-using equipment. But Emokpare said that, because many people who have HCV don't know it and aren't taking precautions, the disease is being spread outside of the drug subculture.</p>

</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>The federal government has not pinpointed a date to roll out the H1N1 vaccine in October, contrary to what a media report suggested Thursday.</p>
<p>The report indicated that the federal government was making plans to begin shipping doses of the vaccine to the provinces and territories on Oct. 19 in order for it to be ready for distribution on Oct. 26.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq confirmed to Canwest News Service that the federal government is still aiming to have the vaccine ready in the first week of November.</p>
<p>Tim Vail, the minister's director of communications, said various scenarios have been discussed with the provinces about when they could start immunization programs, and Oct. 26 was one date proposed. He said, however, that provinces would only be able to start vaccinating people then if certain variables--such as when Health Canada will approve the vaccine--were known.</p>
<p>Clinical trial data needs to be reviewed first before Health Canada can approve the vaccine, and that data are not yet in the hands of the regulator. After the vaccine is approved by Health Canada it will be shipped out from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>'s factory in Quebec.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons Thursday, Aglukkaq responded to questions about the vaccine timeline and stuck to early November.</p>
<p>In an e-mail to Canwest News Service on Thursday, a senior media relations adviser for the Public Health Agency of Canada also reiterated that the timetable is not being moved up at this point.</p>
<p>The opposition parties have been attacking the government this week over the timeline for the vaccine, saying that it is coming too late.</p>

<p>Cincinnati (3-1)</p>
<p>at Baltimore (3-1)</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Ravens by 81/2</p>
<p>PICK: BENGALS Bengals tied for first but meet a team that is a little better in all phases. Ravens coming off a tough loss to the Pats and look forward to Brett Favre and the Vikes next week. RB Cedric Benson has been rejuvenated, while WR Chad Ochocinco needs to hang on to more balls. QB Joe Flacco becoming one of best passers in league, but Tabbies stay close.Oakland (1-3) at</p>
<p>N.Y. Giants (4-0)</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Giants by 151/2</p>
<p>PICK: GIANTSQB Eli Manning has a foot problem, so the ground game will prevail vs. overmatched Raiders. QB JaMarcus Russell would not be playing if he wasn't No. 1 overall mistake, but the Giants, with Saints and Cards on the horizon, will grind out this win. RB Brandon Jacobs will eat up clock. Dallas (2-2) at</p>
<p>Kansas City (0-4)</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Cowboys by 81/2</p>
<p>PICK: CHIEFSQuestions of QB Tony Romo's leadership are mounting after the loss to Denver. Chiefs have had a tough schedule but QB Matt Cassel is getting comfortable. Wade Phillips will use next week's bye to regroup, but this week his Boys will struggle.Washington (2-2)</p>
<p>at Carolina (0-3)</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Panthers by 31/2</p>
<p>PICK: PANTHERSQB Jake Delhomme had the bye week to take stock, but his career may be in the balance. If RBs DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart can get it going on the ground, WR Steve Smith will be freed up to contribute. Redskins averaging just 14 points per game under QB Jason Campbell. Not good.Minnesota (4-0)</p>
<p>at St. Louis (0-4)</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Vikings by 91/2</p>
<p>PICK: RAMSQB Brett Favre is only human and can't help but have a letdown against the pitiful Rams. Vikes RB Adrian Peterson was stuffed by the Packers, but needs to become focus of the offence again. If RB Steven Jackson can dent the Vikes' fine run defence, the Rams can stay in this game.Tampa Bay (0-4)</p>
<p>at Philadelphia (2-1)</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Eagles by 141/2</p>
<p>PICK: EAGLESQB Donovan McNabb and RB Brian Westbrook are back. Bucs are on their way to being the worst team in the league. Look for Michael Vick to score his first TD for Eagles, who are averaging 31 points per game. Bucs with QB Josh Johnson can't keep up. Pittsburgh (2-2)</p>
<p>at Detroit (1-3)</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Steelers by 101/2</p>
<p>PICK: STEELERSSteelers are elite team, even without DB Troy Polamalu. Lions are not, even with QB Matt Stafford. RB Rashard Mendenhall shredded the Bolts last week and QB Ben Roethlisberger has other weapons. A lot of points to be giving on the road, but it is the Lions. Cleveland (0-4)</p>
<p>at Buffalo (1-3)</p>
<p>1 p.m., CTV, CBS</p>
<p>LINE: Bills by 6</p>
<p>PICK: BROWNSThe Browns shipped controversial WR Braylon Edwards to the Jets. The Bills still have their own version in Terrell Owens. Cleveland may have a successful connection in QB Derek Anderson to WR Mohamed Massaquoi. Browns, losers last week in OT, stay close, maybe break 10-game losing streak vs. injury-riddled Bills D and O-line.Atlanta (2-1) at</p>
<p>San Francisco (3-1)</p>
<p>4 p.m., Fox</p>
<p>LINE: 49ers by 21/2</p>
<p>PICK: FALCONSThe Niners are without their offensive engine, injured RB Frank Gore, meaning rookie Glen Coffee is expected to supply the caffeine. Atlanta has not looked as dangerous as it did last season - neither RB Michael Turner nor WR Roddy White has shone.</p>
<p>Time for Falcons to get going. Houston (2-2)</p>
<p>at Arizona (1-2)</p>
<p>4: 15 p.m.</p>
<p>LINE: Cardinals by 51/2</p>
<p>PICK: CARDINALSTexans tight end Anthony Hill has had the NFL's first confirmed case of H1N1. What ails the Cards' formerly awesome offence, meanwhile, is a bit of a mystery. Coming off bye week, watch for QB Kurt Warner (four TDs, four INTs) to step it up. It would help if Arizona could get its running game going vs. susceptible Houston defence. New England (3-1)</p>
<p>at Denver (4-0)</p>
<p>4: 15 p.m., City, CBS</p>
<p>LINE: Patriots by 3</p>
<p>PICK: PATRIOTSDenver's "D" has allowed only 26 points through its first four games, but now faces task of thwarting Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, who mentored Broncos new head coach Josh McDaniels during his time in New England. Broncos are league's nicest surprise, but Patriots are one of its surest things. Jacksonville (2-2)</p>
<p>at Seattle (1-3)</p>
<p>4: 15 p.m., RSO</p>
<p>LINE: Seahawks by 1</p>
<p>PICK: JAGUARSSeahawks hope QB Matt Hasselbeck will be able to overcame pain in his back and start vs. Jags, who are becoming a pain in the butt for opponents, led by good play of QB David Garrard. Jags have a dangerous new weapon in WR Mike Sims-Walker.Indianapolis (4-0)</p>
<p>at Tennessee (0-4)</p>
<p>8: 20 p.m., TSN, NBC</p>
<p>LINE: Colts by 31/2</p>
<p>PICK: COLTSLet's see: Indy QB Peyton Manning has started the season with four successive 300-yard-plus passing performances. Titans defence, meanwhile, has allowed 300-yards-plus passing in three of its four games. Anybody see a pattern here? Plus, the Titans have committed 11 turnovers. N.Y. Jets (3-1)</p>
<p>at Miami (1-3)</p>
<p>8: 30 p.m., TSN</p>
<p>LINE: Jets by 11/2</p>
<p>PICK: JETSJets have advantage at quarterback, Mark Sanchez over Chad Henne. The latter beat Buffalo in his debut last week, with a whole lot of help from the running game, but Jets' defence will be a much tougher test. Jets have won three straight in Miami. RECORD: Last week 6-8; season 32-30</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Getting ready for the (flu) season; From Leafs and Raptors to high school leagues, Toronto-area teams are making contingency plans to deal with the H1N1 virus</b>
</div><div>Chris Young   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1074 words</div><div>9 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Don't shake hands. No chest bumps, props or shared water bottles. If you're feeling under the weather, don't come to the game. And if you're really under the weather, there will be no game at all.</p>
<p>So has gone the global reaction to the H1N1 virus pandemic. As the flu season takes hold here at home, Toronto's sports teams and schools are readying themselves - or not.</p>
<p>"Travelling in close quarters like we do all the time it would devastate a team if it ever hit us," Raptors head coach Jay Triano told The Star's Doug Smith. "We're being very careful with the cleanliness and trying to clean up our locker room and everything around it."</p>
<p>A scan of pro dressing rooms and school sports officials on Thursday revealed differing approaches but a consistent fine line being walked between the usual and the unusual, prevention and panic, reaction and overreaction. Hand sanitizers, for example, are standard operating equipment in all cases, and have been for some time. Sharing water bottles is okay in some places, but not in others.</p>
<p>The Raptors' Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment parent company has yet to come up with a policy or guidelines regarding prevention. On the league level, the NHL itself is in something of a waiting mode.</p>
<p>"We've focused on it and met internally to discuss the matter, but at this time have no firm 'cancellation' or other contingency plan in place," deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in an email, adding the league will "step up our preparation efforts if and when it becomes necessary."</p>
<p>School boards say they will follow directives from the Toronto Public Health department if H1N1 becomes a problem, but school sports associations have no plans in place in the event of game cancellations or playoffs, including those leading to provincial playoffs, the Star's David Grossman reports.</p>
<p>"If there are closures of schools, games could be compromised and we will deal with it if it becomes an issue," said Chick Kennedy, Athletics Administrator for the Toronto District School Board. "But there are no recommendations in place now on how to deal with any disruption of sports."</p>
<p>Kennedy said Canada's largest school board continues to advise students to shake hands after games, but avoid sharing water bottles.</p>
<p>Argos head athletic therapist Erin Brooks told the Star's Chris Zelkovich the team isn't treating this flu season any differently than in past years. "The flu season is the flu season, whether its H1N1 or another strain, and you have to take the same precautions," she said.</p>
<p>Brooks notes one difference this year, though.</p>
<p>"It's funny, you'll hear the guys saying, 'Hey, cough into your sleeve.' So they're obviously getting the message from the media and through us," said Brooks.</p>
<p>At Toronto FC, Dan Girard reports, no added precautions are being taken for H1N1, according to team officials. Hand sanitizers have long been in use and players are told to stay home from practice if they have flu-like symptoms. Like the Argos, players continue to share water bottles.</p>
<p>In the Maple Leafs' dressing room, Jamal Mayers voiced some concern. "As teammates, we're all together all of the time, so you watch for things (flu symptoms)," Mayers told the Star's Mark Zwolinski. "When someone's sick, you stay away from them for sure. But the swine flu is another level.</p>
<p>The Leafs said in a statement that they're preparing just in case: "We expect to have on hand sufficient vaccine for our players and their families, as well as or our staff."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the world has already felt the effects and sports has not been spared, whether it's in the locker room or the stadium. Houston Texans tight end Anthony Hill became the NFL's first H1N1 case late last week, and Hill's teammate Brian Cushing stayed at home on Wednesday with flu-like symptoms. In response, the league instituted a policy to give teams roster relief in case the epidemic spreads to at least six confirmed cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>Canadian Olympic Committee officials have advised athletes to come up with some new greetings to fellow athletes at the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympics - instead of shaking hands or kissing cheeks, elbow taps or even just a simple nod. The Olympics are not only where the world comes to play, but "where viruses of the world come to meet," warned COC chief medical officer Dr. Bob McCormack.</p>
<p>A report from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta recommends more drastic measures, such as increasing social distances to combat the spread of the virus; ideally, six feet or so. Playing a contact sport - or sitting in an arena or stadium among thousands watching - makes that goal pretty much impossible, which leads to the worst-case scenario: Shutting down the games themselves. In Mexico earlier this year, hundreds of soccer games were played in empty stadiums to avoid the spreading of the disease. In France, rugby matches were called off.</p>
<p>Chris Markham, executive director of the Ontario Physical and Health Education Association, said his organization - which works with schools in fostering active healthy lifestyles - has no directives on what to do in the event of an H1N1 outbreak. It's the same situation at the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations, an organization that runs close to 50 championships each year.</p>
<p>"In the event of problems and issues, we know what to do - but none of them relate specifically to H1N1," said Steve Shantz, co-ordinator of athletics with the York region athletic association. "The school boards are prepared. As for sports, right now we don't need to add anything new or confuse things."</p>

<p>Re: Handwashing in doubt as weapon against flu (Oct. 2). I thought I had a good handle on the seasonal flu and the "coming" H1N1 pandemic. However, my world has been thrown into chaos as yet another expert throws a wrench into my long-held, cherished beliefs.</p>
<p>Dr. Mom always told, and still tells, me to cover your mouth when you cough, wash your hands when they are dirty, get a good night's sleep and to eat your veggies. Her sage advise has stood her four sons well.</p>

<p>As illnesses go, diabetes is a quiet one, provoking little of the fear inspired by the H1N1 virus now dominating headlines. But diabetes is epidemic and poised to get much worse. More than two million Canadians have the disease and it is estimated another five million -- 15 per cent of the country's population -- are "pre-diabetic." An increasing, and worrying, number of them are young adults and children.</p>
<p>By the end of September, 78 Canadians with H1N1, or swine flu, had died. Diabetes is linked to 40,000 deaths a year in Canada and thousands more people are maimed by the disease, overwhelming the meagre medical services in many remote communities. Doctors fear the disease will swamp the health-care system if unchecked.</p>

<p>Elections Canada is taking special steps to be able to run a nationwide general election in the middle of a serious outbreak of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The federal agency has already spent about $700,000 on basic measures such as providing hand-sanitizing liquid and improving training manuals.</p>
<p>Some of those special steps, aimed at protecting the health of Elections Canada workers and the health of voters, will be tested out in four byelections underway in B.C., Quebec, and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>"All of us are hoping H1N1 doesn't become as serious as some are suggesting it might,"said Conservative MP Tom Lukiwski. "However, governments, [Elections Canada] and others have to be prepared for the worst."</p>
<p>Chief electoral officer Marc Mayrand told MPs yesterday that his agency is trying, for example, to avoid using senior citizens' homes as polling places in areas where H1N1 is active. Bringing large numbers of strangers into a seniors residence raises the risk of transmission of the flu to the vulnerable group.</p>
<p>Mayrand made his comments at a meeting of the House of Commons standing committee on procedure and house affairs.</p>
<p>Some MPs were worried that the confusion and displacement that a serious H1N1 outbreak could cause on polling day could threaten the validity of some local elections.</p>
<p>"I take these concerns very seriously, as impacts may vary considerably across the country," said Mayrand. "My overall concern is to exercise due diligence by providing continuous service to electors."</p>
<p>Mayrand said he does not have legal authority to postpone election day even if it looks like only 20 per cent of the population in a given riding was healthy enough to vote.</p>
<p>"We could have an election and have only 30 or 40 per cent show up," said Conservative MP Guy Lauzon. In last fall's federal election, about 58 per cent of eligible electors actually voted.</p>

<p>No kid likes having a needle. Many will be upset to hear that they will need not only their seasonal flu shot, but an additional one for H1N1.</p>
<p>Do not lie to your child about getting an injection, pediatrician Lonnie Zeltzer of UCLA's <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> Children's Hospital says. No one likes having a needle, but if you reassure your child that there are ways to make the hurt go away, you can help them have a less painful experience.</p>
<p>There are several ways parents can ease the ordeal. The key, according to her, is to be creative and use the right combination of tactics depending on your child's age and fear level.</p>
<p>Tips to minimize the pain:</p>
<p>- With young children, bring soap bubbles and blow bubbles during the injection, suggesting they are "blowing away the hurt."</p>
<p>- With a crying infant, if the parent places the plastic bubble-maker in front of the child's mouth, as they cry out, they will make bubbles. Zeltzer has seen babies stop in mid-cry because they were distracted by the bubbles.</p>
<p>- Bubbles might not work with older children, but parents can help the child to breathe out slowly as if he/she were blowing up a big balloon.</p>
<p>- Ahead of time ask your doctor about a numbing cream for the specific areas to be injected.</p>
<p>- If your doctor approves, give your child a pain reliever, such as Tylenol, about one hour ahead. On returning home, put an ice bag on the injection site to reduce local swelling and pain.</p>

<div>678 words</div><div>9 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region's public health section has announced temporary service reductions and cancellations as it prepares to deliver mass immunizations against the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>But new parents and others affected by the changes will be able to find alternative ways of getting the services they need after the changes take effect in early November, deputy medical health officer Dr. Ross Findlater said Thursday.</p>
<p>"For breastfeeding support, for instance, there is a centre that's not run by public health nurses, it's run by primary health out of the West Winds (Primary Health Centre) facility.</p>
<p>"And there are a number of other similar situations like that, where there is an alternative to the public health-delivered service. It's just the public health-delivered service that's sort of cut back for a while."</p>
<p>First home visits to newborn babies will continue, because they are delivered by a separate section of the health region, for instance. Prenatal classes will also continue, since they are a primary health service.</p>
<p>Another example is the temporary closure of public health's sexually transmitted infection clinic, which offers testing and treatment during limited hours.</p>
<p>"There is (also) a clinic in our Idylwyld (Centre) facility that treats people with sexually transmitted infections -- and it's certainly not the only source of treatment for those infections in the city," Findlater said.</p>
<p>"Most of them, in fact, are treated by physicians in their office setting. So for the time period that we're having to cut back on those services, those clients will have to be going to physicians' offices."</p>
<p>The service reductions will likely last about four to six weeks, depending on the demand for mass immunizations, he said.</p>
<p>Anyone looking for more information about alternate arrangements for services is asked to call public health at 655-4620. The health region's website, www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca[http://www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca], also features a service guide and a parents' directory of alternative services in the Saskatoon area.</p>
<p>Public health inspections of restaurants and other "low-risk facilities" will be reduced in ways such as delaying re-inspections of places that have recently been inspected, "but I think it's fairly clear that anything that's complaint-driven will be seen right away," Findlater said.</p>

<p>The Saskatoon Health Region has released a detailed list of public health services that will be reduced, and in some cases cancelled, in order to free up staff for mass immunization clinics in response to the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Once the clinics begin, the following services will be reduced:</p>
<p>- Fluoride varnishing, except for vulnerable preschool children;</p>
<p>- Child health clinic appointments will be limited to immunization only, with no screening or referrals by public health nurses;</p>
<p>- Routine immunizations will be available only for children needing their 2-, 4-, 6- and 12-month shots;</p>
<p>- Early childhood psychology services will be reduced;</p>
<p>- Breastfeeding, infant and preschool nutrition support will be reduced;</p>
<p>- Permits, inspections and approval of plumbing installations and sewage disposal systems will be reduced;</p>
<p>- Approval and inspection of facilities covered by the Public Health Act that do not need licensing will be reduced;</p>
<p>- Education programs for restaurant and food services operators will be reduced;</p>
<p>- Health centres will not be open for weighing infants;</p>
<p>- Routine services of the International Travel Centre will be reduced, except services to clients who need vaccines for travel visas or who are travelling to destinations other than vacation resorts.</p>
<p>While the mass immunizations are underway, the following services will be discontinued:</p>
<p>- Public health breastfeeding support;</p>
<p>- Community follow-up for children discharged from hospital;</p>
<p>- Dental health promotion and education;</p>
<p>- Older adult health promotion and education;</p>
<p>- Parenting support groups;</p>
<p>- Postnatal home visits;</p>
<p>- Postnatal phone calls;</p>
<p>- Sexually transmitted infection clinic;</p>
<p>- Inspections of "low-risk" facilities that are not regulated under the Public Health Act and that are under the jurisdiction of other federal, provincial and municipal agencies;</p>
<p>- Routine immunizations of adults and children who are 18 months old, four years old, or school age;</p>
<p>- Rural speech language pathology services.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The Liberals' body-bag farce</b>
</div><div>National Post</div>
<div>773 words</div><div>9 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The great body-bag "controversy" of 2009 has degenerated into farce. When shipments of pandemic-preparedness supplies were sent to remote aboriginal communities in northern Manitoba last month, locals were stunned to discover that in some cases, they included large quantities of body bags. An outcry ensued. Critics accused the federal Ministry of Health of insensitivity (even though safe storage of human remains is a legitimate, even important part of infectious-disease preparation, particularly in permafrost areas -- but more on that below).</p>
<p>Indian leaders yelped about how insensitive Health Canada had been: In their culture, they said, preparing for death means inviting its presence. They asked if the government would send body bags to soldiers fighting in Afghanistan (to which the answer would have been, of course, "How exactly do you think they get there?")</p>
<p>Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, who we're told is a Harvard man, wholly endorsed the atmosphere of superstitious irritability, saying that the shipments "[send] a message that simply says we expect aboriginal Canadians to die ... it sends a message of callous lack of compassion." He insisted that the minister could not possibly blame anyone else for the faux pas: "This is a matter of direct ministerial responsibility."</p>
<p>Lo and behold, the National Post discovered this week that the only large delivery of body bags that Health Canada confirms actually got through, a 100-unit supply sent to the Wasagamack First Nation, was requested by the nurse in charge of the medical station on the reserve. The Health Canada bureaucrats -- the ones that Minister Leona Aglukkaq was so quick to apologize for -- take the view, rightly, that it is the first responders on the scene in remote areas who have the best idea of what their material needs will be in readying for epidemic disease. The nurse in Wasagamack, given general instructions to "order big," asked for an unusually large number, aware that aerial reshipments would be more difficult after winter set in.</p>
<p>Yet even after these facts were made public, the Liberals continued to bang on about the issue: As late as Thursday afternoon -- after the non-scandal had been debunked -- the Liberal caucus issued a press release that "called on the Harper government to speed up the availability of vaccines for Canadians vulnerable to H1N1, and demanded [Health] Minister Aglukkaq publicly apologize for sending body bags to Aboriginal reserves."</p>
<p>Let's all try to remember, without hyperventilating, that body bags are goods that are easy to store in a small space and have a long shelf life -- and are pretty much guaranteed to be used eventually, by all of us. And let's remember that, yes, they are life-saving equipment that prevents secondary infections. Soldiers -- or firefighters, or EMTs, or the Red Cross -- will be the first to explain the unhappy truth to you, in an adult manner, that when you need one, you really need one.</p>
<p>It is simply incredible that this ever became an issue. Firstnations representatives, in general, acted during the "scandal" as though the body bags were a gruesome, cynical alternative to the magical cure for swine flu they were expecting. You know, the one that's being handed out to the white people secretly.</p>
<p>We are all facing the advent of the H1N1 virus, and some of us are going to die from it when it pervades the population fully. The same Manitoba villages that were the focus of complaint, because a need for handling deaths was recognized, were all but wiped out by the Spanish flu of 1919; their residents lack the immunological resistance of city dwellers, enjoy somewhat worse general and respiratory health, live in crowded housing units, and may even be extra vulnerable for genetic reasons. It is a shame that more has not been done since 1919 to change the elements of this vulnerability that can be changed by human enterprise. And it is true that the public health apparatus of the federal government has, at times, seemed not to be aware that this was a special problem. But the body bags didn't, and don't, need to be apologized for.</p>
<p>In fact, this whole episode, coming as it does on the heels of the equally trumped up Suaad Hagi Mohamud affair, marks a good opportunity for Parliamentarians to re-examine the knee-jerk reflex that has taken hold of us, requiring an apology to shoot from the lips of any politician accused of insensitivity, however baselessly, by identity politicians and their Ottawa enablers (take a bow, Mr. Harvard). What was once merely tiresome, is now outright ridiculous.</p>

</p>
<p>No "ill will" was intended when Health Canada shipped a "disproportionately high" number of body bags to remote First Nations reserves in Manitoba, Canada's federal health minister said yesterday.</p>
<p>"It was a clear overestimation and there was no evidence of ill will or deliberate calculation," Leona Aglukkaq told reporters during a weekly H1N1 news briefing.</p>
<p>Four reserves said they received body bags in shipments from Health Canada last month. The shipments also included hand sanitizer and face masks.</p>
<p>The incident exacerbated already tense relations between aboriginal communities and Health Canada over pandemic preparedness. Several northern Manitoba reserves were hit hard in the first wave of the pandemic in the spring and have repeatedly expressed concerns throughout the summer that they need more help to prepare for the second wave. Federal health officials, however, say nursing stations on reserves have the proper materials they need, including access to antiviral medications.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said Health Canada provides small quantities of body bags to nursing stations on First Nations reserves as part of their medical supplies.</p>
<p>But she said an investigation by Health Canada's deputy minister found an order for body bags for the Wasagamack First Nation was "disproportionately high" compared with other reserves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as health officials in the U.S. prepare to release tens of millions of doses of human swine-flu vaccine, Canadian health officials are teaching Canadians how to wash their hands.</p>
<p>The contrast is raising renewed questions about whether the vaccine will be made available in time to protect Canadians from a second wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer said yesterday that 35 per cent or more of the country could become sick with H1N1. But the largest vaccination program in the nation's history is not scheduled to begin before the first week of November, when the first doses of vaccine will go to those at highest risk of serious illness, including adults under 65 with chronic health conditions and health-care workers involved in pandemic response.</p>
<p>A flu vaccine became available in the U.S. in a nasal spray form this week. Next week, it becomes available in the injectable form. At Canada's weekly swine-flu briefing yesterday, the focus was on hand-washing, and new federal guidance on proper hand hygiene.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>But First Nations still not prepared for H1N1: top chief -</b>
</div><div>By Aldo Santin </div>

</p>
<p>A federal review has found there was no ill will behind Ottawa's decision to send a large number of body bags to a northern reserve, but the head of Manitoba First Nations insists those communities remain ill-prepared for the looming pandemic.</p>
<p>"The pandemic plan is ready but there are no resources to implement the plan," Grand Chief Ron Evans said during a news conference Wednesday at the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs downtown Winnipeg offices.</p>
<p>Evans said he believes federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq honestly feels Ottawa has adequately prepared First Nations communities for an expected outbreak of H1N1, but added he believes she's being misled by her regional officials.</p>
<p>Evans said the AMC sent 5,000 flu kits to 20 northern fly-in bands and another 10,200 kits will be trucked out next week. Evans said the kits contain basic materials Ottawa has failed to provide to First Nation communities.</p>
<p>"What's important to us is there is action behind words," Evans said. "We don't want to make this political. We want our communities to get ready for the pandemic."</p>
<p>Manitoba's First Nations were the hardest-hit by the outbreak of H1N1 flu last spring. The AMC says it is taking a proactive stance on community care for the fall.</p>
<p>The flu kits, paid for by the province and private donations, are designed to help a family cope with an H1N1 outbreak. They include hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, Tylenol for infants, children and adults and a flexible digital thermometer. There is also information on caring for a child with a fever and self-care for flu patients.</p>
<p>"Typically, a shipment of this magnitude would take months to accomplish," Evans said. "We've made it happen in weeks."</p>
<p>AMC officials say the kits and medical information may ease the demand on health-care facilities that were overwhelmed when H1N1 broke out in First Nations communities earlier this year.</p>
<p>"(The kits) are meant to be a starter kit for the flu season... meant to be the first line of defence for homes," said Glen Sanderson, the AMC's pandemic policy analyst.</p>
<p>"We have very little access to health care, to medical supplies, not like we have here in the city of Winnipeg. I can run down 24/7 to any pharmacy and buy what I need, but not on a First Nation, there is no such thing. The nursing stations do supply things like that... but there's no need to do that if you have things like these at home as a starter kit."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said earlier in the day an internal probe into why dozens of body bags were sent to Wasagamack uncovered no malice.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq released a report on the investigation she ordered last month into the body-bag shipments after chiefs from the Island Lake region in Manitoba said their nursing stations had been sent dozens of body bags amid other supplies to battle H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>According to the report, the body bags were part of orders made by nurses in charge at the northern nursing stations who had been ordered by the regional office to order enough drugs and medical supplies to fight H1N1 to last three to four months. They were told to "order big" and err on the side of ordering too much.</p>
<p>A nurse in Wasagamack ordered 100 body bags. Nurses in four other reserves also ordered body bags. Only 38 of the 100 Wasagamack order were ever delivered because of a back order. No other reserves received any body bags.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said ordering 100 was "a clear overestimation" but that it was not done with malice.</p>
<p>"There was no evidence of ill will," she said.</p>
<p>Evans said the body-bag incident shows the deep-rooted lack of understanding by federal officials and their employees who deal with First Nation communities.</p>
<p>"It all boils down to not enough communication," Evans said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other Manitoba chiefs said Wednesday they are dissatisfied with the report the federal health minister released.</p>
<p>"The minister's findings regarding the body bags needs to be carefully analyzed; to me it's a coverup," said Chief Oliver Okemow of Manto Sipi Cree Nation.</p>
<p>Added Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak Grand Chief David Harper: "We will not accept anything less than an apology from the minister and for her to act on this apology by properly funding our First Nations' pandemic preparedness and response needs."</p>

</div><div>Lowell Ullrich </div>
<div>The Province</div>

</p>
<p>A recent precautionary warning from the country's leading sports medical officer about the H1N1 virus isn't going to be ignored by the Lions.</p>
<p>Of course, Dr. Bob McCormack not only is the chief medical officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee but also the lead physican of the CFL club.</p>
<p>McCormack last week cautioned against excessive celebrations at the upcoming Winter Olympics to curb the potential spread of the virus and the Lions, though they don't have to worry about many group hugs, are also being extra cautious.</p>
<p>Three players -- Jerome Dennis, Nautyn McKay-Loescher and Mike McEachern --were told to stay home from practice this week as a precaution. There was also talk of a mononucleosis virus around the club as well.</p>
<p>"We were kind of hoping unlike the hockey teams that the H1N1 will be worst in January when we're done," said Lions trainer Bill Reichelt. "But basically we're following the same steps as the public right now."</p>
<p>To stop a virus from spreading around a locker-room inhabited by 50 large males, the club has put out added liquid soap dispensers around Camp Surrey. Most players observed at practice Wednesday shared water bottles, though all made a point of only making hand contact.</p>
<p>But the suggestion made by McCormack that handshakes should be replaced by knuckle taps and arm shots as a means of celebration seems to be taking hold.</p>
<p>"I'm seeing that way more now," said Reichelt.</p>
<p>However, three straight upcoming road trips have become more than just a concern for the Lions' playoff future. Reichelt said the club will do what it can to combat the reduced internal resistance which comes from added airplane travel, including inoculations if necessary. It's why there's as much oregano oil as pain-killers in the medical room these days.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Farmers says 'swine flu' has role in tough times; Situation's made worse by misnomer</b>

</p>
<p>Those who say names will never hurt you should spend time on a Fraser Valley hog farm where over 90 per cent of this province's pork is produced.</p>
<p>No matter which farm is picked, it won't be a pretty place because all farmers in this small B.C. agricultural sector are struggling to bring home the bacon for their families.</p>
<p>Over-supplied markets, high feed costs and a very strong Canadian dollar for the past three years have clobbered B.C. and other Canadian hog producers.</p>
<p>But now a name -- or rather a misnomer -- is making a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>Use of the term "swine flu" when referring to the H1N1 Influenza A virus is costing domestic hog producers dearly, says Jack DeWitt, chairman of the Abbotsford-based B.C. Pork Producers Association.</p>
<p>"We'd already become a much smaller industry in B.C. that has gone through extremely difficult times over the past few years," he says. "And this was supposed to be the year we started a recovery." However, when news of the new influenza pandemic spread in earnest earlier this year, so did the term "swine flu" -- even though there is no danger of catching this flu from pork consumption.</p>
<p>I'm told the only link between hogs and H1N1 is that the virus is related to a family of flu viruses that were found on North American hog farms in the 1990s.</p>
<p>In fact, as Dr. Josh Waddington, a veterinarian who teaches at the University of the Fraser Valley, recently told the Chilliwack Times, an infected human is more likely to give a pig this flu than vice versa.</p>
<p>"All of this is totally unfair because H1N1 is a human health issue, not an animal health issue," says DeWitt. "It's not a food safety issue either.</p>
<p>"Regardless, some consumers keep the swine-flu term in mind when looking at the pork shelf in their supermarkets.</p>
<p>"We had hoped the term's use would have faded by now but it hasn't," he adds. "Even the CBC, for example, continues to use the terminology in its broadcasts." But now it's time for domestic pork producers to put a stop to being "pig in the middle" on this issue, says DeWitt, who owns and operates a large hog farm in the Fort Langley area.</p>
<p>Unlike the poultry or dairy sectors, there are no government-run marketing boards, price or production controls in the pork industry.</p>
<p>It's wide open, and as prices fall and the Canadian dollar rises, U.S. producers are moving in, he warns. They already have about 25 per cent of the B.C. market and that share is growing.</p>
<p>"So we have to do a better job promoting ourselves with consumers and find ways to add more value to pork beyond just selling hogs on the hoof," DeWitt explains.</p>
<p>The federal and B.C. governments are stepping in with several programs designed to help local hog producers adjust.</p>
<p>But DeWitt is convinced that his industry must also help itself to become more competitive.</p>
<p>Maintaining the status quo only means current market forces will continue to huff and puff until they blow the Valley's pork industry down.</p>

</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's prenatal classes are temporarily cancelled, but expectant parents can expect the welcome mat to be out at the YMCA's childbirth preparation classes.</p>
<p>Beginning Tuesday, the health region will discontinue prenatal classes so the public health nurses who run them can be redeployed to immunize for the pandemic H1N1 influenza. The prenatal classes will resume once the mass immunizations are complete.</p>
<p>Sally Elliott, the YMCA's childbirth instructor, has no way to predict how many new arrivals might sign up for her prenatal classes, but she's willing to accommodate one and all.</p>
<p>"We'll make it work for families," she said. "I'm quite prepared to work with a large group. I'm also prepared to organize other classes if I need to do that for the next three months. If there's a huge, huge group and my room cannot accommodate them, I'll do crash weekend courses."</p>
<p>Currently, Elliott teaches four prenatal classes a week with approximately 25 couples in each class.</p>
<p>"We're busy," she said. "I'm very used to working with big, big groups. When we had that huge influx of pregnant women about a year ago, I had one class that had 60-some couples in it, so we're quite prepared to stuff them in."</p>
<p>While public health prenatal classes are offered free of charge, the YMCA charges members $43.23 to attend the childbirth classes and non-members $86.52.</p>
<p>"We've never turned anybody away because of an inability to pay," Elliott noted.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, she's been preparing people for their life-long role as parents. Classes for first-time parents are held over 10 weeks and the refresher course lasts five weeks.</p>
<p>Among the human dynamo's other duties are holding a postpartum support group and leading the Y's Moms group.</p>
<p>"The Y's Moms are mothers with babies, usually under a year, who come together each week to ask questions, brainstorm, share experiences -- we have a wonderful time," Elliott said. "This is what is so wonderful about being able to work here.</p>
<p>"Conceivably, I can see a woman when sperm meets egg and she comes to the prenatal aquafit (class). I get to know her very well and then she comes to the prenatal classes, then has her baby.</p>
<p>"If I'm lucky, I get to see her in the hospital and then they come to Y's Moms. It's just so wonderful to be able to offer this continuum."</p>

</p>
<p>A confidential, month-old H1N1 report prepared for the B.C. Health Services Ministry and leaked to the public, indicates the province is not prepared for a possible outbreak this fall.</p>
<p>“... The impact of even a mild presentation of the H1N1 virus on British Columbia may create a surge that could challenge the ability of critical care units to meet demand and care for patients,” the report stated.</p>
<p>A 1968 pandemic that hit the province was analyzed in preparation of the report. Australia and New Zealand's 2009 flu season reports were also investigated.</p>
<p>After being briefed on the report last month, B.C. Health Minister Kevin Falcon ordered 25 more ventilators for the province, meaning that flu fighters will have access to about 100 more ventilators than they do now, should an epidemic occur.</p>
<p>B.C.'s Opposition Critic for Health, New Democrat Adrian Dix, said that 25 more is not enough.</p>
<p>“What the report shows in a fairly clear way is that the governments chosen the wrong time to be engaging in cuts in acute care and cuts in services in health care in British Columbia,” Mr. Dix said.</p>
<p>Mr. Falcon said the federal government could provide additional assistance if it is required.</p>
<p>B.C.'s medical health officer didn't even see the report until it was leaked, Mr. Dix noted, questioning why the government kept the report a secret.</p>
<p>Mr. Falcon said the document was just a draft and was incomplete. However Mr. Dix disputed that explanation.</p>
<p>“All government reports are now marked as drafts so that they are exempt from provincial Freedom of Information laws,” said Mr. Dix, who also serves as the Opposition Caucus Deputy House Leader.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Blame the body bags on an order to go big. That's the finding of a Health Canada probe into why dozens of body bags were sent to a Manitoba reserve recently in what some took as a grim prognosis for the coming flu season.</p>
<p>The investigation found no sign of "ill will" -- just bad math.</p>
<p>The five-page report says the Wasagamack First Nation's body-bag order was "disproportionately high in comparison to quantities in nursing stations across the country."</p>
<p>But that's because nurses were advised to "order generously and fill supply rooms" ahead of a possible second wave of swine flu this fall.</p>
<p>Senior officials told nurses in remote communities to order enough supplies to last three or four months instead of the usual six weeks. "The repeated message given to nurses from senior levels down was to 'order big,"' the report says.</p>
<p>And apparently that's what the head nurse for the Wasagamack First Nation did.</p>
<p>The report found the nurse ordered 100 body bags in August for the tiny northern community of 1,750 people. Only 38 bags were actually delivered. But that was still more than other nursing stations on reserves, which typically stock 10 bags or less.</p>

<p>- Dear Lord, please give Alberta another Peter Lougheed. - Premier Stelmach should be worried about getting people to vote for him in the next election.

</p>
<p>A young adult in the Interior is the seventh person in B.C. to die after contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>In the past week, there have also been 11 new severe cases of the virus, bringing the total to 64 since April.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control is no longer tracking all new cases of the H1N1 virus, instead reporting only severe cases, which it defines as those that require hospitalization or end in death.</p>
<p>The most recent death associated with H1N1 occurred Tuesday at a hospital within the Interior Health Authority. Public health officials there would not release the age or gender of the patient, but they did say the person had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>All seven of the H1N1-related deaths in B.C. have involved underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Danuta Skowronski, physician epidemiologist with the disease control centre, said there has been an upswing in H1N1 activity in recent weeks and she anticipates there will be a further increase in the number of severe cases and deaths.</p>
<p>"All indicators point to a dramatic upswing," she said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"So we should certainly anticipate that there will be more of those severe outcomes occurring."</p>
<p>People with medical conditions such as respiratory illnesses, diabetes and heart disease -- and women who are pregnant --should speak to their doctor about getting a prescription for an antiviral, which needs to be taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms to be effective, Skowronski said.</p>

<p>The city's biggest transit union is objecting to an OC Transpo policy that forbids drivers and maintenance workers to take planned days off until the transit company's unauthorized absenteeism improves.</p>
<p>Transit general manager Alain Mercier has said the city's applying the policy as a collective punishment to combat exceptionally high sick-day claims among the rank and file.</p>
<p>Union president André Cornellier says the no-leave policy is at odds with advice from the city's public-health department, urging people to stay home if they're sick, lest they spread H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>"Many of our passengers are taking the bus in order to get to or from their doctor's office, urgent care clinics or even the hospital. When you combine being exposed like this with the stressful conditions at OC Transpo, it's no surprise that our operators and maintenance staff get sick more often than office workers do," Cornellier said in a written statement.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa takes meat-label fight to World Trade Organization; Canada says U. S. rules hurt ability to compete</b>
</div><div>Paul Vieira   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>488 words</div><div>8 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>

<p>C anada on Wednesday fired its latest shot to push the United States to repeal a controversial meat-labelling law by formally asking the World Trade Organization to issue its own judgment on whether the legislation passes muster.</p>
<p>The federal government said the formal request was necessary after months of WTO-supervised negotiations between the two countries failed to produce a resolution. The WTO will now hold a quasi-judicial hearing to determine the outcome, and it normally takes up to nine months for a judgment to be issued.</p>
<p>The trade dispute concerns a meat-labelling law, known as COOL, or country-of-origin labelling, that requires meat and other foods sold at U. S. supermarkets to have labels that indicate from which countries the food originates. On top of that, the Obama administration has asked the U. S. meat-packing industry to undertake additional "voluntary" measures that are not in the law, including that labels be included on processed meats.</p>
<p>"The U. S. COOL requirements are so onerous that they affect the ability of our cattle and hog exporters to compete fairly in the U. S. market," International Trade Minister Stockwell Day said in a statement. "That is why our government has no choice but to request a WTO panel. This request demonstrates our ongoing commitment to resolving this issue and defending the interests of Canadian producers."</p>
<p>The move comes amid recent programs unveiled by the federal government, totalling nearly $100 million, to help hog farmers either temporarily exit the industry or seek new markets for their livestock. These measures are meant to mitigate the fallout from export losses, due to trade restrictions such as the labelling law or bans sparked by the initial outbreak of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Previously, Canadian officials believed they had a resolution over COOL with the former Bush administration, but that changed after the Democrats took control of the White House.</p>
<p>Trade lawyers have said Canada's case is solid, as the labelling requirements put Canadian products at a disadvantage, which is not allowed under global trade rules.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Ron Kirk, the U. S. trade representative, and Tom Vilsack, the U. S. agriculture secretary, said they believe the U. S. labelling rule obeys all the conditions set out by the WTO.</p>
<p>"Countries have agreed since long before the existence of the WTO that country-of-origin labelling is a legitimate policy," they said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council endorsed Ottawa's WTO request, arguing the U. S. legislation has caused U. S. pork processors to cease buying Canadian-raised livestock.</p>
<p>"(It) is a welcome signal that our government understands the impact COOL is having on our producers," said Jurgen Preugschas, council president and a hog farmer in Mayerthorpe, Alta.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Are businesses ready for H1N1?</b>
</div><div>John Larsen And Bob Klay   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>744 words</div><div>8 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Before you say you've already heard all you want to hear about the impending second wave of the H1N1 flu, please hear this. Much of the thinking about how to respond to this threat --a serious reality that is becoming clearer as the second wave shifts from Australia, through South America, and eventually to Canada--is misguided.</p>
<p>Most companies are either ill-prepared for the next wave because they weren't affected by the first wave that broke in the spring, or the companies that hope to be ready are relying on an amended application of their standard emergency response plan; a plan that won't work in the face of H1N1. The off-the-shelf emergency response plan or business continuity plan simply does not have enough detail to handle the realities that'll be presented by the next H1N1 ordeal.</p>
<p>H1N1 readiness isn't really about good emergency preparedness. It's not just another hazard.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because corporate emergency planning is based on the assumption that we'll be facing a critical incident that forces us to take steps to "resume" our regular business operations. It's about how we can best adjust internal processes to "get back" to what we normally do. Implicit in this business resumption mentality is the assumption that we'll be able to leverage additional human resources.</p>
<p>But, when H1N1 returns --next month or the next --your company won't have all those people identified in the carefully designed emergency response plan. Some experts put employee absenteeism as high as 38 per cent. In the military, they call it the centre of gravity; the one key element that, if it goes wrong, will foil your plan for success. The centre of gravity for effective emergency planning is human resources and H1N1 will hinder that.</p>
<p>So, preparing for the second wave of the flu isn't so much about business resumption as it is about business continuity. You don't have to fix anything that went wrong; you just have to keep doing what you normally do well.</p>
<p>It's about using flexible procedures to maintain your company's regular operations when faced with limited staff. That means taking the time to build an integrated business continuity plan that focuses on the three key elements of human resources, facilities/ technologies and communications.</p>
<p>These are the three most important support services for your company during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, you have to prepare to have trained and authorized staff to fill these critical positions in the very real event of high absenteeism. Your plan also has to effectively communicate your contingency policies about employee sickness, and be able to inform employees about what actions they should take if they fall ill.</p>
<p>People need to believe that their workplace is clean and safe, and that if they are unable to come to work --or are even uncomfortable being near others --you will provide them with the technological ability to work from home.</p>
<p>A solid business continuity plan builds communications linkages to employees and customers which help manage the effects of the flu. Good communications will let employees and business stakeholders know how your human resources will be managed, what alternate work arrangements have been adopted, and how business will continue, albeit in a modified form. Messages should address risks realistically, communicate with compassion and provide clarity in laying out the various operating options.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin said that it isn't the most intelligent species that survives, or even the strongest, it's those that are most adaptive to change. An organization can have an exceptionally well conceptualized designed crisis or emergency management plan, and it can have strong and secure internal systems, but neither of these will mean much if it hasn't deliberately thought through how it will sustain everyday operations when its employee base is drastically diminished.</p>
<p>How will your organization adapt to the changes you'll need to face when the second wave of H1N1 hits? Common sense and thoughtful planning will get us through this next pandemic event, and beyond.</p>

<p>No "ill will" was intended when Health Canada shipped a "disproportionately high" number of body bags to remote First Nations reserves in Manitoba, Canada's health minister said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It was a clear overestimation and there was no evidence of ill will or deliberate calculation," Leona Aglukkaq told reporters during a weekly H1N1 news briefing.</p>
<p>Four reserves said they received body bags in shipments from Health Canada last month that included hand sanitizer and face masks.</p>
<p>The incident exacerbated already tense relations between aboriginal communities and Health Canada over pandemic preparedness. Several northern Manitoba reserves were hit hard in the first wave of the pandemic in the spring and repeatedly expressed concerns this summer that they need more help to prepare for the second wave. Federal health officials, however, say nursing stations on reserves have what they need, including access to antiviral medications.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said Health Canada provides small quantities of body bags to First Nations nursing stations as part of their medical supplies.</p>
<p>But she said an investigation by Health Canada's deputy minister found an order for body bags for the Wasagamack First Nation was "disproportionately high" compared with other reserves.</p>
<p>According to a Health Canada probe into the incident, senior management told nursing stations to make sure they were well-stocked and to "order big,"</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said Health Canada will introduce stricter controls governing the procurement process for body bags.</p>

</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- After months of fruitless talks with the Obama administration, Canada wants the World Trade Organization to settle a dispute over a new U.S. food-labelling law that threatens tens of millions of dollars worth of Canadian hog and cattle exports.</p>
<p>Trade Minister Stockwell Day said yesterday that he has asked a WTO dispute settlement panel to determine whether U.S. country-of-origin labelling rules impose “unfair and unnecessary” costs on Canadian farmers.</p>
<p>“The U.S. [country-of-origin labelling] requirements are so onerous that they affect the ability of our cattle and hog exporters to compete fairly in the U.S. market,” Mr. Day said.</p>
<p>The U.S. law, he said, leaves the Canadian government with “no choice” but to escalate its first formal trade dispute with the Obama administration.</p>
<p>The list of Canadian trade grievances has since grown to include “Buy American” government purchasing rules and generous U.S. biofuel tax breaks for paper producers. The two countries are also sparring off and on about softwood lumber, with the U.S. recently winning a key ruling that Canada was skirting a 2006 agreement limiting shipments to the United States.</p>
<p>Exporters warn that such rules are conspiring to make the Canada-U.S. border thicker, undermining long-standing ties within integrated industries.</p>
<p>As for the labelling rules, U.S. officials counter that country-of-origin regulations are common around the world.</p>
<p>“Countries have agreed since long before the existence of the WTO that country-of-origin labelling is a legitimate policy,” U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a joint statement yesterday.</p>
<p>The U.S. labelling law requires American companies to track and notify customers as to the country of origin of meat and other agricultural products at each major stage of production, including at the retail level.</p>
<p>The United States made some changes to its rules to alleviate Canadian concerns. But Ottawa said the rules are still causing confusion and uncertainty, prompting major U.S. processors to shun Canadian imports.</p>
<p>Ottawa initiated formal consultations with the United States in May, and Mr. Day had said in July that he was confident the issue could be settled without turning to the WTO. Once a WTO dispute resolution panel is set up, a ruling typically takes nine months. But appeals could keep the case going for years.</p>
<p>The labelling law has already prompted several major U.S. pork producers, including <span class="companylink">Cargill Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">JBS SA</span>, <span class="companylink">Hormel Foods Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Seaboard Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods Inc</span>. to stop buying Canadian hogs or gradually phase out purchases. The five companies account for more than half of all pork sold in the United States.</p>
<p>Exports of hogs to the United States, for example, have tumbled roughly 60 per cent so far this year.</p>
<p>Young animals are often shipped to the U.S. for fattening and slaughter. But segregating the Canadian animals from domestic ones is costly and inefficient.</p>
<p>The U.S. law allows producers a range of labelling options, including stamping labels on the meat from these cross-border animals as “product of the United States and Canada.”</p>
<p>In addition to livestock imports, the labelling law could also affect a broad range of Canadian processed meat exports, including bacon and sliced sandwich meats.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost the food industry $2.5-billion (U.S.) to comply with the new rules.</p>
<p>U.S. processors are simply choosing not to buy in Canada, rather than dealing with the cost and complexity of the rules, according to Canadian pork producers. Instead they're buying from U.S. farmers.</p>
<p>Roughly 7 per cent of the pork consumed in the U.S. comes from Canada, keeping several U.S. processing plants in business.</p>
<p>While opposed by most U.S. processors, the labelling law enjoys strong support among farmers, consumer groups and several influential members of Congress, who argue that Americans have a right to know where their food comes from.</p>
<p>Momentum to pass the law followed a series of food scares – many of them domestic – that have heightened public worries about food safety.</p>
<p>But Canadian hog producers aren't just battling the U.S. labelling rules. The industry has been devastated by the high Canadian dollar, a spike in feed costs, and swine flu fears. Ottawa has offered a bailout package for farmers, who say they are losing $30 to $40 (Canadian) for every hog they produce.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- A miscalculation by a nurse under pressure to stockpile supplies for the swine flu pandemic caused the bureaucratic blooper that sent dozens of body bags to a remote First Nations community in Manitoba last month.</p>
<p>"It was a clear overestimation and there was no evidence of ill will or deliberate calculations," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference Wednesday.</p>
<p>The report from a Health Canada probe admits the order for 100 body bags by the nursing station at Wasagamack First Nation - an isolated community of about 1,750 - was "disproportionately high."</p>
<p>The news that 38 body bags were sent to the community caused an uproar among critics and aboriginal leaders, with many taking it as a sobering sign of - and callous response to - the effect of the H1N1 pandemic on vulnerable First Nations communities.</p>
<p>The report blamed an environment of overzealousness that had management advising nursing stations to "to order generously and fill supply rooms" out of concern about backlogs and bottlenecks.</p>
<p>"The repeated message given to nurses from the senior levels down was to 'order big,'" the report said, adding nurses were asked to order supplies for three to four months instead of the usual six weeks.</p>
<p>Deb Merchant, the nurse in charge of the Wasagamack First Nations nursing station, faxed an order to her regional office that included a request for 100 body bags, as well as other supplies. Nurses were told to write the order was related to H1N1 to speed up delivery.</p>
<p>Wasagamack Chief Jerry Knott, who said he doesn't blame Merchant and stressed the community has a good relationship with her, did not think much of the report.</p>
<p>"There should have been an independent review to legitimize the concern, because the body bags were received first rather than the intervention kits," he said.</p>

<p>Despite speculation that Health Canada ordered last month's controversial shipment of body bags to Manitoba's Wasagamack First Nation, the delivery was requested by the community's nursing station in preparation for a possible second wave of H1N1 pandemic, according to a much-anticipated report released yesterday by the Deputy Minister of Health.</p>
<p>Health Canada previously admitted it had "erred" in sending the body bags, but the report said it was Wasagamack's nurse-in-charge who ordered 100 body bags on Aug. 12.</p>
<p>"It was a clear over-estimation," Minister of Health Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference yesterday, adding that there was no evidence of ill-will.</p>
<p>"The person who placed the order made a bit of an error in requesting so much," echoed Grand Chief Ron Evans of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. "Had this person consulted with community leadership, the chief would have known that this sort of shipment would frighten people. This shows the need for better communication across all parties, including Health Canada."</p>
<p>The government-produced report said that while the nurse-in-charge was acting under the recommendation to "order generously" given the community's isolation, the request for 100 body bags was "disproportionately high in comparison to quantities in nursing stations across the country."</p>
<p>Of the 100 body bags requested, 38 were delivered to Wasagamack by Sept. 9, while the rest of the shipment, which had been on back order, was cancelled on Sept. 16 after the Winnipeg regional office was made aware of the abnormally large request.</p>
<p>That same day, Wasagamack's Chief Jerry Knott made headlines across the country after he returned 18 body bags to the Winnipeg office, calling the delivery a grim message from the federal government that his community would not fare well in the event of a second wave.</p>
<p>"Everything sort of skyrocketed," Grand Chief Evans said. "In the heat of the moment, one can understand why things turned out the way it did. It sort of spread like wildfire."</p>
<p>Indeed, the shipment sparked massive outcry among aboriginal leaders who likened the delivery to sending body bags to soldiers in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Grand Chief David Harper, who represents 30 northern Manitoba First Nations communities, called for the resignation of Jim Wolfe, regional director of Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit health branch. Meantime, Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff demanded Ms. Aglukkaq explain the shipment and apologize for sending the message that federal authorities "expect aboriginal Canadians to die."</p>
<p>Yesterday's report said Health Canada recognizes the "anxiety and alarm" caused by the Wasagamack incident, and recommends that the Ministry impose maximum quantity limits and develop a mechanism to flag unusual orders.</p>
<p>"Health Canada will aim to institute stricter centralized controls governing the procurement process for body bags," Ms. Aglukkaq said. "I am confident that everything has been done to ensure that this will not happen again."</p>
<p>Although she said Health Canada supplies "small quantities of body bags to some isolated First Nations communities," the report said the amount ordered by Wasagamack is 10 times more than what is usually stocked at nursing stations.</p>
<p>The report also said that five orders for body bags were placed by other Manitoba nursing stations during August and September, but those requests were on back order and none was shipped.</p>
<p>In particular, the probe shot down reports that God's River First Nations also received body bags, saying, "It has been confirmed that an order had not been placed and no shipment had been received."</p>
<p>Last month's body bag incident heightened tensions in an already uneasy relationship between Ottawa and aboriginal communities, which bore the brunt of the spring H1N1 outbreak. First Nations or Metis people living on or off-reserve make up nearly 40% of the 891 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus to date.</p>
<p>Said Grand Chief Evans: "The silver lining in all of this is that the Wasagamack incident created awareness about the need to help First Nations communities prepare for a possible second pandemic."</p>

</p>
<p>The 2009-10 Winnipeg theatre season opens tonight, kicking off a month bookended by the sublime music of native son Lenny Breau and the ridiculous antics of Puppetry of the Penis.</p>
<p>The Breau bio 5 O'Clock Bells tolls at 8 p.m. at the MTC Warehouse, while across town at the Berney Theatre, the WJT launches with Cherry Docs, the story of a Nazi skinhead who kicks the life out of an innocent bystander with his Doc Martens and is represented by a Jewish legal aid lawyer.</p>
<p>"It is, unfortunately, most likely a timeless play in terms of its exploration of racism and what tolerance actually means," says WJT artistic director Michael Nathanson, who is also helming the production starring Graham Ashmore and Matthew TenBruggencate.</p>
<p>It is rare that MTC is opening with a Warehouse production instead of its traditional mainstage offering. To ensure that It's a Wonderful Life -- A Radio Play (Nov. 26-Dec. 19) runs during the run-up to Christmas, MTC delayed the start of its Dorothy L. Sayers whodunit Strong Poison (Oct. 22-Nov.14).</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Cercle Molière begins its last season before moving into its new theatre with Le Perimetre (Restraint), a dramatic comedy about a couple navigating the tempestuous waters of separation. Next week Prairie Theatre Exchange returns with the world première of Michele Riml's Souvenirs, while Manitoba Theatre for Young People starts with a bang with Aga-Boom.</p>
<p>The stage at the Burton Cummings Theatre is then left to Puppetry of the Penis (Oct. 30), which stretches the boundaries of good taste with another exhibition of the ancient art of genital origami.</p>
<p>As you get ready for these opening nights, here is what you should know:</p>
<p>5 QUESTION</p>
<p>MARKS</p>
<p>Will H1N1 virus make theatre box offices sick?</p>
<p>No one wants to push the panic button, but there are fears that audiences who come together for the shared experience of theatre will also share their germs. The spectre of subscribers staying away out of concern of catching swine flu is creating an uneasy feeling among theatre managers. Its high on the agenda of the Canadian theatres meeting this month. At the very least the actors may have to speak up over the cacophony of coughing.</p>
<p>How are the theatres dealing with lower corporate donations and endowment earnings?</p>
<p>WJT has seen its corporate revenue dip 40 per cent and has compensated by reducing the number of actors on its stage this season from 15 to seven. MTYP is down $100,000 and seasonal staff endured a cut in the number of weeks they work. MTC is also missing about $100,000 in sponsorship money. Artistic director Steven Schipper took on his heaviest workload ever at MTC by helming four productions for "budgetary reasons."</p>
<p>Can Rainbow Stage survive producing one summer musical?</p>
<p>The company did well at the box office with last August's Beauty and the Beast, the second time it's produced the <span class="companylink">Disney</span> musical in five years. It has announced next summer's show will be Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a show it produced six years ago. With its seemingly shrinking playlist, Rainbow brass need to soon announce an expanded season or face fading from the theatrical sky.</p>
<p>What will the implications be of <span class="companylink">Canwest Global</span> going under?</p>
<p>The Aspers, personally and through Canwest, supported virtually every arts organization in the city and many across the country. Without that corporate largesse, all the cultural groups will suffer dramatically. Arts groups will be hard-pressed to make up such generosity.</p>
<p>Will anyone show up to ChurchillFest 2010?</p>
<p>The 10th anniversary Master Playwright Festival celebrates its first woman, England's Caryl Churchill, easily the least known subject. Most theatre-goers will not have seen any of her shows; the lack of name recognition could deter them from heading to the theatre on cold January nights. Still, festival-goers are always willing to try something new and women should support their own.</p>
<p>PREMIERES</p>
<p>Debuting this season:</p>
<p>1. Souvenirs, PTE (Oct. 15- Nov.1) -- Canadian Michele Riml's drama about an estranged father and daughter.</p>

<p>In response to the comment on handwashing in the column "Sorting through this swinish flu" (Oct. 4), I would like to lend some "explanation," as Iain Hunter requests.</p>
<p>He cites a report claiming hand washing makes "little difference," supposedly, in the spread of disease. This is not true. Handwashing is the simplest and most effective preventive measure people can take to protect themselves and others from all respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Both the swine flu (H1N1) and the seasonal flu are respiratory illnesses. As a registered nurse attending and practising at North Island College, I applaud every action that will prevent illness and save lives.</p>
<p>Please continue to wash your hands For further information go to the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control site at bccdc.ca or the Public Health Agency of Canada website at phac-aspc.gc.ca.</p>
