<p>Confusion reigns in flu-shot clinics,</p>
<p>Nov. 1</p>
<p>Confusion? What confusion?</p>
<p>Here is what I understand from Ontario public health authorities:</p>
<p>1. Swine flu is more dangerous than other flus because it kills otherwise healthy victims, especially adults of an age range not typically considered at risk.</p>
<p>2. Such adults are not "priority" candidates for vaccination against this flu virus.</p>
<p>3. I must put aside any reservations I may have about the safety and/or necessity of the vaccination and be sure to get vaccinated urgently.</p>
<p>4. I can't get it that urgently because a) I am not a priority; b) there is a shortage of vaccine.</p>
<p>5. Someone will eventually decide when, where and how I can get the vaccination and I should run out and get it urgently - whenever.</p>
<p>I wasn't worried when this all started, but am becoming increasingly so.</p>

<p>How do I know if I have swine flu?</p>
<p>If you catch influenza this flu season, chances are it's H1N1, which has become the dominant strain. It almost always starts with the sudden onset of a cough and fever. Common symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, sore throat, headache, decreased appetite and runny nose.</p>
<p>Should I still get the H1N1 vaccine if I think I've already had swine flu?</p>
<p>Yes, says Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King. Because you can't confirm that you've had it, there's no guarantee you have immunity.</p>
<p>Do I need my OHIP card to get vaccinated at a public clinic?</p>
<p>There is no need to bring your OHIP card, but you need to provide documentation that proves you live, work or study in the province.</p>
<p>How long will it take after I receive the vaccine to have immunity against the virus?</p>
<p>After receiving the H1N1 flu vaccine, most people will start to develop immunity within 10 days with just one dose.</p>
<p>If I get sick with H1N1 flu virus once, does that give me immunity or can I get infected with it again?</p>
<p>In most cases, when a person is infected with an influenza virus and recovers, they develop antibodies that provide them with immunity to that particular virus. In the case of the H1N1 flu virus, the vaccine will be recommended to everyone, but is not necessary for people who have had a laboratory-confirmed H1N1 flu virus infection.</p>

<p>The only time Paul Frustaglio broke down was when his son's coffin left his sight.</p>
<p>With his wife and son Will, 10, by his side, the composure Frustaglio maintained during his eulogy to his "best friend" evaporated as he bowed his head and shut his eyes outside the church.</p>
<p>That moment spoke to the heartbreak of the funeral.</p>
<p>"Burying your own kid is the most horrific thing for any human being. There is no plan, no instinct, nothing to guide you," Frustaglio had said, as dozens wiped away tears in All Saints Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>More than 700 people celebrated the life of Evan Frustaglio, the 13-year-old hockey player who died of complications from the H1N1 virus on Oct. 26.</p>
<p>The otherwise healthy right-winger had complained of a sore throat and dry cough at a hockey tournament the weekend prior. Three days later, Evan lost consciousness after a bath. He was pronounced dead in hospital.</p>
<p>Evan's friends, family and teammates - the latter group wearing jerseys over shirts and ties - filled the large church near Eglinton Ave. W. and Royal York Rd. for the funeral service Monday.</p>
<p>White roses, carnations and lilies lined the altar, some arrangements in the shape of hockey sticks. The largest was addressed to "Our big boy - Love Daddy, Mommy and your brother."</p>
<p>During the service, it was hard to ignore the cause of Evan's death. Instead of shaking hands as a sign of peace, mourners were asked to nod at one another.</p>
<p>Rev. Vito Marziliano said Evan's death "heightened awareness" of H1N1 and "solicited actions that may save many."</p>
<p>Following Evan's death, Toronto public health officials opened H1N1 vaccination clinics on Oct. 29, four days earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Thousands of parents who had heard about Evan's death lined up at the clinics to have their children vaccinated.</p>
<p>Marziliano told Evan's parents they were blessed - not because their hearts were broken, but because they had loved, and were loved, by their son.</p>
<p>Frustaglio told mourners he was amazed his son's death had captured the nation and had become the face of H1N1.</p>
<p>"We must learn from our loss and become educated on a disease that took our son's life," he said.</p>
<p>Frustaglio said his family was overwhelmed by people who had been touched by Evan's death, noting 19,000 had joined a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page dedicated to his son. He called it the "Evan effect."</p>
<p>He read a letter the family received from a stranger.</p>
<p>Enzo Zangari recalled a chance encounter at a restaurant with a boy he believed to be Evan. Zangari had overheard the young man telling his brother how important school was, and noted the boy had ordered escargot.</p>
<p>"'Evan, if I can get so much out of sitting at a table next to you and admiring the way you carried yourself and spoke to your brother and parents ... I can only imagine the kind of lasting impression you left on the people who knew you for any length of time,'" Frustaglio read from the letter he said "struck a chord" with his family.</p>
<p>Frustaglio paused only a few times as he described his son: Evan was the kind of kid who always looked after his younger brother, instructed his parents to call him before they left work, and broke the neighbour's windows with his slap shot.</p>
<p>"Never let the obligations of life distract you from the cherished gift of family," he told mourners.</p>
<p>As the church emptied, a young boy in a Sidney Crosby jersey placed a homemade blue hockey stick next to a photo of Evan.</p>
<p>As the candles were extinguished, only balled up tissues remained on the church's pews and floor.</p>
<p>Outside, family friend Mary Hammill said she didn't know how Frustaglio kept his composure.</p>
<p>"Your heart breaks for the family. You can't put it into words. The strength Paul and Ann-Marie showed was unbelievable."</p>

<p>The province is looking to set up vaccination clinics in schools and workplaces after a chaotic start to its mass immunization campaign and as cases of H1N1 rapidly increase.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the campaign got off to a bumpy start last week, health officials say the province is stepping up its efforts by calling in retired nurses, opening more than 30 flu assessment centres where sick people can get medical help, and doubling the number of mass vaccination clinics so that a total of 2.2 million Ontarians will be immunized by week's end.</p>
<p>"It's all hands on deck right now," Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King told a news conference Monday.</p>
<p>The province will only say "tens of thousands" have been immunized to date. An estimated 2.4 million Ontarians are considered at high risk of complications and are in the priority groups for flu shots, as are health care workers.</p>
<p>When the province moves from immunizing priority groups to healthy Ontarians, it is possible vaccines will be offered in places of employment and in schools, she said.</p>
<p>"We will consider expanding the settings dependent on who we are actually offering vaccine to. So once we get into the healthy, working-age population, we will start looking at workplace clinics. When we are into school-age children, we will be looking at optimum ways of reaching school-age children," she said.</p>
<p>The province has been under pressure to offer the flu shot in more places after mass vaccination clinics last week were overwhelmed with long lines and angry people, some of whom waited hours or were turned away.</p>
<p>"We are focused on making things better," Health Minister Deb Matthews said, noting the number of mass vaccination clinics is being increased to 100 from 50.</p>
<p>"Public health units across the province learned from last week. We made it very clear they needed to do better," she added.</p>
<p>Hospitals are being pressed to immunize more people. To date, they have been focusing on staff and in-patients.</p>
<p>Matthews said she has signed a special order allowing doctors to bill OHIP for telephone consultations with patients in an effort to take pressure off the health system and contain the spread of the virus. Normally doctors can bill the public health system only if they see patients in person.</p>
<p>King said rates of influenza-like illness are higher than what is normally seen at peak time during a flu season. There are 82 Ontarians in hospital with the virus right now, compared with 14 in August. There have been 31 H1N1-related deaths in Ontario so far and officials are investigating the death of a 12-year-old Waterloo girl to determine if H1N1 was the cause.</p>
<p>King said there is widespread flu activity in densely populated areas, including "some areas around the GTA." There have been outbreaks in schools, in one university setting and in a couple of hospitals, she noted.</p>
<p>It's difficult to get current information on flu activity from public health units. But Glendene Collins, a spokesperson with Durham's public health unit, said there are currently 13 outbreaks in the region, mostly in day nurseries. As of Oct. 30, 46 schools in the region had more than 10 per cent student absenteeism.</p>
<p>The province is in the process of opening 31 flu assessment centres in areas where emergency rooms and doctors' offices are swamped. Individuals with flu symptoms can visit these centres for help from health care professionals, taking pressure off other parts of the system. Centres are already open in Hamilton and Niagara, and consideration is being given to opening centres in Toronto and Peel.</p>
<p>The province had hoped to begin immunizing healthy Ontarians Monday. But because of production glitches, there is only enough vaccine for such groups as health care workers, pregnant women and people with underlying health problems.</p>

<p>It's the big question facing many companies: What effect will the H1N1 pandemic have on business?</p>
<p>Companies, many held back by the strong dollar and tepid demand as the country struggles out of recession, are being urged to plan for absenteeism rates of up to a third of their work forces as the flu season plays out.</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic means up to eight million more Canadians could fall ill this season than during a regular flu season, the Winnipeg-based International Centre for Infectious Diseases (ICID) estimates, a blow to productivity.</p>
<p>Other potential wrinkles relating to the virus include a more distracted work force, cautious retail spending and reduced tourism and transportation activity, economists warned.</p>
<p>If the virus becomes widespread, “it will throw sand in the gears of business activity and that will reduce productivity in the near term,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at <span class="companylink">BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc</span>. “It adds to the uncertainty about the economic outlook.”</p>
<p>Some companies are planning for absenteeism and making sure they won't see a drastic drop in productivity. At Vancouver-based <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>., two-thirds of the investor relations team was asked to work from home for a week to test out remote access systems, said the company's vice-president of risk management and chief internal auditor, Kasey Reese.</p>
<p>Estimates vary on the cost a pandemic carries. The World Bank estimates that a worldwide flu pandemic, in general, could shave 0.7 per cent to 4.8 per cent of global gross domestic product, depending on severity.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> has calculated a mild pandemic would cut annual economic growth by 2 percentage points, while a severe outbreak would reduce growth by 6 percentage points from where it would otherwise be.</p>
<p>Sherry Cooper, <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> chief economist, says vaccinations should limit the damage to the economy.</p>
<p>In Germany, a study last week with the insurer Allianz predicted the flu could cost up to €40-billion ($63.7-billion), or between 0.4 and 1.6 per cent of GDP, depending on the severity.</p>
<p>It's too early to estimate costs for Canadian businesses. But they could easily outstrip the $2-billion price tag of the SARS outbreak in 2003, said Amin Mawani, director of Schulich School of Business's health industry management program.</p>
<p>“It will be significantly greater than SARS,” Mr. Mawani said. “That was largely a hospital-based illness. This is community-based and national.”</p>
<p>Absenteeism poses a key challenge, particularly among small businesses with more limited resources.</p>
<p>Flu season already means more people call in sick. This year, depending on the rates at which people get vaccinated, an additional three million to eight million Canadians could get sick, “so that's really going to affect businesses,” said Wendy Schettler, director of public health programs at the ICID, a Canadian non-profit organization that advises businesses on pandemic planning.</p>
<p>Many businesses she speaks with aren't unduly worried because they can handle a week of high absenteeism.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that some may face absenteeism rates of 25 to 30 per cent over an extended period. “It ebbs and flows,” she said. “It's not just a week. It's weeks and potentially months.”</p>
<p>A recent business survey suggests pandemic planning is still not a top priority. Just 22 per cent of respondents to an Ontario Chamber of Commerce survey last month have an emergency plan in place and another 27 per cent say they're developing one. The results aren't much different from a similar survey the chamber conducted in 2005.</p>
<p>Not everyone is pushing the economic panic button. <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> hasn't factored the impact of H1N1 into its forecasts, said Beata Caranci, the bank's director of economic forecasting.</p>
<p>“We didn't make any allowances for the drag on GDP,” she said, because the public and companies are more prepared than they were during SARS. If there is an impact, she figures it will likely be only during one quarter.</p>
<p>The most vulnerable sectors are travel, restaurants and hotels, she said. Conferences could see a drop in attendance and some retailers may be affected as people avoid malls.</p>

<p>Hand hygiene is in vogue because of the H1N1 influenza outbreak, but the hoarding of bottled sanitizers threatens to create temporary shortages.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span>, which makes and distributes Purell for retailers, cautions that supplies may be limited in some regions because of red-hot demand.</p>
<p>And then there's Ohio-based GoJo Industries, which developed Purell and is a manufacturer of the product for the commercial market – offices, schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>GoJo anticipated that interest in its sanitizer would soar, but it is scrambling to keep pace with “unprecedented demand,” running its production lines around the clock.</p>
<p>GoJo is telling institutions and distributors to avoid stockpiling, saying hoarding will create unnecessary shortages.</p>
<p>“GoJo will continue to manufacture and ship products to distributors … so there is absolutely no need to stockpile product,” the company said in a message on its website.</p>

<p>I just finished watching Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq get slaughtered, yet again, in a national television interview regarding her handling of the H1N1 crisis. She is out of her depth and everyone, including herself, knows it. Although I have little pity for any aboriginal person who chooses to represent or associate with the Conservative party, it is apparent Prime Minister Stephen Harper has no problem throwing her to the wolves. When all is said and done, Aglukkaq will be removed from cabinet and viewed as a political liability from this point on. What a great opportunity to showcase the inability of those who are least likely to support his party and prove his partisan beliefs.</p>
<p>Given the severity of the issue as indicated by government and media, (I personally think it has been overblown -- a child in Africa dies every 30 seconds from malaria) -- you would think Harper would have reacted immediately in assuring he had his best people handling this issue. Instead, he appears to be doing nothing, and is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Where's the soap?</p>
<p>Where is the soap in Winnipeg? With all the going on about H1N1, my recent trip to Winnipeg has me wondering that you do have something to be scared about. My first stop was at a (female) restroom at Canadian Tire. Lo and behold! Not one drop of soap left there, and I walked out of there feeling I collected more germs than anything else. Fast forward three hours; shopping is done and winter tires are now on my car. I decide to stop at a <span class="companylink">Zellers</span> restroom. Where is the soap?</p>
<p>Both dispensers empty and both rolls of paper dispensers also.</p>
<p>Now I have more germs and a perfect breeding ground for them. Then off for supper we went. Decided not to go wash my hands, because I was afraid to find no soap and blowing off at the poor waitress.</p>
<p>How about doing a survey or investigating on your own to see how many have had the same experience lately. This almost has me running for my H1N1 vaccine before I start on my Christmas shopping six weeks from now!</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Selinger ready to shuffle the deck - Cabinet could be revealed today</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen    </div>
<div>482 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>PREMIER Greg Selinger will unveil his cabinet as early as today -- a process that took him longer than he wanted because it's turning out to be a bigger shuffle than he first anticipated.</p>
<p>Insiders say the original game plan called for a smooth transition from ex-premier Gary Doer's inner circle to a new team that would run the NDP government for the next two years. And no one wanted to rattle things too much during a flu pandemic and when the economy is showing faint signs of recovery.</p>
<p>But with as many as three major cabinet posts up for grabs -- finance, justice and aboriginal and northern affairs -- Selinger can't help but shuffle the deck in a major way. The bodies to fill those vacant portfolios have to come from somewhere, either from other existing cabinet jobs or the ranks of the backbench.</p>
<p>On Monday, the legislature was buzzing Selinger would introduce his cabinet by the afternoon, but that buzz turned to puzzled murmurs as word went around Selinger still hadn't put the final touches on his inner circle.</p>
<p>"He still hadn't notified everyone," one source said.</p>
<p>The big question is who will become the next finance minister? Selinger has already said it could be a cabinet minister who sits with him on Treasury Board, meaning they would be familiar with the government's balance sheet. Ministers who currently sit on Treasury Board include Agriculture Minister Rosann Wowchuk, Conservation Minister Stan Struthers and Infrastructure Minister Ron Lemieux. The most talked-about candidate is Wowchuk, but if she got the finance gig, who'd replace her as agriculture minister? One possibility is Selkirk MLA Greg Dewar.</p>
<p>The other major change is likely to occur in justice as there's increasingly speculation Attorney General Dave Chomiak will be stepping down. The general rule has been you have to be a lawyer to be attorney general, and the only other lawyer in the NDP caucus is Andrew Swan. If Swan becomes justice minister, who fills his shoes in competitiveness, training and trade? Keep in mind Fort Rouge MLA Jennifer Howard.</p>
<p>The last change is in aboriginal and northern affairs. The post was held by the late Oscar Lathlin, and has been handled by the high-profile Eric Robinson.</p>
<p>Bets are he gets one of the province's more important jobs, and that a rookie MLA moves into Robinson's old job as culture, heritage, tourism and sport minister.</p>
<p>One job that won't change is Health Minister Theresa Oswald's. The Selinger government will not do anything to undermine her as she leads the charge against the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>How it all plays out should be clearer, a lot clearer, by as early as today than it was Monday.</p>

<p>For whatever comfort it might have brought to family and friends of Evan Frustaglio, the rites of the Catholic funeral mass also offered a stark reminder of the disquieting way in which the 13-year-old Toronto boy died last week.</p>
<p>The sign of peace, typically a handshake just before communion, was replaced with a polite nod to help stem the spread of the H1N1 virus, the same disease that killed Evan with such terrifying speed a week earlier.</p>
<p>“For the health and safety of all … please refrain from shaking hands as a sign of peace,” Rev. Vito Marziliano told the 1,000 mourners who filled the semi-circular nave of All Saints Church late yesterday morning.</p>
<p>As the broader Canadian public dealt with another day of waiting for the H1N1 vaccine amid updates on the spread of the swine flu pandemic, Evan's family – parents Paul and Ann-Marie and younger brother Will – endured one of the worst days of their lives.</p>
<p>Paul Frustaglio, flanked by his wife and surviving son, mounted the altar to deliver a halting eulogy to his eldest boy, who collapsed in front of him after a bath last Monday, just two days after developing flu-like symptoms. Mr. Frustaglio tried to resuscitate him, but he was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later.</p>
<p>His remarks were replete with Evan's best attributes – his protective instinct toward his family, his unbridled passion and work ethic for hockey, his precocious wisdom in guiding his little brother. He read a letter he received this week from a complete stranger, who overheard the Frustaglios at a restaurant celebrating Evan's birthday recently, and was struck by the boy's well-mannered maturity.</p>
<p>Mr. Frustaglio marvelled in thanks for the outpouring of condolence messages, more than 19,000 of them, that the family has received from across the country and around the world, attributing them to what he called “the Evan effect” – his son's capacity to touch the lives of others.</p>
<p>“It amazes me that Evan's death has captured a nation trying to find answers to a disease that is currently wearing the face of our beautiful son,” he said.</p>
<p>For all of that, Mr. Frustaglio was under no illusions about the ordeal his family is facing now, and will face for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“The job of burying your own kid is the most horrific thing for any human being,” he said, the crowd's silence broken only by sobs. “There is no plan, no instinctual feeling, nothing to guide you.”</p>
<p>As he wound down his eulogy, Mr. Frustaglio offered a poignant instruction, to “hold your kids close and squeeze the hands of your loved ones. The kiss of life is fleeting, over before you know it, so never let the obligations of life distract you from the cherished gift of family.”</p>

<p>VANCOUVER -- Every 15 minutes, a nurse called out a warning to the dozens of people lined up early to get the H1N1 vaccine: “You will be turned away if you don't meet the eligibility requirements.”</p>
<p>And, every 15 or so minutes, a few people would slip away.</p>
<p>Young families, caregivers of small children, and people with chronic illnesses stayed in line, bundled in sweaters and jackets and sheltered under umbrellas, braving the rain for a chance to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Nurses at the temporary clinic installed at the former Mount Pleasant Community Centre began administering doses at noon.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, those eligible for the shot were able to enter without a wait.</p>
<p>Those who remained in line but did not meet the eligibility requirements were turned away at the door by a representative of Vancouver Coastal Health.</p>
<p>Inside the clinic, the smell of antiseptic mingled with the cries of children, and vials of the vaccine were stored in small blue coolers. Nurses vaccinated about 100 people an hour.</p>
<p>The speedy processing time and the stringent eligibility rules meant short waiting times.</p>
<p>“I thought the lineup was going to be way worse than it was,” said Lana Dooling, who was vaccinated along with her toddler, Finn.</p>
<p>As for the shot itself, “I didn't even feel it, and I hate needles, and he cried for one second, just a little cry,” she said.</p>
<p>But lining up in the rain isn't necessary for anyone in a high-priority group, says John Carsley, a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health.</p>
<p>“Eighty per cent of the vaccine that we've received here in Vancouver has gone to family physicians,” Dr. Carsley said.</p>
<p>He suggested those eligible for the shot check in with their family doctors prior to attending a mass clinic.</p>

</p>
<p>VICTORIA -- The B.C. government is imposing an end to a seven-month-long strike by ambulance paramedics, citing pandemic infection rates that are expected to rise in B.C. in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“Right now, our entire health system is operating at full capacity to manage the impact of the H1N1,” Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon said shortly after introducing legislation to end the labour dispute. “As we come forward to a period where we know the H1N1 pandemic is going to escalate and get worse in the coming weeks and months, we do really need all hands on deck.”</p>
<p>The ambulance system has been operating at essential-service levels since April 1, and Mr. Falcon said there is no evidence that the strike has harmed health care. But he said the pandemic is taxing the system now, and letting the dispute continue would mean “potentially putting lives at risk.”</p>
<p>The union representing paramedics said imposing a one-year deal, retroactive to April 1, won't help fix the ambulance service. “His comments around the H1N1 pandemic are laughable at best,” said spokesman BJ Chute.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced shortly after Provincial Health Officer Perry Kendall announced that demand for the flu vaccine will continue to outstrip supply for the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“I would ask again that British Columbians be patient and wait their turn,” he told a media briefing in Victoria.</p>
<p>Until this week, the province has targeted three priority groups: individuals under 65 years of age with chronic disease, pregnant women and individuals – including native people – living in isolated communities.</p>
<p>Starting this week, the list has expanded to include front-line health- care workers and children between six months and five years of age. As well, people who are in household contact with babies younger than six months old or people with compromised immune systems are now eligible.</p>
<p>But just as the number of people who can have the shot rises, the supply is dropping.</p>
<p>Next week, B.C. expects to receive 25,000 doses of the vaccine, which will be reserved for pregnant women who want a formula that does not contain an adjuvant. Another 63,000 units containing the adjuvant will also be delivered.</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall said the province's plan to roll out the vaccinations on a graduated basis according to need is working, despite reports that some people who are not eligible have been vaccinated. “It's really strictly an honour system,” he said.</p>
<p>Clinics have reported they cannot keep up with the demand and have been forced to turn people away.</p>
<p>At Vancouver's private Copeman Healthcare Clinic, where patients pay as much as $3,900 in annual fees to get premium services, the chief operating officer said clients who failed to meet the eligibility criteria have been refused the vaccine.</p>
<p>The clinic just obtained 300 additional vaccines yesterday, “but it's not nearly enough,” said Chris Nedelmann.</p>
<p>In the Downtown Eastside, a clinic that serves high-risk urban aboriginals was also turning patients away.</p>
<p>Tina Braun of the Vancouver Native Health Society said she was horrified last week when she was given only 80 doses in the first release.</p>
<p>“All our patients are vulnerable, it was hard to decide who is more vulnerable,” she said.</p>
<p>This week, the clinic received another 500 units. Ms. Braun took 100 doses to another clinic, which also caters to a high-risk group in the community. Now she is faced with running out again.</p>
<p>By the end of this week, health authorities hope to have provided roughly 800,000 vaccinations across B.C. – that is, roughly 20 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>But healthy British Columbians who are not considered to be at risk should plan to wait until at least the end of this month to be vaccinated – while the infection rates continue to rise.</p>
<p>Even many health-care workers who are supposed to be on the priority list as of this week will not likely be offered a shot.</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall said he'd like to have had an adequate supply of the vaccine weeks ago, but given the delays, many people will have to wait until Christmas.</p>
<p>However, he maintained that is not too late to bother with getting it: The flu strain is likely to be present in B.C. for the next couple of years.</p>

<p>It turns out talk about H1N1 isn't cheap – in fact, it's providing a new revenue stream for physicians.</p>
<p>Patients ailing with the flu, who need to speak to their Ontario doctors, can now pick up the telephone, thanks to a ministerial order. If the chat is less than 10 minutes long, physicians will be paid $11. But if patients are particularly loquacious, talking 10 minutes or more, their doctors will be enriched by $27.55.</p>
<p>Previously, Ontario doctors were not paid to provide telephone advice, which caused sick patients to migrate to busy waiting rooms. The payment is aimed at providing those patients with care while keeping them home. “We're going to keep working hard until we get this right,” Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews said yesterday.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Canada's cohesive national vaccination strategy is starting to show cracks, with one province pointing its finger at others.</p>
<p>British Columbia's Health Minister Kevin Falcon took aim yesterday at other provinces for allowing all comers to receive the H1N1 vaccine despite agreeing weeks ago to give the shots in order of priority.</p>
<p>“The evidence is supporting the approach we took in British Columbia. Some other jurisdictions that felt some political pressure and decided to open it up to everyone, that turned into a fiasco. I don't believe that is the way to go,” he said.</p>
<p>With the country's largest-ever immunization campaign in only its second week, some provinces, including Alberta and Ontario, have flip-flopped on plans not to turn people away, and are tightening rules because the vaccine supply is dwindling.</p>
<p>The nationwide shortage of flu vaccine comes at an inopportune time for health officials: A resurgent H1N1 virus, which has been most severe in the young, has a once-skeptical public suddenly rushing to get the shot. <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, Canada's vaccine supplier, told the federal government only Thursday that it will ship 436,000 doses to provinces and territories this week, far less than the roughly two million anticipated, because it had to interrupt production at its Ste-Foy, Que., plant to make a version of the vaccine for pregnant women.</p>
<p>The result: Some clinics are turning people away, others are closing and provinces are redrawing priority lists.</p>
<p>British Columbia rolled out the vaccine last week for pregnant women, people under 65 with chronic conditions, and those in remote communities, and has expanded the list to include some health-care workers, children under five and those who care for infants.</p>
<p>Alberta health officials said they would vaccinate whoever showed up. Ontario did the same, resulting in waits as long as six hours.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely safe to say that public health units across the province learned from last week,” said Deb Matthews, Ontario's Health Minister.</p>
<p>“… Some did a very, very good job of delivering the vaccine in a way that was respectful of the people who were lining up to get the vaccine. Can't say that happened right across the board.”</p>
<p>The shortage of vaccine forced H1N1 clinics in Alberta to close abruptly over the weekend.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert told the legislature there yesterday that the vaccination program has been “refocused” with priority given to high-risk groups, including pregnant women. “No one likes to turn away citizens of this province from receiving their vaccination, but, unfortunately with a limited supply, we are left with no choice,” he said.</p>
<p>The country bought 50 million doses, enough to vaccinate all Canadians. Six million have been delivered so far, and another 400,000 are being distributed this week. The shortage this week stems from the fact that in late September, GSK had to halt its production of the immune-boosting adjuvant vaccine to start making 1.8 million doses of unadjuvanted vaccine that the federal government ordered for pregnant women. There is no data on the safety of adjuvants in pregnant women. Although both vaccines contain the same active ingredient, or antigen, the unadjuvanted version requires far more, which means GSK had to shift its production focus entirely to fill the order.</p>
<p>But health officials didn't foresee such a huge shortfall.</p>
<p>Critics blasted the federal government during Question Period yesterday for botching the vaccination program, and called an emergency H1N1 debate in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>“Provincial and regional health authorities have been blindsided by a lack of flu vaccine and the public has been left confused and frightened. The federal government had seven full months to do two primary things: provide the vaccine and send a clear and consistent message to Canadians on H1N1,” Liberal MP Todd Russell said. “How is it that the federal government could get it so wrong on both counts?”</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said guidelines to focus on vaccination for the most vulnerable were established over the summer with the provinces, territories and chief medical officers of every jurisdiction. She said the government launched the vaccination program a week early, and it affords protection to the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>Kim Goodman got the relief of knowing her two young children are as protected against the H1N1 flu as they're going to get.</p>
<p>And she didn't have to line up, jostle frantic snifflers or risk being turned away after a six-hour wait.</p>
<p>In fact, seven-year-old Alex and five-year-old Jake got their left arms pumped full of adjuvanted vaccine several minutes before their scheduled appointment at Medcan yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Their golden ticket? Their dad's corporate membership.</p>
<p>And in the lobby of the clinic's downtown office building less than half an hour after the family of four arrived, her inoculated children equipped with lollipops and twirling in circles, Ms. Goodman said she wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>“There's no way I would take them to a clinic. I don't want them to pick up 50 other things.”</p>
<p>Ms. Goodman isn't impressed with the public rollout so far: Co-ordination has been “pretty pathetic,” she said.</p>
<p>Public-health authorities across the country are struggling to deliver the unexpectedly scarce vaccine to as broad a swath of the high-risk public as possible. And as people start lining up before dawn at public clinics, Ms. Goodman and her husband, Mitch Finkelstein, argue that their decision to turn to a private clinic, where Mr. Finkelstein's annual membership costs his law firm thousands of dollars, shows just how badly Canada's largest-ever inoculation program is failing.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, I think this kind of proves socialized health care doesn't work,” Mr. Finkelstein said. Medcan, the elite, private medical centre whose patient-only access to H1N1 vaccine has raised fears of two-tier access to treatment in the face of a growing flu pandemic, said yesterday it will make 20 per cent of its vaccine available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>This announcement came a day after Medcan said it was willing to allow non-members access to its vaccine, but only if they were directly referred by Toronto Public Health. Health officials said yesterday they don't make special referrals for any clinics.</p>
<p>Medcan and the Copeman Healthcare Centre's Vancouver office are two of several private medical clinics that are doling out the vaccine to their patients, along with hundreds of physicians in B.C. and Ontario. Health authorities say they've been giving the vaccine to whichever physicians qualify and abide by their guidelines – profit-based or not.</p>
<p>The privately run Cleveland Clinic in downtown Toronto, which charges upwards of $2,000 for an annual membership, said it has requested a vaccine shipment from public-health officials and plans to make it available to patients as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But in the face of continuing vaccine shortfalls, the prospect of thousands of doses of vaccine being doled out to patients at for-profit medical clinics doesn't sit well with some. Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews said on the weekend that she hoped to look into whether giving the vaccine to private clinics was ultimately a good use of resources.</p>
<p>Michael McBane, national co-ordinator of the advocacy group Canadian Coalition for Health, said giving publicly funded vaccines to clinics whose patients pay for care flies in the face of Canada's public health-care system.</p>
<p>“The vaccine is for high-risk – it's not for high-income,” he said. “Those clinics are income-based, so they're discriminating on the basis of income. That's a perversion of public-health measures.”</p>
<p>In Ottawa, opposition MPs blasted the fact that private clinics in Toronto and Vancouver have received doses of the vaccine.</p>
<p>“We just have to make sure that access to the vaccine should in no way depend on the size of your wallet,” Liberal MP Bob Rae said.</p>
<p>“I think the federal government has to take some responsibility in not establishing clear guidelines as to how the drugs would be distributed.”</p>

<p>$18 billion</p>
<p>Estimated value of global H1N1 vaccine market if there is a severe pandemic</p>
<p>$4 billion</p>
<p>Extra sales for <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> as a result of the new vaccine orders</p>
<p>$100 million</p>
<p>Sales of face masks by <span class="companylink">3M Co</span>. in the last quarter</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>While thousands of Canadians line up for H1N1 vaccinations and people around the world worry about the spread of the virus, the pandemic is proving to be a financial windfall for many big corporations.</p>
<p>Yesterday <span class="companylink">Clorox Co</span>., best known for its bleaches and other household products, said sales of its disinfectant wipes are at all-time highs. Sales have been so strong the company's profit jumped 23 per cent in the third quarter to $157-million (U.S.).</p>
<p>“The upside related to the H1N1 flu was well above our forecast given the rapid spread of the virus,” said Larry Peiros, chief operating officer of Clorox North America.</p>
<p>Clorox is one of many companies benefiting from the H1N1 pandemic. Last week, <span class="companylink">Kimberly-Clark Corp</span>. said sales of its face masks jumped 40 per cent year over year during the third quarter, and <span class="companylink">3M Co</span>. said it sold $100-million worth of masks in the last quarter.</p>
<p>“Our factories have been running flat out since May of this year to keep up with demand,” said Pat Campbell, 3M's chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Even products not directly tied to fighting H1N1 are benefiting.</p>
<p>According to Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Information Resources Inc</span>., a market research firm that monitors U.S. drugstores, sales of cough syrups and cold medications are up 8 per cent this year, while sales of hand sanitizers have climbed 19 per cent.</p>
<p>“Pretty much everyone who does something in influenza has gained from it,” said Hedwig Kresse, an infectious diseases analyst at Datamonitor in London.</p>
<p>Drug companies stand to see the biggest gains. Global H1N1 vaccine sales are expected to exceed $7-billion this year, even with a mild pandemic, according to analysts at Sarasin & Co. in Switzerland. If the outbreak is more severe, sales could hit $18-billion.</p>
<p>British drug giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which is making vaccines for use in Canada, said last week that it has received orders for 440 million doses from governments around the world. That is up from 291 million orders the company reported in August. The extra doses could bring the company's total annual revenue from the vaccine to around $4-billion, analysts estimate.</p>
<p>That's a fraction of <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>'s total annual sales, around $50-billion, but it is rising faster than any other company product.</p>
<p>France's <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span>, another big vaccine maker, expects its profit to increase by 11 per cent this year because of H1N1. And Britain's <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca</span> said it sold $152-million worth of H1N1 vaccine to the U.S. government during the third quarter.</p>
<p>The windfall from H1N1 has put company executives in a difficult spot. While happy at the financial gain, they don't want to be seen rejoicing over a pandemic.</p>
<p>During a conference call with analysts yesterday, Clorox chief executive Don Knauss tempered his delight at the company's sales figures by noting that Clorox is working with nurses and teachers to help prevent the spread of H1N1. Last month, Clorox executive vice-president Beth Springer said the company was “capitalizing, appropriately, on H1N1 where it breaks out.”</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> came under fire recently from international development organizations for selling the bulk of its vaccines to wealthy countries, which can afford the $10 a shot cost. The company said it would donate 50 million shots to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Last week, Douglas Baker of <span class="companylink">Ecolab Inc</span>. tried to steer a careful line after announcing the company expects sales of its hand sanitizers to double in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>“I mean, we're glad we're able to help the communities that we serve and the customers meet the challenges that H1N1 represents,” Mr. Baker said before adding: “It certainly helped sales.”</p>

<p>Ottawa -- Remember those Peanuts cartoons, the ones where Lucy always pulls away the football just as Charlie Brown is about to kick it? That's how I feel now that the Ontario government has suspended offering H1N1 flu shots to the general population until the supply increases.</p>
<p>What did governments expect when they encouraged citizens to seek inoculation? That people wouldn't turn out? I despair. They're the gang that can't shoot straight, even into our willing arms.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if the government were a company in the private sector right now, it would see its consumer loyalty plummet to close to zero. Oh yeah, that actually is the case.</p>

<p>Computer networks are becoming a wellspring of democratic accountability. Vancouverites can look up the exact longitude and latitude of every public drinking fountain in their city on an Excel spreadsheet, or check out the comprehensive data that is registered with the city's land titles office (with names removed). This summer, Calgary passed a motion to authorize the release of much of its city data. Toronto is the latest jurisdiction to practise digital transparency; yesterday it released information on the capacity of licensed child care centres, official geographical data on city parks and information on bylaw infractions at apartment buildings, among other datasets.</p>
<p>The promise of such data dumps is synthesis; if, that is, a nascent generation of benevolent and engaged computer programmers can step forward and translate the data into useful forms. The private sector has led the way, as anyone who has plotted online map directions can appreciate. But data can also be combined to show new and surprising relationships, and can help citizens find out what elected officials are really up to.</p>
<p>For example, evidence that the federal government's stimulus package disproportionately benefited Conservative ridings took opposition parties and journalists months to crunch through. If governments commit to providing that information in raw form, computer coders can get to work, mapping and illustrating conflicts and favouritism in short order.</p>
<p>Freely available government data could make services more efficient and enhance quality of life. Imagine an iPhone application that provides real-time updates of the waiting times at different H1N1 vaccine clinics, helping people find the shortest line. An application that shows the location of city drinking fountains could help joggers plot a preferred course; it might also spur them to ask why their city doesn't have as many fountains as others.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. has probably gone the farthest in informing the public: It tells its citizens the location of each active construction permit, relates information about 311 phone calls, purchase orders and registered vacant property, and publishes crime report data that can be layered onto neighbourhood maps.</p>
<p>It will be a while before geeks can keep governments accountable through their BlackBerries – this is still a work-in-progress, and incentives need to be created to encourage programmers to connect with citizens. New York City and San Francisco are holding contests encouraging software developers to create mobile phone-based applications that best use, manipulate and present city data.</p>
<p>Canadian activists now have the building blocks to do the same, using 0s and 1s to construct a better democracy.</p>

<p>The bumps in Canada's biggest-ever vaccination campaign that sparked an emergency debate in the House of Commons last night seemed inevitable. From the beginning of the H1N1 pandemic there has been a calm, verging at times on complacency, from federal officials. On top of that, jurisdictions overlap, making for a cacophony of voices. As a test of Canada's ability to handle a truly severe pandemic (which this one may yet become), it has raised serious questions.</p>
<p>The debate gives the opposition parties, and Parliament as a whole, a chance to express a sense of urgency about the outbreak. Too often the process of the past several months seemed mere spoon-feeding of the public at news conferences. The United States, by contrast, held a televised town hall session featuring governors, health officials, school leaders and President Barack Obama, at which anxious questions were raised in the open. Perhaps because the public was left out, public health officials were surprised by the demand for the vaccine – Toronto, the biggest city in the country, initially opened just two clinics for all the people most at risk from the disease.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has daily briefings on the swine flu. His administration's handling of it is considered a major test of his leadership. In Ottawa, by comparison, Prime Minister Stephen Harper flubbed the question of whether he was going to be vaccinated. “If it's recommended,” he said, seemingly the last to know that it was recommended, and that the entire country was waiting on the regulatory t's and i's to be crossed and dotted.</p>
<p>It is not farfetched that a more severe pandemic will come along some day, perhaps soon. Peter Doherty, a Nobel Laureate immunologist from Australia, said when he was in Canada last week that he is surprised, given that great numbers of animals and people live in close proximity in some parts of the world, there haven't been more pandemics (Dr. Doherty thought the world may be doing something right in surveillance and prevention).</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq insisted in the House yesterday afternoon that the vaccine was ready “two weeks ahead of schedule.” In fact, some Canadian children have died in the past week and yet the vaccine isn't ready yet for children, except those under 5. In these circumstances, Canadians have a right to demand more from government, and last night's debate is a step toward that accountability.</p>

<p>Ottawa -- Polling “notable Canadians,” The Globe and Mail got three “yes,” two “undecided” and four “no” responses as to whether they will be vaccinated against H1N1 (Apathy, Anxiety And Acceptance – Oct. 31). The naysayers seek protection in Purell, a fist full of vitamins and robustness in their own health. Or they are just plainly distrustful of the medical profession (“I almost died two years ago because of a [screw-up] in hospital”). A wonderful cross-section of opinions.</p>
<p>I suppose if we wish to allay public fears of the flu, we could poll nine teenagers, who can be counted on to be invincible. Or perhaps we should poll nine medical scientists?</p>

<p>jdoyle@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>You know what really annoys me? Oh you do. Yes you do. Think about it. Use that whip-smart, Globe and Mail-reading brain of yours and think.</p>
<p>No, not that. Guess again. No, no point getting annoyed about the new-look, heavy-duty light-show and dubious direction of CBC News. CBC goes its own way. Spends the money, does the thing, pays no attention to you, me or that professor feller at the university who thinks it's a crock. No. If CBC wants to turn The National into So You Think You Can Stand (Canada), so be it.</p>
<p>Consider this – terrible, terrible things are happening in our world. We are puzzled and concerned. The H1N1 threat. Our soldiers die in Afghanistan. Carnage on our roads. Massive car bombs in Iraq kill hundreds of people. Pakistan's push against the Taliban.</p>
<p>And yet, look at what takes up acres of space in newspapers, daily. Entire pages. The war between broadcasters and cable and satellite companies over a proposal to make cable and satellite corporations pay for carrying local TV channels. That's what. The cable and satellite companies began taking out full-page ads (and running ludicrous TV commercials) to attack the proposal. The other side countered, doing likewise. That, my friends, is what really, really annoys me.</p>
<p>I want an end to the phony war over fees to fund local TV. And I blame the cable crowd for starting up the big ads and the bickering. It's ludicrous and it's time to figure it out.</p>
<p>Take note of this: Last week in the United States, Fox and CBS announced they're pushing cable companies for fees. The Canadian situation is not unique. Stop the grandiosity and the bickering and look at the big picture.</p>
<p>On Monday, an ad for the cable crowd featured a big photo of a couple with a child, looking very concerned. Tall dad guy with a frown. Wife beside him looking on the verge of tears. And a little kid in a stroller looking very vulnerable. The suggestion is that Canadian broadcasters want to ruin their way of life. What rubbish. This is madness, all this insulting, overblown nonsense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on another page, the broadcasters are shouting that cable companies make vast, vast profits. This is true, actually. And the broadcasters say that the cable and satellite posse has been getting a free ride. Time to pay up.</p>
<p>I urge you to find the report I saw in The Wall Street Journal. The gist is this: “Television-network owners <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">CBS Corp</span>. are pushing cable operators to pay monthly fees to carry their broadcast TV stations.” Sound familiar? <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>. owns Fox. That mean two of the four major U.S. networks, Fox and CBS, are demanding fees from cable companies that usually carry their stations free. According to the Journal story, CBS has been quietly pushing this agenda for some time and has had some success.</p>
<p>Here, it's a tad more gnarly. There's an attitude that both sides here are wrong. Both greedy, both are abominations.</p>
<p>Well, no. That's not helpful. Recently, Rob Wells, known to us all as Ricky on Trailer Park Boys, and key writer on the show, weighed in on the issue, in an opinion piece that appeared in several newspapers.</p>
<p>He wrote this: “You've probably seen the big broadcasters join together in their ‘Local TV Matters' campaign. I agree, local TV does matter. The broadcasters want cable companies to pay for it. I agree, they should. When big cable earns $2-billion in profits, when they pay American stations upward of $300-million for their signals but give nothing to Canadian broadcasters, there's something wrong.”</p>
<p>His suggestion – one shared by the “creative” guild representing actors, writers and others in the Canadian TV racket – is that cable pay up to help fund local TV, but the money must not merely go to local news coverage. “Revenues from fee-for-carriage must be seen on the screen in the form of new, original local, dramatic and comedic programming – broadcasters can't be handed a bag of money to take on their L.A. shopping sprees.”</p>
<p>Fair enough. Cable companies, shut up. Pay up. Don't pass it on to the consumer. Broadcasters get the fees they want but a portion has to be spent on making drama and comedy. Good, fine. Enough with the melodrama.</p>
<p>Let's hope the CRTC makes a smart decision and understands that the couple with the kid, if they exist, are more worried about H1N1 than the barking and snarling of rich and profitable cable companies.</p>

<p>V (ABC, CTV, 8 p.m.) is a jazzed-up remake of the 1980s miniseries which itself spawned a short-lived series. Aliens arrive. Are they good or evil? Certainly they are good-looking and charming, on the surface. Chief among them is Anna (Morena Baccarin), who sets out to seduce a news anchor (Scott Wolf) and thereby the world. Meanwhile, a bunch of people warn that the aliens are evil. V is fun, with a slight undercurrent of paranoia about “others” taking over the USA.</p>

It examines why, in recent years, there's been a dramatic increase in the number of children being diagnosed with serious psychiatric disorders in the U.S., and prescribed medications that are just beginning to be tested in children. The drugs can cause serious side effects, and little is known about their long-term impact. J.D.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>In Newfoundland, a welcome born of history and sacrifice</b>
</div><div>OLIVER MOORE   </div>

<p>ST. JOHN'S -- They are the flip-side to polls showing sliding support for the monarchy in Canada – several thousand people who gathered last night to welcome Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and to celebrate Newfoundland's bond with Britain.</p>
<p>Dorothy Burridge, 61, noted that many residents of the province retain strong feelings for the Royal Family because the island was a British dominion only 60 years ago.</p>
<p>“We were all British subjects until 1949, so they were very dear to us and I think you just grow up with it,” she said. “I really feel British. If I travel … I never say I'm from Canada, I always say I'm from Newfoundland. Because we were one country so recently.”</p>
<p>A number of people on their way into the event mentioned fears of the H1N1 virus, but none was willing to miss the chance to see the Prince and the Duchess.</p>
<p>“You know, heritage and our head of state, or future king,” said 50-year-old Jeff Smith, explaining why he'd come. “The way I look at it, the Catholics got their Pope so the Protestants got to have their king.”</p>
<p>A poll released yesterday by The Canadian Press showed that Canadians who hold such views are members of a shrinking group. The poll, conducted by Harris-Decima, revealed that only 31 per cent of Canadians feel that Charles should be king, while 41 per cent would rather see the throne pass directly to his son, Prince William. Prince Charles was chosen as the most popular royal by a mere 4 per cent of respondents, while 39 per cent felt ties with the monarchy should be severed after the Queen dies.</p>
<p>Although some at Mile One Stadium last night acknowledged they had come for the spectacle as much as to show loyalty, they offered a warm welcome as Charles and Camilla began an 11-day royal tour.</p>
<p>Five-year-old Allison Clarke had a fairy-tale vision as she approached the venue with her mother. Asked what came to mind when told a prince would be visiting the province, she said shyly: “I think of going to the castle.”</p>
<p>She would have appreciated the pomp that followed. Among the elaborate ceremonies was a 21-gun salute as Prince Charles inspected a guard of honour drawn from the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.</p>
<p>Decimated at Beaumont Hamel on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the regiment has special significance for Newfoundlanders. To this day, many here mark July 1 as a day of mourning, rather than the anniversary of Confederation. Wearing a poppy in his lapel, Prince Charles stopped to chat with several members of the regiment before mounting a dais for a rendition of O Canada.</p>
<p>“Given our deep devotion to members of the Royal Family and their devotion to Canada, these visits are regarded as homecomings by Canadians,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said moments later. “On this day of celebration we say to you, Your Royal Highnesses, welcome. Our home is your home.”</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams, greeted with extended applause from the crowd as he took the podium, struck a less formal tone. He spoke about the province's cultural cachet and reminisced about his time at Oxford, where he remembered appreciating the Beatles and the miniskirt phase then sweeping Britain.</p>
<p>The Prince, noting that he was on his 15th visit to Canada, said this one was special as a chance to introduce his wife to the country. “Every time I come to Canada a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream, and from there straight to my heart,” he told the crowd. He praised this country's natural beauty and “the strength of the Canadian character,” citing past military missions and the troops now serving “with the greatest possible distinction” in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Charles also took the opportunity to sound the clarion call for action against what he called “the threat posed to all humanity” by climate change.</p>
<p>“We are at a defining moment for our civilization,” he said. “Unless we can all, both individually and collectively, take the actions which we now know are necessary, the future is going to be very bleak indeed.”</p>
<p>The royal couple had no further public engagements last night and go this morning to Cupids, a small town near St. John's that is celebrating its 400th anniversary next year.</p>

<p>Canadian workplaces have been doused in hand sanitizer, littered with urgent hand-washing notices and peppered with colleagues talking swine flu around the water cooler. But if there's one resounding message to sniffling employees, it's this: Don't be a hero.</p>
<p>Coming into the office with the chills or even a persistent sneeze has become an offensive workplace faux pas as lines for the H1N1 vaccine snake through public buildings and hysteria about the virus hits fever pitch.</p>
<p>“I think it's being viewed as passing irresponsible,” says Rod Phillips, president of Shepell.fgi, consultants on health and productivity in the workplace.</p>
<p>“People are very conscious of what their co-workers think and … no one wants to be sick with H1N1. It used to be people cough and say ‘excuse me.' Now they cough and say ‘I don't have H1N1.' ”</p>
<p>Most employers are becoming more flexible on sick policies, asking fewer questions when an employee calls in sick, and are sending ill workers home, says Claude Balthazard, director of HR excellence at the Human Resource Professionals Association.</p>
<p>Bosses are also asking sick employees for a quick phone or e-mail check-in before they return, he says.</p>
<p>Despite this, some worker bees may continue to schlep into work even with a feverish temperature.</p>
<p>“In some organizations it's interpreted as loyalty if you show up even when you're sick,” he says. “But you'll notice that this time around, the climate is that that's not particularly well seen.”</p>
<p>Andrea S., who declined to give her last name, says she scoffed at a few employees in her office when they recently arrived there sick.</p>
<p>“I'm like, ‘You can work from home, why are you here?' ” says the 38-year-old information-technology systems analyst in Toronto. “They thought that it wasn't that bad. But again, it's not realizing that some people have lower immune systems and they're susceptible to any little thing.”</p>
<p>When they're feeling under the weather, people who can work from home, should, she adds.</p>
<p>But there are still a few very stubborn employees out there, some HR departments find.</p>
<p>“I think those who would tough it out normally are still toughing it out,” says Sue Zuccala, the Ottawa-based vice-president of human resources at <span class="companylink">Fleishman-Hillard</span>, a Canadian public-relations company. People with bad colds have stayed home as a precautionary measure, but there hasn't been a spike in absenteeism, she says. “And we haven't had anyone really abusing it,” she says, noting that most people have been able to work from home.</p>
<p>The company also massaged its sick-leave policy to allow interns to take a paid day if they're very ill.</p>
<p>But some employees don't have the luxury of benevolent bosses and flexible sick policies. Going into work sick is a tough call for employees on temporary contracts or working jobs where they aren't paid if they don't show up, says Sonia Singh, an organizer at the Workers' Action Centre, a community-based worker's advocacy association in Toronto.</p>
<p>“People, unless they're feeling really, really sick, are going to go into work because [they don't want to] lose a day's pay and because if you're working in a temp job, you may not have a job to go back to.”</p>
<p>Chris Bond, who works on contract as an art director and stood in line for his shot at Toronto's Metro Hall yesterday, says he's not taking any chances.</p>
<p>“Even if I was not working on contract and working full-time, I would try to take the time [off if I were sick],” he says, adding this will be his first winter on a contract and that he doesn't fear for his job should he fall ill.</p>
<p>Still, it seems there's an upside for temps in a flu-spooked work environment, at least for Sharlene Massie, chief executive officer of Calgary's About Staffing temp agency. In the past month “temp hours” have doubled to about 500 a week, meaning more work and more pay for short-term employees.</p>
<p>“Even healthy people are staying home because they're scared of getting sick. This is creating job opportunities for people,” she says.</p>
<p>Still, it's not easy to halt the eye roll when yet another employee calls in sick, some managers say.</p>
<p>“As someone who almost never takes sick days, I do tend to resent people who seem to call in sick all the time, but not specifically with regards to H1N1,” said Shannon Couch, vice-president of product planning and development at the <span class="companylink">Beacon Group</span>, a Toronto-based human-resource consultancy.</p>
<p>Her husband, Kyle, says he took his first sick day in a long time just over a month ago, thinking he might have swine flu himself.</p>
<p>“The actual sickness is probably the third thing you consider, after realizing the workload, perception to your employer – all sorts of things are far more top of mind than saying, ‘I'm going to make my co-workers sick,' ” he says.</p>

</p>
<p>For a team that has been hit by the flu, the Detroit Red Wings were feeling pretty good about themselves Monday.</p>
<p>Defencemen Niklas Kronwall, Brian Rafalski and Jon-athan Ericsson all missed practice with the flu, but the dressing room remained upbeat Monday with the Wings having just secured six of 10 points on their longest road trip of the season.</p>
<p>The Wings hope to have all three in the lineup tonight when they host Boston at Joe Louis Arena (7 p.m., TSN, Versus).</p>
<p>"The best thing was winning the last game (in Calgary)," forward Kris Draper said. "That's something we needed.</p>
<p>"We're looking for things to build on and create momentum. We created some of that. We played a solid hockey game and didn't give up a lot."</p>
<p>Detroit will play nine of 14 games at home this month with none of the five road games requiring flights of more than two hours.</p>
<p>The favorable schedule arrives at a time when the Wings feel like they are turning the corner. The Wings have outshot their opponents by an average of 15 shots per game in the last four contests.</p>
<p>"The Edmonton game, I think that was wake-up call for a lot of guys," Draper said.</p>
<p>"That was one of the most humiliating experiences we've had. We just weren't doing anything.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Babcock was also pleased with how his club finished out what was looking like a potentially disastrous road trip when the Wings dropped the first two games of the five-game journey.</p>
<p>He added he's seeing progress in his team's cohesiveness.</p>
<p>"Its taken us longer to get going," Babcock said. "It's night and day, but we aren't winning as much. We're playing harder than anytime we did in the first half of last year."</p>
<p>MAY ON THE MEND</p>
<p>Brad May reported good pro-gress on his injured eye Monday and hopes to be back in the Wings' lineup this week.</p>
<p>"Surprisingly, real good," May said of his eye. "It was scary on Saturday though.''</p>
<p>May, who didn't practise, was scheduled to see a doctor Monday after taking a Jason Will-iams' stick in the eye while on the bench Saturday in Calgary.</p>
<p>FLU SCARE</p>
<p>As reporters entered the Detroit dressing room Monday, Kris Draper jokingly questioned ev-eryone on their health.</p>
<p>With the swine flu scare, the Wings are taking precautions.</p>
<p>"We're overwashing any time we get the chance," he said.</p>
<p>With the swine flu vaccine in short supply, none of the players has yet been inoculated.</p>
<p>TOUGH CRITIC</p>
<p>With only one goal and three points in 12 games, Nick Lidstrom gave himself mixed grades to this point.</p>
<p>"I haven't been producing as much as I have in the past," said Lidstrom, who leads Detroit with a plus-seven.</p>
<p>"Overall, I can play better."</p>

<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>NEW VIDEO PLEA FOR MISSING MADELEINE</p>
<p>LONDON -- British police today released an Internet video of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared two years ago in Portugal at the age of three, with tanned skin and darker hair which she might have if held captive in a warmer climate.</p>
<p>The video shows a digital image of what Madeleine might look like now if she had darker skin and shoulder-length hair. Another image shows her with paler skin.</p>
<p>The minute-long video, produced in seven languages, also contains film footage of Madeleine before she disappeared, including of her boarding a plane and playing on a staircase.</p>
<p>Jim Gamble, head of Britain's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, urged the public to help spread the video online including via social networking cites and Internet chat rooms.</p>
<p>Gamble said the video was aimed at pricking the conscience of anyone who might be connected to those behind her disappearance.</p>
<p>"The person we are looking to reach is likely to be a partner, family member, friend or colleague of the person or people who were involved in Madeleines disappearance," Gamble said in a statement.</p>
<p>SWEDEN TO OUTLAW VIEWING CHILD PORN</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM -- Sweden plans to make it illegal to look at child pornography, beefing up its ban on possession of child porn that does not apply to those who merely view such images on the Internet, it said.</p>
<p>The new law would make it illegal to "actively gain access to child pornography" even if the images were not technically in a person's possession, the centre-right government said.</p>
<p>KARADZIC REGRETS MUSLIMS ESCAPED</p>
<p>THE HAGUE -- Radovan Karadzic's one regret over the massacre at Srebrenica was that some Bosnian Muslims "got away," prosecutors alleged on Monday.</p>
<p>The former Bosnian Serb president again refused to attend the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague as Alan Tieger, the prosecutor, concluded his case. He accused Karadzic of personal responsibility for "one of humanity's dark chapters" -- the slaughter of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica.</p>
<p>FIRST SWINE FLU DEATH IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>VIENNA -- An 11-year-old Italian girl became the first person in Austria to die of swine flu on Monday, doctors at the hospital where she was being treated in Innsbruck announced.</p>
<p>The young girl from Bozen, in northern Italy, was hospitalized on Oct. 23 in Innsbruck after first visiting a general practitioner with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>She was in a life-threatening condition for several days and was placed on a respirator after suffering lung failure.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>EX-OFFICER KILLED AT HOME IN IRAQ</p>
<p>MOSUL -- A former Iraqi army colonel during Saddam Hussein's rule was assassinated in front of his home in the northern city of Mosul on Monday, eyewitnesses and police said.</p>
<p>Abdul Khalaq Mohammed Saeed, now head of security in Mosul for mobile phone company Asiacell, was shot by gunmen as he stood at the gate to his home.</p>
<p>Saeed, in his mid-50s, is survived by his wife and four children.</p>
<p>$5M BOUNTY ON TALIBAN LEADERS</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan put a bounty of $5 million on the heads of Taliban leaders in the country on Monday after a suicide bomb killed at least 35 people near military headquarters in Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>The blast was aimed at people lined up to withdraw money from a bank. Many of the victims were elderly people who had wanted to withdraw their pensions. Four soldiers were among the dead. More than 30 were injured.</p>
<p>Hours after the first blast, another suicide bomber struck in the eastern city of Lahore at a police checkpoint.</p>
<p>ISRAEL FREES 12 HAMAS MPS</p>
<p>RAMALLAH -- Israel on Monday released 12 Palestinian MPs from the Islamist Hamas movement who were detained in 2006 after Gaza militants captured an Israeli soldier, officials said.</p>
<p>Another MP was freed late Sunday, bringing to 37 the total number of Hamas lawmakers released in recent months, including parliamentary speaker Aziz al-Dweik, who was set free in June.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Israeli Prisons Authority said the lawmakers were released because the 40-month period of their administrative detention had expired. None was charged with anything.</p>
<p>It was unclear why Israel had decided to release the deputies at this particular time, since administrative detention can be prolonged indefinitely.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>FOUR TO HANG FOR ALBINO MURDER</p>
<p>DAR ES SALAAM -- A Tanzanian court on Monday sentenced four suspects to death by hanging for the murder of a 10-year-old albino boy last November, an official said.</p>
<p>State lawyer Edwin Kakolaki said the presiding judge ruled the prosecution had "proved its case beyond reasonable doubt" and handed down the sentence in a court in the country's northwestern Shinyanga town.</p>
<p>The ruling brings to seven the number of suspects sentenced to death for the murder of albinos in Tanzania. Three men were handed death sentences in September by the same court.</p>
<p>CONGO TROOPS KILL 500 SINCE MARCH</p>
<p>KINSHASA -- Democratic Republic of Congo soldiers have "deliberately killed" more than 500 civilians since March during an offensive targeting rebels in the country's east, Human Rights Watch said Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, a top UN official announced that they had withdrawn its support for Congolese army units operating in the east, accusing its soldiers of killing 62 civilians.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>BRITAIN SNUBBED OVER POISON KILLING</p>
<p>MOSCOW -- Britain's foreign secretary was publicly snubbed by his Russian counterpart on Monday when he was told it was "absolutely unrealistic" to expect Moscow to extradite the prime suspect in the murder of the Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko.</p>
<p>In a tense joint appearance in Moscow, David Miliband and Sergei Lavrov publicly disagreed about whether Britain had even supplied Russia with sufficient evidence on the case. Litvinenko died in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium in a London hotel.</p>
<p>Later, Miliband returned the snub, rejecting a proposal to try the case on Russian soil, hinting that Moscow was incapable of organizing a fair trial. "This crime took place in London," he said. "That is where the trial should take place." He said Britain would continue to press the case with Russia.</p>
<p>MAN KILLED NEAR PUTIN'S OFFICE</p>
<p>MOSCOW -- Gunmen shot dead a prominent Russian businessman in his car on Monday a few hundred metres from the seat of Russia's government, state investigators said.</p>
<p>Shabtai von Kalmanovic, a businessman and president of the Spartak female basketball club, died at the scene, investigators from the state prosecutor's office said in a statement.</p>
<p>More than 20 shots were fired at the car outside Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's office at the Russian White House, the government headquarters, it said.</p>
<p>The killers fled in a car and Kalmanovic's driver, who was wounded, gave chase but had to abandon it because of his wounds.</p>
<p>DEATHS IN UKRAINE FUEL SWINE FLU FEARS</p>
<p>KIEV -- Ukraine raised its death toll from flu and respiratory problems on Monday, while Kiev's mayor suggested a Champions League match should be played without spectators amid a swine flu scare.</p>
<p>Kiev had made an urgent appeal to world powers for help battling the spread of the A(H1N1) virus on Sunday, after declaring 60 people had died of respiratory complications and flu. The health ministry put this figure at 67 on Monday, without detailing when the deaths took place or explaining the jump in the toll.</p>
<p>He said 255,000 cases of flu and acute respiratory illness had been registered among the country's population of 46 million.</p>
<p>CLINTON WISHES HE'D DIED IN OFFICE</p>
<p>ISTANBUL -- Former U.S. president Bill Clinton said on Monday he would have preferred to leave the White House in a coffin because he loved being commander in chief, but signalled his political life is over.</p>
<p>"It's good that we have a (term) limit. Otherwise I would have stayed until I was carried away in a coffin. Or defeated in an election," Clinton said at a conference in Istanbul. "I loved doing the job."</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>CANADIAN CAN'T SUE U.S. OVER TORTURE</p>
<p>NEW YORK -- A Canadian man who was detained at a New York airport and then moved to Syria, where he says he was tortured, cannot sue the United States, a federal appeals court ruled on Monday.</p>
<p>Maher Arar, a Syrian-born software engineer, was arrested by U.S. officials during a 2002 stopover in New York while on his way home to Canada and then deported to Syria because of suspected links to al-Qaida.</p>
<p>Arar says he was imprisoned in Syria for a year and tortured and has sued top U.S. government officials, claiming his civil liberties were violated.</p>
<p>In a 7-4 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with a lower court that Arar could not sue U.S. officials.</p>
<p>CENTRAL AMERICA</p>
<p>CUBA SLAMS BOOK BY CASTRO'S SISTER</p>
<p>HAVANA -- Cuba's state-run media on Monday condemned a just-published book in which Fidel Castro's sister admits she spied for the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>The country's media added that the expose proves that the former Cuban leader was a "victim" of decades of U.S. targeting.</p>
<p>"The truth is in full view: Fidel Castro is the victim, the offended person, the individual against whom they conspired," wrote the government-run La Jiribilla magazine.</p>
<p>The condemnation by the Havana government follows the admission by Juanita Castro, 76, in her Spanish-language book that she worked with the U.S. spy agency.</p>
<p>In the book, which went on sale last week, Juanita, the fifth of seven Castro siblings, writes that she aided the CIA during the 1960s, at a time when the United States was plotting to assassinate her brother and replace his Communist regime.</p>

<p>The second week of the country's H1N1 immunization campaign got underway Monday with Canadians up at the crack of dawn to line up for their shots while MPs in Ottawa worked late into the night to hold an emergency debate on the federal government's pandemic response.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq defended how the Conservatives have handled the public health crisis following accusations from Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff, New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton and other opposition MPs that the government dropped the ball and failed Canadians.</p>
<p>"I can't believe that any MP on any side of this House could look at the lineups in his or her riding and be able to say that this response to the pandemic is being executed properly or blame some other jurisdiction," said Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett, who requested the emergency debate.</p>
<p>The opposition parties said the federal government should be doing more to help the provinces and territories implement their vaccination programs and communicate more effectively with Canadians. They also criticized the timeline for the vaccine's delivery and suggested the health minister is not living up to her responsibilities.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq noted she has conducted more than 40 news conferences, hundreds of interviews and regular briefings for her opposition critics and she emphasized there is "not a shortage" of vaccine and that every Canadian who wants one, will get a shot by Christmas.</p>
<p>"We are dealing with a very new disease and we have been working and will continue to work as quickly as possible, given the circumstances. This government's planning efforts have paid off. No matter what else comes our way, we are well-prepared," said Agluk-kaq.</p>
<p>Accusations that the government has botched the file have been flying about Parliament Hill for weeks but heated up in recent days following the revelation Thursday that <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> "overstated" how much vaccine would be available for distribution this week.</p>
<p>The opposition parties are laying the blame for the reduced supply -- about 400,000 doses this week instead of about two million -- at the feet of the federal health minister, who was taken for a rough ride in question period earlier in the day.</p>
<p>With a week of experience now under their belts, cities across the country have fine-tuned their strategies for delivering the vaccine and for targeting the high-risk groups who are supposed to get it first.</p>
<p>A wristband policy was adopted in Ottawa on Monday to help ease lineups and counter the possibility of fraud. The policy comes after at least one person advertised on a local website that they were willing to stand in line for a fee of $15 per hour.</p>
<p>In Toronto, another young victim, 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio, was mourned Monday by family and friends at a funeral attended by 1,500 people.</p>
<p>The young man's sudden death is credited with putting a human face on H1N1 virus and prompting people to stand in long lines across the country for the vaccine. Clinics in Toronto opened the same day he died.</p>

<p>It has proven to be an ill-advised system for individuals to self-select for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>At various advertised locations, long lineups of potential vaccine recipients wait while organizers advise that only those who belong to the "risk" population should stay in line.</p>
<p>Of course, those who want the vaccine stay in line regardless, knowing full well that they won't be questioned further regarding their "risk."</p>
<p>Those who have serious health risks find themselves still without the vaccine having lost days of work and wages in order to chase vaccine opportunities across the region.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu-shot system working and worth the wait</b>

<p>Our family recently joined many others in trying to receive an H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination. We waited in a long line at the Gordon Head Recreation Centre on Wednesday before being sent home without a shot.</p>
<p>I was ready to join other writers to complain about the long wait outside, the lack of information and other logistical problems.</p>
<p>However, on Thursday we went to the vaccination clinic at West Shore Town Centre Mall and had a much more positive experience. After waiting approximately five minutes we were given a slip that assigned a time window when we could return in the afternoon. When we did we were able to go right inside and get our shots. Everyone on staff was in good spirits and very helpful. The clinic is working much more effectively due to the larger number of nurses to offer shots, the larger space indoors and the improved logistics with assigned time slots.</p>
<p>Several people have expressed questions about whether to receive a flu shot, especially for the H1N1 strain. This is due in part to the repeated reference to most H1N1 cases as being "mild."</p>
<p>As I understand, a "mild" flu just means you are not admitted to the hospital and survive the encounter. Even a mild case of flu still means several days in bed with high temperatures, severe headaches and muscle aches and an extended period of weakness and lack of energy. Catching the flu also means you have probably helped pass the flu along to several other unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>I have two sore shoulders today from the shots, but I consider that a mild situation compared to the misery of catching the flu and knowing I had helped it spread to others.</p>

<p>I was one of the many who waited in line recently at the K of C and held a spot until my wife brought our boys out of school early to get the H1N1 shot. We were lucky enough to get it. I didn't expect to get one but when it was offered, I accepted.</p>
<p>What a mess. Welcome to the greater Northwood school area traffic problem, exacerbated by this poorly prepared clinic. There was no parking for the nurses who had to hike to get there. Traffic was parked on both sides of the street, people lined up on the roads, school buses caught in this, policing services tied up; it was awful.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions. As a child in the '60s, I recall the X-ray bus coming to school to check us for tuberculosis. How about renting some motor homes and sending them to the schools and acute care/special needs facilities to service them?</p>
<p>Here is a great suggestion forwarded from a friend. There is an empty <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> store right next to the Devonshire Mall on a bus route. Rent this, and establish a vaccine clinic there over the next few months to service the rest of us. It's easy to get to, tons of parking, many road routes in and out, and you could put the entire cue inside the store. Also, make the hours 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. so shift workers can make it there.</p>
<p>I'm sure these services can be duplicated in the county. This was poorly planned. People are not getting the service and protection they should.</p>

<p>I was present at the H1N1 flu clinic on Oct. 29, with my two teenage daughters. We left after being told only high-risk individuals would be seen. Does the health unit not realize that the most recent people who have died in this region have been young adolescents, pre-teens and teenagers? Doesn't that make my kids high risk?</p>
<p>In the Cornwall region, they are vaccinating all kids 18 and under because they are considering them high risk. We haven't heard of anybody nine and under dying, yet those kids are being given the priority here in Essex County.</p>
<p>My daughter teaches swimming lessons, she is surrounded by kids in the high-priority group every week. If that's not high risk, then what is?</p>

<p>Parents and guardians, are you aware that there is a pandemic flu season upon us? Are you aware that H1N1, also known as swine flu, has been awarded the high level of crisis and concern by the World Health Organization. Note that this is not a good award either -- it's the worst award the world health care professionals can assign to any health issue and it needs to be taken seriously. Swine flu is a serious infectious virus and can be fatal.</p>
<p>So, you ask, why should I care? Well, I care because I want parents to pay close attention to their children this season and others as well. If kids are sick they cannot be in school. Remember the infectious part of the H1N1 virus --it's highly contagious and other children can fall ill. So, we need to all step up and make sure we are protecting not only our own children but other kids as well.</p>
<p>Like it or not, we all play a role, as parents, guardians, educators and health care providers in making sure all the children in our community stay healthy and are protected against H1N1. So, this year, so that they don't get infected with H1N1, let's get them vaccinated. Let's keep our kids home from school and/or daycare when they are sick and let's keep a close eye on the ones we love so dearly -- our children. As parents and guardians, we have a responsibility to all the children in our community and we have to do everything we can to keep them all safe and healthy.</p>
<p>Please take time to think about the children this flu season and let's all do the responsible thing to protect them all from falling ill.</p>
<p>John Parent,</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Paramedic strike's forced end inevitable</b>
</div><div>Les Leyne   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>748 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>The back-to-work law that forces ambulance paramedics to end their strike is an affront to democracy.</p>
<p>Just like all the other affronts to democracy over the past years that have successfully defused stalemated labour wars.</p>
<p>Nobody who takes democratic principles seriously can cheer wholeheartedly when government puts the hammer down and quashes a strike.</p>
<p>But it's remarkable how many times that governments of different persuasions have successfully done just that. It causes some resentment, but the parties involved get over it remarkably quickly.</p>
<p>There's one notable exception: The Hospital Employees' Union work stoppage of 2002.</p>
<p>The union fought the Liberal government's reaction to that all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada and won big time. That example is a unique, as it involved government legislation destroying an entire contract and contracting out several thousand jobs.</p>
<p>But for run-of-the-mill labour disputes that reach the point where no negotiated solution is possible, back-to-work legislation seems to work just fine.</p>
<p>When the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the government started talks on a new contract for ambulance paramedics, they were light-years apart. Eight months later, they are just miles apart.</p>
<p>But the gap is big enough that everyone realizes the impasse is here, to stay.</p>
<p>The essential services designation curtailed the paramedics' right to strike right from the start. Most people seem to think their job action amounts to little more than driving ambulances around with meaningless "On Strike" signs plastered on them.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, though, the numbers show the strike is having an impact. The Health Ministry said that, in the Lower Mainland, the number of ambulances out of service each month has jumped to 150 from the usual number of 12.</p>
<p>Paramedics are booking off sick or not responding to call-ins from their employer. The government said the 127 managers in the system have been working 60 to 80 hours a week for seven months now and are at the breaking point.</p>
<p>All this as the H1N1 pandemic begins to accelerate and some hospitals report high absentee rates due to illness.</p>
<p>Health Minister Kevin Falcon said the system is running flat out to cope with H1N1 and can't afford to have the ambulance service operating at less than peak effectiveness.</p>
<p>The other thing he said tipped his hand. "The holiday season is fast approaching," said Falcon.</p>
<p>But the first example of a crisis cited at a ministry briefing was an ambulance shortage at Whistler.</p>
<p>So don't kid yourself that the Olympics weren't a factor as well.</p>
<p>The upshot was the Ambulance Service Collective Agreement Act introduced yesterday afternoon. It formalizes the government's last offer, made in September. It's a one-year deal retroactive to last spring that includes a three-per-cent wage hike.</p>
<p>The overall proposed contract was characterized by the union as "a piece of crap." But the wage offer won some support. CUPE members were just readying to vote on it after a month-long campaign against the deal by the union executive.</p>
<p>The vote now is irrelevant, which brings the full impact of this type of legislation home.</p>
<p>To ease the effects of what the government is doing, Falcon also offered to appoint an industrial inquiry commissioner to get to the bottom of the rest of the arguments. That idea has been in play for months, but it just created a fresh round of bickering over the terms of reference.</p>
<p>Falcon also sounded amenable to doing something about the situation of paramedics in rural communities.</p>
<p>New Democrat Leader Carole James said the bill represents government's failure to deal with the dispute. The NDP will be voting against it.</p>
<p>Still, it will pass, just like the long list of back-to-work bills before it.</p>
<p>Liberals have legislated an end to labour disputes in forestry, at B.C. Ferries, at universities, in schools and in hospitals.</p>
<p>Previous NDP governments resorted to the same thing a few times over the years, as well.</p>
<p>The one wild card this time around is the court decision arising from the HEU case, which appeared to elevate collective bargaining to a Charter right.</p>
<p>That issue will still have to play out.</p>
<p>But at this point, the government is on reasonably solid ground in calling an end to this war of attrition.</p>

<p>It was 8:30 a.m., half an hour before yesterday's flu-shot clinic opened, but already a tuqued-and-mittened crowd of 200 snaked down the side of UVic's McKinnon Gym. The first of them, a clutch of parents with toddlers in strollers, arrived at 6:15.</p>
<p>It resembled the lineup outside the old Fort Street passport office, or maybe the queue to the women's washroom at a Michael Bublé concert, or, considering the high number of toddlers, one of the child-heavy crowds along the route of the Olympic torch relay.</p>
<p>(And by the way, the protesters who disrupted the relay Friday should be congratulated for achieving the impossible: making people side with Gordon Campbell. What's your next trick, stomping on kittens to protest homelessness? Saving old-growth forests by pinching babies? I have some brussels sprouts should you wish to huck them at nuns.)</p>
<p>At precisely 9 o'clock, the gym doors swung open and a pleasant woman began handing out slips of paper indicating when people could expect their shots. She also checked their eligibility: Are your children under five? Are you under 65 and do you have an underlying condition? No way of knowing who was fibbing in reply, but the honour system appeared to be working.</p>
<p>It was all very orderly, very Canadian -- very Victorian, Astrid Braunschmidt said -- which is to say everyone was willing to obey the rules as long as nobody else was allowed to budge.</p>
<p>Good thing they were patient, because by 9:05 a.m. the line had grown to 400 people. It actually shrank considerably as the tickets were dispensed; still, it was 11:30 before mum, dad and a couple of kids who arrived at 8 were able to stagger glassy-eyed back to their minivan.</p>
<p>Health authorities hope 800,000 British Columbians will have been vaccinated against H1N1 by the end of the week.</p>
<p>That's one in five of us, and should cover pretty much everyone at greatest risk, says B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall. It better, because as of next week supply problems will slow the flow of vaccine to a trickle. Healthy people should expect to wait until the end of this month or the beginning of December before lining up. Kendall says anyone who wants a shot should be able to get one by Christmas.</p>
<p>Christmas? Jeez, this feels like a race, flu versus vaccine, with us as the prize at the finish line. No way to know when this pandemic will peak, Kendall says. Super.</p>
<p>The thing is, this is still the flu, not the Black Death. The vast majority of people who get this bug won't need treatment, let alone hospitalization.</p>
<p>Kendall expects H1N1 will kill fewer people than does the seasonal flu -- the great difference being that H1N1's victims are likely to be younger, their average age 30 years below that of those who die of the seasonal variety.</p>
<p>Which is the sort of stat that tightens the parental sphincter. Don't panic? This is our kids they're talking about. No one wants to be the one who didn't take junior to the hospital soon enough.</p>
<p>That helps explain Sunday's scene at Victoria General Hospital, where the line stretched right outside from the emergency department waiting room. The Vancouver Island Health Authority confirms it is seeing a surge of people reporting flu-like symptoms. ("If you are experiencing a fever and cough, please wash your hands and apply a mask before proceeding," reads the sign at the entrance to the new VGH emergency ward.)</p>
<p>Yet most of the flu sufferers cramming into the ER shouldn't be there, VIHA says. It advises calling 8-1-1-healthlink first (though I got a recorded message when I tried that yesterday).</p>
<p>It also says to go to viha.ca/h1n1 and click on the button reading Self Care Booklet: Be Prepared Be Well, which offers advice on when to seek medical care.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kendall says it takes 10 days for the vaccine to take effect, so even after getting a shot, those in high-risk categories should consider asking their doctors for Tamiflu, to be taken within 12 hours of the onset of the flu.</p>
<p>And don't panic, even in an orderly, Victorian fashion.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province to impose paramedic contract; Falcon invokes H1N1 pandemic to justify legislation ending strike</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Fowlie   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>415 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>The British Columbia government introduced legislation yesterday that would impose a contract on the province's striking paramedics.</p>
<p>The move comes with less than a month to go in the current legislative session -- the last regular sitting of the house before the 2010 Winter Olympic Games.</p>
<p>"With the H1N1 pandemic impacting the acute-care system and winter and the holiday season fast approaching, the public needs certainty that they'll have the care they need in an emergency," said B.C. Minister of Health Services Kevin Falcon.</p>
<p>"The decision to introduce this legislation was a difficult one and certainly not one that we take lightly. But it was clear that after seven months of failed attempts to reach an agreement and with no hope for a negotiated settlement in sight, we had to act."</p>
<p>Falcon added the dispute has had a "profound impact on service delivery."</p>
<p>The settlement outlined in the Ambulance Service Collective Agreement Act reflects the offer made to the union in September, Falcon said.</p>
<p>The one-year deal is retroactive to April 1, 2009, and includes a competitive compensation increase of three per cent, in line with wage increases for other public-sector workers in 2009.</p>
<p>Paramedics have been on strike since April 1, but are working under an essential-services order from the provincial government.</p>
<p>Negotiations have been strained throughout much of that time.</p>
<p>In September, the president of CUPE local 873 -- the union representing the 3,500 striking paramedics -- told his members the latest contract offer at that time was "repugnant" and "a piece of crap."</p>
<p>"We could never recommend this settlement proposal to our membership," John Strohmaier wrote in late September, calling the offer at that time "woefully short of reasonable expectations."</p>
<p>The announcement came as paramedics were set to create picket lines outside one of the Olympic venues.</p>
<p>In a statement, CUPE 873 said the protest will be set up outside the Olympic Sliding Centre.</p>
<p>The union argues it is unfair to dedicate ambulances and paramedics to the Whistler Sliding Centre for three weeks of practice while many B.C. communities are without any ambulances.</p>
<p>They said that as many as 20 B.C. communities are left with no ambulances on any given day.</p>
<p>Last month, Falcon would not speak directly about potential back-to-work legislation, but stressed a need to resolve the strike.</p>

<p>The H1N1 "epidemic" is an excellent case of creating fear for the sake of fear.</p>
<p>Yes, many people will (and have) become sick and some will die.</p>
<p>However, the death and serious illness rates are far lower than those from normal seasonal flu.</p>
<p>In a normal season, about 4,500 people die in Canada, and not one rates even a tiny mention in the paper. It's a part of life, if you will. Yes, every death is a tragedy for those involved, but headlines like those in The Province and entire sections on the "faces of the epidemic" do not help anyone. They simply feed into the impression that the country is under assault from a deadly scourge.</p>
<p>The hysteria created by the media all contribute to stress, worry, and panic. It's very sad when people die, but people die in hospital every day, in every town. It doesn't merit hyping it as a massive "epidemic."</p>

<p>The completely inept handling of the planning and priority for vaccinating the people of Canada against H1N1 lies squarely at the feet of Federal Minister of Health Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>She has a responsibility to all Canadians to perform her duties with a degree of competence which she does not possess and refuses to enlist necessary help to achieve. Her cabinet selection was obviously based on her gender and her minority status</p>

<p>The news anchor shakes my hand. So glad you could make it," he says. Then he turns, still talking, and presses the nozzle on the hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>This is the new greeting. Howdy, neighbour -- now let me wipe you off.</p>
<p>The current hysteria over the H1N1 flu virus has people so spooked, they don't even wait until you leave the room. They touch you, then untouch you. Connect, disconnect.</p>
<p>"So, have you done many cities?" the news anchor says, vigorously rubbing his hands.</p>
<p>I have done many cities. I am travelling the country on a book tour. And I've been astounded to learn that the thing that most unifies America is not patriotism, faith or even Jon and Kate. It's Purell.</p>
<p>If I could have bought stock in this stuff a year ago, I'd have emptied the bank account. Everywhere I go, there is a jar or a bottle. A plastic spout. A little squirt. Hands wringing back and forth. Suddenly, everyone is a surgeon. Scrub up.</p>
<p>When did we get so paranoid? There have been flus before. There have been viruses before. We didn't turn into a nation of palm rubbers. But we sure have now.</p>
<p>We see germs the way that kid from The Sixth Sense saw dead people. People disinfect in banks. At the office. Remember when Mom used to tell us to wash our hands? Heck, these days we'd steal the Purell out of Mom's protective hands.</p>
<p>What's worse, all this worrying has got me worried. I used to shake hands without hesitation. Hundreds a night sometimes, if I was giving a talk somewhere. Now, suddenly, I see every hand as a glowing green wad of kryptonite. Every sink handle is a germ repository. I see a door and try to open it with my feet. And let's not even talk about the toilet handle. I never trusted that BEFORE the flu.</p>
<p>I'm sitting across from the host in a St. Louis radio station. Between us are two microphones, two cups of water and a pump-top bottle of sanitizer. Suddenly, I can't stop looking at it. The interviewer and I had shaken hands and now I can feel those germs seeping into my bloodstream. I stare at that Purell bottle, wondering whether he's thinking what I'm thinking: "I better get it first, or he'll have his pumping-finger germs all over the spout." I begin to sweat. My sweat makes him suspicious. And sweat has germs! We are locked in a stare down over that white plastic spout. If he makes a move, I'll move faster. If he dives, I'll pounce. It's me or him, survival of the fittest, slime or be slimed.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's my imagination.</p>
<p>But this isn't. Hand sanitizer is the new bottled water. It's the new, expensive version of something we used to get for free, namely, soap and water, or a good wipe on the seat of your pants. Now, nothing counts unless it reads "kills 99.9 per cent of germs." Sales of hand sanitizer reportedly are three times as great as they were last year at this time. I see dispensers in airports. I see dispensers in hotels. It's like the new ATM machine. Spritz, spritz. Squirt, squirt.</p>
<p>Soon they will hit you up for a service charge for every hit on the bottle. Soon soap will be passé. We will shower in Purell. Use Purell instead of cologne. Shampoo with Purell. Condition with it, too.</p>
<p>"Well, great seeing you," the anchor says.</p>
<p>Nice seeing you, I say. I rise. I turn. My hand twitches. His hand twitches. For a moment, that old urge to shake, to make contact, flickers inside us. But the new world takes over. The old ways are gone. We nod at each other. And I wonder, as I walk away, if a nod requires a hit on that Purell bottle.</p>

</p>
<p>Was there ever any doubt the strike by B.C. paramedics would end the way it did yesterday -- with the government legislating ambulance attendants back on the job?</p>
<p>You could see this one coming back in January, when the paramedics demanded a 29-per-cent wage hike at the height of the global economic meltdown.</p>
<p>Talk about lousy timing. That's like marching into your boss's office and asking for a raise on the same day the company declares bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The paramedics' stratospheric wage demand reminded me of 2001, when the B.C. teachers' union demanded a 34-per-cent raise a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks had sent world stock markets into freefall.</p>
<p>And guess how that one ended? The teachers went on strike and the government forced them back to work. You don't have to be the Amazing Kreskin to predict this stuff.</p>
<p>That's not to say paramedics don't work their butts off or that they're not a crucial part of the health-care system or they're not respected and appreciated by the public. Just the opposite is true.</p>
<p>It's just that a major aspect of these sort of disputes is the public-relations battle -- and you don't get much public sympathy by asking for the moon when the economy is on the rocks and thousands of people are out of work. (Ask the 535 people just laid off in Kitimat if a 29-per-cent raise is a reasonable demand.)</p>
<p>And was there ever a genuine chance of a negotiated settlement? When the government offered a three-per-cent raise, the union executive responded in the bluntest of terms.</p>
<p>"The offer of settlement amounts to a piece of crap," CUPE Local 873 president John Strohmaier wrote in his recommendation to union members.</p>
<p>A "piece of crap"? When the economy is flatlining and the annual inflation rate is actually below zero? At some point, there's no sense talking anymore.</p>
<p>The union demanded such a big raise because they wanted to be paid the same as Vancouver police officers, despite the fact that the two jobs are completely different and haven't been in the same wage ballpark since the 1970s.</p>
<p>The bitter irony for the union is it could have settled back in March for a three-per-cent raise and a $4,100 signing bonus. Now the bonus has gone bye-bye, at a time when paramedics could have used the cash.</p>
<p>And by the way: If paramedics are so underpaid at up to $91,000 a year, why are 350 paramedic students trying to train for jobs right now -- training that's been stymied by the strike because the union won't participate in their practicums?</p>
<p>Throw in the H1N1 flu virus, and critical ambulance shortages during the strike, and the government saw the perfect opportunity to bring the hammer down.</p>
<p>CUPE blew it: They should have taken the bonus bucks, like every other public-sector union was smart enough to do.</p>

</p>
<p>A pickup truck full of flowers and hockey-stick-shaped wreaths decorated funeral services Monday for Evan Frustaglio, the 13-year-old Toronto boy who died of H1N1 flu last week.</p>
<p>At a solemn Catholic mass Monday, Evan's father, Paul Frustaglio, delivered a eulogy to his son, a boy he described as his best friend.</p>
<p>"It amazes me that Evan's death has captured a nation trying to find answers to a disease that is currently wearing the face of our beautiful son," said Frustaglio, who stood at the pulpit with his wife, Ann-Marie, and Evan's younger brother, Will, 10.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people attended the service at All Saints Catholic Church. Evan's hockey teammates, classmates, family and friends filled every wooden pew. His teammates wore their jerseys and sat together in the church's front pews, on either side of the family.</p>
<p>Frustaglio wiped away tears as he followed his son's casket into the church and exchanged a look with his wife, as though they knew Evan's life would be widely celebrated.</p>
<p>Nearly 20,000 people have joined a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> memorial page dedicated to the boy.</p>
<p>During the hour-plus service, Rev. Vito Marziliano asked those in attendance to refrain from shaking hands -- a measure that has been introduced at many Canadian churches to discourage the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>Evan's sudden death is credited with putting a human face on the H1N1 virus and prompting people to stand in long lines across the country for the vaccine. Clinics in Toronto opened the day he died.</p>
<p>Evan developed a sore throat and fever during a hockey tournament in London, Ont., where he was playing with his team, the Mississauga North Stars.</p>
<p>He and his mother returned home to Toronto and visited a walk-in clinic, where they were assured he simply had the flu. The following morning, he collapsed at home. His father gave him CPR, but he was pronounced dead at St. Joseph's Health Centre. The robust hockey player had no underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>The family has established two memorial funds at Humber Valley Village School and the Hill Academy, a school for elite athletes that Evan last attended, in honour of their son.</p>

<p>Want to get the H1N1 vaccine? -- phone your family doctor.</p>
<p>That's the advice of Dr. John Carsley, who watched hundreds wait in line yesterday at a flu-shot clinic at Vancouver's Mount Pleasant Community Centre.</p>
<p>"Eighty per cent of the flu vaccine has been distributed to doctors," said Carsley, a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health. "Phone your family doctor to see if they've got the vaccine.</p>
<p>"If so, you can make an appointment instead of waiting in line at a clinic."</p>
<p>A lineup snaked out the door yesterday in Mount Pleasant, with about 75 people waiting in the rain when the clinic opened at noon.</p>
<p>Nikki Hodges had two-year-old Elara in tow yesterday as she waited it out.</p>
<p>"If it had been a two-hour wait, I wouldn't have stayed, but they said it shouldn't be more than an hour or 90 minutes," said Hodges. "She's in daycare, so I want her vaccinated.</p>
<p>"She knows she's getting vaccinated, but she doesn't know what that is."</p>
<p>Possibly the bravest in the queue was Connie Pickett, who brought Ella, 4, and 17-month-old twins Owen and Olivia to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"There's going to be a lot of crying," said Pickett. "I'm worried that Ella is going to bring it home from daycare."</p>
<p>Carsley said parents can rest assured the vaccine has been extensively tested.</p>
<p>"The benefits far outweigh the risks," he said. "Some people get a sore arm or a fever for a day or two -- that's just the vaccine doing its work.</p>
<p>"These vaccines have been extensively tested. Millions and millions of these types of vaccines have been used in Europe."</p>
<p>The clinic offered brochures about the vaccine in English, Chinese, Punjabi, Spanish and Vietnamese. iaustin@theprovince.com</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Virus likely to become seasonal; New strain hasn't peaked and will probably return next winter</b>
</div><div>Lora Grindlay   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>492 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu-infection rate is soaring, and this new strain of influenza will likely become a seasonal variety, a senior health officer said Monday.</p>
<p>"I don't think we've hit the peak of H1N1 yet," said Provincial Health Officer Dr. Perry Kendall.</p>
<p>"All our indicators are still showing increases in infection. We're still seeing it go up. It will come, it will peak, it will go away. Will it come back? I'm pretty sure it will.</p>
<p>"It will certainly be around . . . it will probably become one of the seasonal influenza strains we see." But, even as infection rates climb, the supply of the vaccine in B.C. will be depleted this week and will sharply decline next week.</p>
<p>The province distributed 350,000 doses by last Friday and approximately 350,000 will be given this week. Twenty per cent of the province's population will be vaccinated by the end of the week.</p>
<p>But Kendall said next week's shipment will only be about 63,500 shots.</p>
<p>"It's considerably less. Obviously, receiving this limited amount will constrain our ability to continue to run clinics in that week," he said .</p>
<p>Kendall expects demand for the vaccine to outstrip supply for two weeks if not longer, although everyone who wants a flu shot should be able to get it by Christmas, he said.</p>
<p>"I would ask again that British Columbians be patient and wait their turn to receive the vaccine to allow the most vulnerable to be protected first," he said.</p>
<p>Later this week, the province expects 25,000 doses of the unadjuvanted vaccine to become available to pregnant women. An adjuvant is an additive that makes a drug more efficient. There were early concerns that the adjuvant might be harmful to fetuses. That is no longer thought to be the case.</p>
<p>Kendall said he approved plans to vaccinate 300 people connected with the Olympic Torch Relay before supply problems surfaced.</p>
<p>"Three hundred doses of vaccine for people who would be travelling around the province risking disease, carrying disease to remote and rural communities -- [it] made perfect public-health sense to allocate 300 doses of vaccine to those folks," said Kendall.</p>
<p>He said private clinics in B.C. are not receiving preferential treatment and are being given limited amounts of the vaccine, like any other licensed doctor, "under the condition that it would be distributed free of charge and that it would be made available to those at highest risk first." There have been 12 deaths in B.C. from the H1N1 flu since April. Kendall could not confirm unsubstantiated reports of the death of a B.C. child with H1N1 in recent days.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be surprising," he said. "We have predicted that people will die. Some of them will be young." lgrindlay@theprovince.com</p>

<p>Battlefords Union Hospital cancelled all elective surgeries Monday as the hospital has been struck by an increase of patients and staff with H1N1 flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We had more people needing beds than beds available, and in addition we had some staff call in sick and some of them worked in the OR," said Linda Lewis, Prairie North Health Region spokesperson.</p>
<p>Emergency surgery services have not been affected. The 20 cancelled surgeries will be rescheduled as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Six surgeries scheduled for today were cancelled, but high-priority elective surgeries will be done.</p>

<p>Ten of 55 public schools in Saskatoon have hit the 10 per cent absentee rate among students, a threshold that requires notification to public health officials.</p>
<p>Marion Graham Collegiate is the only high school with the high absentee rate and the rest are elementary schools, though which schools these are is not being released.</p>
<p>Students with H1N1 flu-like symptoms are partly responsible for the high absentee rate, but there are a number of other reasons for missing school, said Saskatoon Public Schools spokesperson Joy Adams Bauer.</p>
<p>Public schools have focused on behavioural changes -- coughing and sneezing into elbows, frequent hand washing, the use of sanitizers, staying home when sick -- to stop the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>Schools will not be closed if absentee rates continue to climb. "Because the virus is in the community, we've been told it's not recommended to close schools," said Adams Bauer.</p>

<p>The first stop on the Margie Lockwood farewell tour was a success.</p>
<p>Lockwood, who will retire this year after 20 years as the co-coach of the Notre Dame Hounds senior girls volleyball team with Bonnie Humphreys, helped lead her team to a Regina High Schools Athletic Association small school title Monday with a 2-0 (25-15, 25-20) win over the Johnson Wildcats at the Centre for Kinesiology, Health and Sport.</p>
<p>"I just volunteer with the team so this it pretty fun," said Lockwood, who works as a nurse. "We won silver here last year and this year it's a gold. It's a really nice way to finish and a nice group of girls.</p>
<p>"The body isn't quite as young as it was to do the hitting at the girls. In volleyball you have to be very active as a coach. I've had a great run."</p>
<p>The Hounds hope they still have a few more stops to make on the tour. Notre Dame plays host to the conference championship on Saturday with the Riverview Royals, Vanier Spirits and Assiniboia Rockets. The top two teams there move on to the regional playdowns, which will spawn the provincial championship representatives.</p>
<p>"We definitely want to do it for her," said Lockwood. "Her daughter (Elaine) is on the team so we want to do our best this year."</p>
<p>The Hounds have had plenty of inspiration guiding them along this season. During the regular season, the team had two games cancelled when five students at the Wilcox school were diagnosed with H1N1 flu and had to be quarantined. As a precaution, the school put all of its athletic events on hold.</p>
<p>"We were the underdog because of the whole swine-flu thing and everybody thought we were going to be quarantined and we were going to lose and our whole team was going to be crap," said Higgs. "We weren't and we knew that we weren't. We knew we were going to win."</p>
<p>The Hounds (5-3) were third in RHSAA league play this season while the Wildcats were first at 8-1.</p>
<p>"It was a really close league this year which was nice," said Lockwood. "There were no gimmes here (Monday)."</p>

<p>In the Nov. 2 edition of the Leader-Post, you displayed pictures of those persons who have died as a result of complications of H1N1. Have your editorial decision-makers fallen on their collective head? How boorish and insensitive!</p>
<p>If Canadian media must borrow the American trash-media approach of "if it bleeds, it leads", why not show post mortem photos of the unfortunate deceased? Shame on the journalist who conceived of this distasteful idea and on the L-P for printing it.</p>

<p>Neither snow, nor rain, nor even H1N1 will keep Saskatchewan's snow plow operators from clearing roadways this winter.</p>
<p>Highways and Infrastructure Minister Jim Reiter is assuring the public that additional staff will be available even if regular snow plow operators fall ill.</p>
<p>"Our ministry staff are prepared and familiar with unforeseen circumstances," Reiter told a news conference Monday morning.</p>
<p>The ministry has about 430 full-time snow plow operators, but can draw upon 122 additional staff if needed.</p>
<p>"There are always emergency plans in place with the Ministry of Highways and this is generally business as usual," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Terry Schmidt, assistant deputy minister, said some seasonal staff, typically employed for summer maintenance, have been given additional training to safely operate a snow plow. They, along with some managers who are also trained to operate snow plows, are available if regular staff fall ill.</p>
<p>The Highway Hotline, which keeps motorists informed of road conditions, also has backup staff available.</p>
<p>Schmidt said the ministry currently has two confirmed cases of H1N1 among equipment operators, who were immediately sent home.</p>
<p>"There is going to be a vaccination program through the Public Service Commission for employees, and we will be encouraging all our employees, especially our front-line employees, to get the vaccination as soon as they can," added Schmidt.</p>
<p>There are more than 300 trucks in 85 winter maintenance sections throughout the province. Highways are prioritized for snow removal and ice treatment based on highway classification and traffic volumes. The highest priority is given to major inter-provincial routes, commuter routes, and highways that connect communities with populations of 3,000 or greater. In those cases, the goal is to have snow plowed from driving lanes within six hours of the end of the storm, although additional time may be needed in extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>If visibility is less than 200 metres, work won't begin until visibility improves.</p>
<p>Legislation known as the "Gallenger Amendment" -- named for snow plow operator Jim Gallenger who was killed while assisting a motorist in a storm in January -- took effect July 1, requiring drivers to slow down to 60 km/h when passing a snow plow either stopped on the side of the road or in operation with warning lights flashing.</p>
<p>Snow plows can operate at speeds as slow as 30 km/h when plowing snow and spreading salt and sand.</p>
<p>Last season plows were outfitted with additional devices to increase visibility, including a rear checkerboard and "wig wag" lights.</p>

<p>Question: Should I stop breastfeeding if I have the H1N1 flu?</p>
<p>Answer: If you are pregnant and start to experience flu-like symptoms, contact your medical health provider right away. Pregnant women are an at-risk population for developing more serious H1N1 illnesses.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says that women who become ill can safely continue to breastfeed their babies. While it isn't known if the flu virus can be passed through breast milk, the benefits of the antibodies in breast milk means it continues to be the best way to keep your baby healthy.</p>
<p>If you are sick, continue to use best infection-control techniques. Wash your hands with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer before touching your child . Cough and sneeze in your arm, not your hand. Keep common surfaces clean and disinfected. If you are healthy and receive the H1N1 vaccine, you can continue to breastfeed after vaccination. Both the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu vaccines are recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women.</p>
<p>- If you have a question about H1N1, send an e-mail to pcowan@leaderpost.canwest.com. We will answer those of the most general interest.</p>

<p>Fear prompted hundreds of Regina parents with infants and pre-schoolers in tow to line up early Monday morning outside the mass immunization clinic at the former Robert Usher Collegiate.</p>
<p>Despite the debate about the vaccine safety and the long line-ups to get into the clinic, parents waiting in line said they weren't taking any chances with their children's health and when its their turn they'll be rolling up their sleeves as well.</p>
<p>"It is controversial I know, but I think I am leaving the decision-making in the hands of the people who know what they are talking about,'' said Regina teacher Tammy Appell.</p>
<p>Appell arrived at the clinic at 6:30 a.m. to get her 22-month old son, Noah, vaccinated. Three hours later they were heading home.</p>
<p>"I was first in the queue and took some ridicule for that one, but that was OK. I was happy to do it to make sure we got the vaccine for Noah.</p>
<p>"I think it is really important because we have positive cases in my work environment and with our kids going to sitters and whatnot and it is so easy to transfer germs."</p>
<p>It was that concern that prompted Amara Geick to don her blue surgical mask as a precaution when she brought her son, Marshall, in to get his shot.</p>
<p>"I wasn't going to wear it, then I thought there are kids here and what if I am sick and I don't know it or what if I get sick and pass it on to my own kid,'' Geick said.</p>
<p>"The doctor said he may or may not have asthma and I don't know yet. So as far as I am concerned that puts him in the high risk group two times. So I think it is pretty important that we be here."</p>
<p>Deanna Isabelle, whose baby is due this week, also wasn't taking any chances with her health, that of her unborn child or her three-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>"I have been staying at home and I haven't been going out," she said.</p>
<p>"I have been really sanitizing the house and not letting people come in just because I am not taking the risk of having our baby die or getting really sick," Isabelle said.</p>
<p>"It is extremely important that I get vaccinated because if I catch H1N1 I could lose the baby and I could die as well.''</p>
<p>Joyce Wilson, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's pandemic mass immunization co-ordinator, told reporters large crowds were expected but she was surprised by the numbers.</p>
<p>"I didn't think they would start lining up that early in the morning especially as it was a coldish day. So we are working as hard and as fast as we can to get them through and out of the cold and on their way again,'' Wilson said.</p>
<p>By 1 p.m. the line-ups were gone, although a steady flow of children and pregnant moms continued to come through the clinic doors.</p>
<p>"People do not need to panic we have enough vaccine for the designated groups for this week,'' Wilson said.</p>
<p>Women more than 20 weeks pregnant, high-risk women less than 20 weeks pregnant and children six months to less than five years of age are eligible to receive the vaccine this week. Clinic hours and locations are posted on the region's website (www.rqhealth.ca[http://www.rqhealth.ca]).</p>

<p>Montreal --</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail's public health reporter, André Picard, tries to clear up the “conflusion” on the H1N1 vaccine and who should get the shot. Mr. Picard has also answered your questions on the the virus (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/h1n1-swine-flu/reader-questions-on-h1n1-answered/article1329448/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/h1n1-swine-flu/reader-questions-on-h1n1-answered/article1329448/]) itself and questions from parents (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/h1n1-swine-flu/a-guide-to-h1n1-for-parents/article1348459/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/h1n1-swine-flu/a-guide-to-h1n1-for-parents/article1348459/]).</p>
<p>Please note that this information is not medical advice. Rather, it is an attempt to synthesize and explain in plain language information from public health officials and medical experts.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a vaccine for H1N1?</p>
<p>A: In Canada, there are actually two versions of H1N1 vaccine: an adjuvanted vaccine that has the brand name Arepanrix and a vaccine without adjuvants. The Public Health Agency of Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses, 1.8 million of them non-adjuvanted. Massive inoculation campaigns are now underway.</p>
<p>Q: There are 34 million Canadians, so why did we order 50 million doses?</p>
<p>A: Fifty million doses is the equivalent of two doses for 75 per cent of the population. Initially, it was believed two doses of the vaccine would be required to produce immunity, and it takes about six months to produce the vaccine. In the interim, research showed that one dose was sufficient to provide immunity. Excess stock will go to developing countries that cannot afford the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: Was the government only planning to immunize 75 per cent of the population?</p>
<p>A: While public health officials say repeatedly that everyone should be immunized, realistically, they know that many (if not most) Canadians will not get immunized. Only about one-third of people get the seasonal flu vaccine and a recent poll showed that approximately the same number plan to get the H1N1 vaccine. In the U.S., however, interest in the vaccine was tepid until a lot of people started getting sick. In and the U.S. were are seeing the same trend: A stampede to vaccine clinics.</p>
<p>Q: The government says six million doses of vaccine were delivered but there seem to be shortages everywhere. Who actually received the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Here is the breakdown of the number of vaccines delivered to each jurisdiction as of Oct. 31. The distribution is roughly per capita, with the exception of employees of the federal government. The provinces and territories (and federal departments) are then responsible for redistributing the product.</p>
<p><pre>Province, Territory or jurisdiction # of vaccines distributed
Newfoundland and Labrador           86,000
Prince Edward Island                29,000
Nova Scotia                         160,000
New Brunswick                       129,000
Quebec                              1,331,000
Ontario                             2,249,500
Manitoba                            206,000
Saskatchewan                        173,000
Alberta                             622,000
British Columbia                    818,000
Nunavut                             22,000
Northwest Territories               34,000
Yukon                               24,000
Foreign Affairs                     15,000
National Defence                    75,500
RCMP                                62,000
</pre>
</p>
<p>Q: In the end, how many Canadians actually received the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: As of mid-December, almost 15 million doses of vaccine had been distributed, meaning about 40 per cent of the population was vaccinated. Canada has one of the highest H1N1 vaccination rates in the world.</p>
<p>Q: Is the flu vaccine free?</p>
<p>A: The H1N1 vaccine is offered to all Canadians free of charge. For seasonal flu, the rules vary from province-to-province. Virtually every province offers the vaccine gratis to members of high-risk groups like seniors, but charge a minimal fee to others. (Those fees are often covered by employers and insurers.)</p>
<p>Q: How does the vaccine work?</p>
<p>A: The vaccine contains antigens that trick the immune system into thinking it is being attacked by the H1N1 virus so it produces antibodies. It takes about a week for immunity to develop after vaccination.</p>
<p>Q: Does that mean I can get the flu from the flu shot?</p>
<p>A: No. The vaccine does not contain live virus so you cannot contract influenza from it.</p>
<p>Q: I really don't like needles. Is there any other way to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>A: In the U.S., some vaccination is done with a nasal spray called FluMist. The product is not (yet) available in Canada.</p>
<p>Q: What's an adjuvant?</p>
<p>A: An adjuvant is a substance used to bolster the antigens in the vaccine; an adjuvant was used in the H1N1 vaccine because of fears that manufacturers would not be able to harvest sufficient stocks from eggs to make antigen. The adjuvanted vaccine, Arepanrix, contains 3.75 micrograms of antigen; the non-adjuvanted version has 15 micrograms of antigen.</p>
<p>Q: What's in the adjuvant?</p>
<p>A: The product from GlaxoSmithKline, Canada's sole provider of H1N1 vaccine, called Arepanrix, uses an adjuvant called AS03, which consists of squalene (shark liver oil), DL-alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and polysorbate 80 (an emulsifier also used in ice cream). There are claims about the dangers of squalene but very little evidence to back them up. For example, it is claimed that the adjuvant used in the anthrax vaccine was to blame for Gulf War syndrome, but there was not adjuvant in that vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: This is a new, experimental vaccine. Has it been properly tested?</p>
<p>A: The H1N1 vaccine is similar to past flu vaccines, which have a good safety record. New versions of the flu vaccine do not require new human trials each year. The controversial aspect of Arepanrix is the adjuvant. While adjuvants have been used in vaccines for some time, AS03 has undergone limited safety testing. Health Canada insists that there have been no shortcuts taken in the approval process for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: What do you mean by limited safety testing?</p>
<p>A: Approximately 45,000 people have received a flu vaccine containing AS03 but that was a vaccine designed to protect against H5N1 (avian influenza) not H1N1. A similar adjuvant, MF59, has been used in about 40 million vaccinations in Europe.</p>
<p>Q: Is H1N1 vaccine safe?</p>
<p>A: Like every drug, the H1N1 vaccine has benefits and risks. The benefit is that it can prevent infection with swine flu – though the protection is not 100 per cent. The risks for most people are minimal, some redness and maybe a slight fever but in rare cases, there can be serious complications like Guillain-Barré syndrome. But those risks are not unique to this vaccine. And bear in mind that vaccines are among the safest drugs on the market.</p>
<p>Q: Isn't there mercury in the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Flu vaccine is packaged in vials that contain multiple doses; to avoid contamination, a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal is added. One dose of vaccine contains about 5 micrograms of mercury; a tuna sandwich contains about 25 micrograms of mercury. There are persistent claims that mercury in vaccines causes autism but this has been debunked.</p>
<p>Q: Should pregnant women get the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Pregnant women, whose immune systems are suppressed, are at high risk of complications from the flu. Therefore, it is recommended that they be the first in line to get the H1N1 vaccine. The H1N1 vaccine that is recommended for pregnant women does not contain adjuvants.</p>
<p>Q: If adjuvants are safe, then why the exception for pregnant women?</p>
<p>A: The short answer is that there is no safety data related to pregnant women, so officials are erring on the side of caution. The World Health Organization says pregnant women should get non-adjuvanted vaccine where possible, but that an adjuvanted vaccine could be used if necessary.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true there is no non-adjuvanted vaccine available? In that case what should a pregnant woman do?</p>
<p>A: The federal government has purchased some non-adjuvanted vaccine from Australia and it is waiting for a Canadian-made version to come out of production in a few weeks. But none is yet available. As the risks are greater for women who are further along in their pregnancy, those in the third trimester should get the adjuvanted vaccine, and as soon as possible. Women in their first and second trimester can choose to wait or get the vaccine that is available now. The risk of adjuvants is theoretical. The risk of the flu is real.</p>
<p>Q: Is there anyone who should not get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A : Anyone with a severe allergy to egg proteins (egg and egg-based products), chicken protein or any of the constituent parts should not get the vaccine. Those other ingredients include thimerosal, sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, and trace amounts of formaldehyde, sodium deoxycholate and sucrose. People with latex allergy should also tell clinic personnel, who often wear latex gloves. People who cannot get the vaccine can take antivirals like Tamiflu as a preventive measure.</p>
<p>Q: Is there an egg-free version of H1N1 available for those with allergies?</p>
<p>A: There is no egg-free version of the vaccine available in Canada.</p>
<p>Q: Does the vaccine offer the same protection to everyone?</p>
<p>A: No, people’s immune systems are not all identical so the body can take varying amounts of time to produce an antibody response. But usually the vaccine will offer protection within a week or so. However, it should be noted that people whose immune system is weak or compromised may not produce as good a response (meaning they have less protection against the H1N1). These include people being treated with chemotherapy for cancer, people with HIV-AIDS, people treated with certain medications.</p>
<p>Q: There is an article in The Atlantic magazine that suggests the H1N1 vaccine doesn’t work. Is that true?</p>
<p>A: The article in The Atlantic (http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911/brownlee-h1n1[http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911/brownlee-h1n1]) underscores an important paradox: Flu vaccines (including H1N1) offer the least protection to those who are most vulnerable to complications – those with chronic health conditions. And they work best in people who are already healthy. Another key question raised by the article is: Does vaccinating everyone actually reduce the death rate? Some research suggests that vaccinating widely reduces the death rate by half; other research suggests the impact on the death rate is virtually nil.</p>
<p>Q: You said earlier that people who take inhaled steroids should not get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: That was an error and the information was removed promptly – though apparently not promptly enough. (This item is updated regularly because information changes.) To be clear: People who take large quantities of inhaled corticosteroids may see have a compromised immune system but they can receive the vaccine, which contains no live virus. People who are immunosuppressed should not take the inhaled version of the vaccine because it contains live virus.</p>
<p>Q: I am allergic to seafood and fish and I read that the vaccine contains shark liver oil. Am I safe?</p>
<p>A: It is recommended that anyone who has had an anaphylactic reaction consult a physician (preferably an allergist) before getting the shot. It would be inappropriate to offer up individual medical advice in an article of this sort, which is designed to provide general information.</p>
<p>Q: Has anyone had an allergic reaction to the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: As of late November, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported 24 cases of severe allergic reaction in people who received the H1N1 vaccine. That is a rate of 0.32 cases of anaphylaxis per 100,000 doses. That is actually lower that the anticipated rate of one case per 100,000. Again, anyone with a severe allergy should notify clinic staff before getting the shot.</p>
<p>Q: I suffer from Crohn's and am taking Humira, which is a powerful immunosuppressant drug. No one wants to stand up and say whether a person with an autoimmune disease like myself should or could have the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>A: It would be irresponsible to answer such a specific question on a general information site like this one. But to repeat earlier answers: The H1N1 vaccine does not contain live virus so it does not pose a risk of disease to those who are immunocompromised; however, people with suppressed immune systems do not always produce a strong response to vaccines, so it may not be as effective.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that the non-adjuvanted vaccine given to pregnant women contains 10 times more mercury (thimerosal)?</p>
<p>A: Yes, the unadjuvanted vaccine does contain 50 micrograms of thimerosal while the adjuvanted vaccine has five micrograms</p>
<p>Q: Is H1N1 vaccine mandatory for anyone like doctors or nurses?</p>
<p>A: No, there is no mandatory influenza vaccination in Canada. However, health professionals are a priority group for getting the vaccine. it has been argued that health-care professionals in particular have a moral duty to get vaccinated (not to mention a practical reason) because they are in regular contact with both patients who have influenza and patients who are at greatest risk of severe complications. Vaccinations rates among health professionals vary wildly among institutions; some have a culture of vaccination and some do not.</p>
<p>Q: Should I get the vaccine if I've already had the flu?</p>
<p>A: If you had a laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1, there is no need to be vaccinated. However, bear in mind that only about one-third of people who say they have had the flu actually had influenza.</p>
<p>Q: What if you are positive you had the H1N1 flu, but it was not confirmed, and you get the shot, -- will there be any side effects.</p>
<p>A: If you have already had H1N1 and you get the vaccine the side effects will be exactly the same as if you never had the disease, meaning you will probably have a bit of soreness at the point of injection. But there is no danger in getting the vaccine if you have already had H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Q: If I get the H1N1 vaccine do I also need to get the seasonal flu vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The jury is still out on that question but the answer is probably. Right now H1N1 is the predominant strain of influenza circulating in Canada so seasonal flu may come along later, or not at all. However, frail seniors, particularly if they are living in an institutional setting, should get the seasonal flu vaccine. Some provinces are offering seasonal flu vaccine at the same time as H1N1; others are not.</p>
<p>Q: How is the seasonal vaccine different from the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The seasonal flu vaccine, brand name Fluviral, contains three strains each year. In 2009-10 those strains are A/Brisbane (H1N1), A/Brisbane (H3N2) and B/Brisbane. Please note that the A/Brisbane (H1N1) is not at all the same as the pandemic strain, which is A/California (H1N1).</p>
<p>Q: I’ve heard that the flu vaccine really hurts. Is that true?</p>
<p>A: It is well documented that vaccines that contain adjuvants hurt more than those that do not. So, yes, you can expect that the H1N1 vaccine will be more painful than seasonal flu vaccine. But remember, the flu itself is a lot more painful.</p>
<p>Q: I read that people who have had the seasonal flu shot are at greater risk of getting H1N1 so shouldn't I avoid the regular flu shot this year?</p>
<p>A: A study did indeed show that, among those infected with H1N1, more had been vaccinated against the seasonal flu in the past than had not. But the past vaccines did not cause them to be more at risk. Rather, it is an association. The reality is that people at highest risk of getting the flu – frail elderly, those with chronic illnesses – are most likely to get the flu shot each year. And they, particularly those with underlying illnesses like chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and asthma, remain at very high risk.</p>
<p>Q: I'm worried about H1N1. Where can I get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The entire stock of H1N1 vaccine was purchased by the federal government and it is being distributed to the provinces. There are clinics around the country and but you need to check with your local health region or provincial telehealth line for details. As you will know from news reports, the lines can be frustratingly long.</p>
<p>Q: Can I avoid the lines by going to my doctor?</p>
<p>A: To date, vaccine has not been distributed to individual physicians in all provinces, though that will likely change. Even in normal circumstances, many doctors do not keep flu vaccine in their offices because it requires refrigeration and a pretty short shelf life. The H1N1 vaccine also needs to be mixed, which is a bother.</p>
<p>Q: You can’t vaccinate all Canadians at the same time. So is there a priority list?</p>
<p>A: It is recommended that the following groups get the vaccine first because they are at higher risk of complications if they get sick:</p>
<p>People under 65 with chronic health conditions; Pregnant women Children aged six months to five years of age; People living in remote and isolated communities, particularly First Nations; Front-line health workers; Care providers to those at high-risk.</p>
<p>Next in line should be:</p>
<p>Children/youth aged 5-18; First responders like firefighters and police; Poultry and swine workers; Adults aged 19-64; Adults 65 and older.</p>
<p>To date, public health officials have politely asked that people respect these priority lists but, with shortages growing worse, the priority lists will likely be enforced more strictly in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Q: If I get the vaccine can I still get the flu?</p>
<p>A: Influenza vaccines are not 100 per cent effective so, yes, it is possible. However, chances are the symptoms will be more mild. Getting the H1N1 vaccine does not mean you will not get sick this winter; there are other strains of flu and numerous other viruses and bacteria that circulate.</p>
<p>Q: I’m pretty sure my daughter has the flu. Can I give her cough syrup?</p>
<p>A: There is very little evidence that over-the-counter cough syrups, cough drops and cold and flu medicines are of any benefit. In children, these products can actually be dangerous. The best treatment for a cough is hydration, so if you are sick sip water and chicken soup.</p>
<p>Q: My child is complaining about achiness – can I give my child Tylenol or baby Aspirin for the pain?</p>
<p>A: Children under the age of 18 should never be given ASA (Aspirin and similar products) because it can cause a rare but deadly condition called Reye’s syndrome. So-called baby Aspirin is not a product for children, it is a low-dose product for adults. Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen) and similar products can be used to treat pain. But recent research has suggested that Tylenol can pose risks to children with asthma and allergies. In all instances, it wise to consult a pediatrician before giving medication – especially a new medication – to a child.</p>
<p>Q: I read that the 13-year-old child who died of H1N1 had taken fever reducers. Are they dangerous?</p>
<p>A: Products like Tylenol, Advil and concoctions that contain these drugs can be used to treat pain and reduce fever. The danger is not necessarily the product per se but that they can mask symptoms and create a false sense of security. Fever, in itself, is not dangerous unless a child’s temperate is extremely high. However, some research suggests that artificially lowering fever can reduce the immune response, prolong illness and actually endanger children. As a result, some countries like Japan, say that fever reducers should never be used in children.</p>
<p>Q: What about babies?</p>
<p>A: Babies under the age of six months should not get the H1N1 vaccine. Some public health officials believe that children under age of three should get non-adjuvanted vaccine. But parents, siblings and caregivers of very young children should get the vaccine to minimize the risk of infecting the baby.</p>
<p>Q: My three-year-old daughter got the flu two weeks ago. The doctor said it was H1N1 but it was not confirmed because the region doesn’t do routine testing. My husband and I did not get sick. How can this be? We took no special precautions. Now we’re wondering: Should we get the vaccine or are we immune to this flu?</p>
<p>A: You have raised several interesting issues related to H1N1 and vaccination. First, about 90 per cent of all the flu cases in Canada today are caused H1N1. There is very little seasonal flu so far. That’s why doctors assume that cases of the flu are H1N1. Testing everyone is not considered a good use of resources.</p>
<p>Second, there is a common assumption that everyone exposed to the H1N1 virus will get the flu. In fact, the large majority of people exposed to the virus will not get sick.</p>
<p>Even though you were in close contact with someone sick with swine flu, healthy young adults like yourselves have powerful immune systems that fight off a constant barrage of pathogens. When you are exposed to a virus, your body will produce antigens and develop immune resistance. In some people, this happens with very few disease symptoms; others will get quite sick. A vaccine does the same thing by tricking the body into thinking it is being exposed the virus.</p>
<p>Many people argue that there is no need to be vaccinated, that we should depend on our immune systems and bolster them with good nutrition. That is a bit of a gamble.</p>
<p>With H1N1, a new strain, it is anticipated that about one-third of the population will get sick. To date, it is estimated that about five per cent of Canadians have fallen ill with H1N1, so a lot more sick people are expected in the coming months.</p>
<p>While it is true that most cases of the flu are “self-limiting” – meaning you get better with rest and fluids, in rare instances people can get gravely ill and die. Again, the risk of complications is greatest in those with weaker immune systems – babies, children, people with chronic health conditions – but some healthy people will get severe illness.</p>
<p>So far in Canada, 1,779 people have been hospitalized with H1N1, including 351 who ended up in intensive care and required ventilators. There have been 92 confirmed deaths.</p>
<p>That is why public health officials recommend that everyone by vaccinated unless they had a laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1. That would include you and your daughter. Even if you have immunity to H1N1, the vaccine will do no harm.</p>
<p>Q: In the online posts, many comments suggest that journalists like yourself are queue-jumpers who use their insider knowledge to get the vaccine. Are you brave enough to answer honestly?</p>
<p>A: I am in the risk category healthy adults aged 18-65. I live in Montreal. I am eligible to receive the H1N1 vaccine after Dec. 7, and so I will get my shot some time after that date. Then I will get my seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: Why aren’t teachers and daycare workers considered “high-priority” for the H1N1 vaccine? Teachers are in daily contact with children (and sick children). Also, many teachers are in their childbearing years and lots of them get pregnant. I don’t understand why teachers aren’t at the front of the line for vaccination.</p>
<p>A: When outbreaks of infectious disease occur, schools and daycare centres are invariably among the places hit first and hardest. Children are virtual microbe-spreading machines and teachers know this well – they tend to get every bug out there. By virtue of being in contact with large groups of children, teachers at relatively high risk of contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>However, the priority groups for vaccination are not those at highest risk of contracting the disease, but those at highest risk of suffering complications and dying if they are infected. This in an important distinction.</p>
<p>The priority groups are:</p>
<p>People under 65 with chronic health conditions; Pregnant women; Children aged six months to five years of age; People living in remote and isolated communities, particularly First Nations; Front-line health workers; Care providers to those at high-risk.</p>
<p>As you can see, pregnant women (including teachers) are a high priority for the vaccine. Some jurisdictions, like Quebec, are also urging all pregnant teachers, daycare workers and health professionals to take “preventive early maternity leave” to lessen their risk of contracting H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Daycare workers who care for children under the age of six months are a high-priority group and should be vaccinated. Daycare workers and teachers of children aged six months to five years, as well as those care for or teach children with chronic health conditions like cystic fibrosis are also considered a high-priority group in most jurisdictions though there are varying interpretations of what the term “care provider to those at high-risk” means.</p>
<p>So, while not all teachers and daycare workers are at the front of the line for vaccination, some of them should be.</p>
<p>Many have wondered why front-line health-care workers are considered high priority and teachers are not. After all, nurses and doctors are not at higher risk of complications and dying if they are infected. There are two reasons: 1) Front-line health-care workers treat a lot of high-risk patients and could put those patients at grave risk if they passed on the flu bug; 2) They are needed to treat people who are sick with the flu (and other conditions), particularly if there is a pandemic that causes widespread illness. Put crudely, a sick nurse would cause a lot more sickness and social disruption than a sick teacher.</p>
<p>Q: There is a lot of talk of the risk of H1N1 to children. Can you tell me how many children have actually died? And were they all healthy? Also, how does that compare to a regular flu season?</p>
<p>A: As of Oct. 24, there have been 100 deaths from H1N1 in Canada, including six deaths in children 15 and under (that is seven per cent of the total). Only one of the children who died had an underlying health condition. By comparison, among adults, 63 per cent of the fatalities have occurred in people with an underlying condition.</p>
<p>In a ‘normal’ flu season, there are roughly 5,000 deaths, most of them seniors. Between three and five children die of seasonal influenza annually (less than 0.1 per cent), and they are usually babies with underdeveloped immune system. Deaths in the six months to 15 age category are very rare.</p>
<p>While every death of a child is tragic, it is also important to keep them in context. The greatest risk to children, by far, is unintentional injuries – motor vehicle crashes, falls, accidental poisoning – which result in almost 400 deaths a year. Another 170 children each year die of cancer. So one of the best ways to keep your child safe is to drive carefully when you head to the vaccination clinic.</p>
<p>Q: There are six priority groups for vaccination, including people under 65 with chronic medical conditions. My wife and I are both over 65; she suffers from COPD and requires oxygen. She gets the flu shot every year because she is considered high-risk. Can you tell my why she is being sent to the back of the line this time? This seems, at best, arbitrary and bureaucratic and, at worst, flagrant discrimination against seniors.</p>
<p>A: In regular flu seasons, seniors (particularly those with lung diseases like COPD) are the high-risk group. However, there is strong evidence that older people (meaning over 50) have full or partial immunity to swine flu. That is because, between 1918 and 1957, H1N1 viruses circulated commonly so most people developed antibodies that seem to protect them against the current strain of H1N1. In other words, seniors are well down the priority list because they stand to get a lot less benefit from the shot than younger people. It should be noted though that some physicians and public health officials believe that all people with respiratory conditions like COPD and asthma should be vaccinated in priority fashion, regardless of age. This is an area of some controversy. While seniors have a lower risk of contracting H1N1, if they do get infected, disease can be very severe. In fact, despite all the attention paid to the deaths of young people, the over-65 group has the highest mortality rate from H1N1 and virtually all seniors who died had underlying health conditions. Finally, don't forget that, even if they are being told to wait for the H1N1 vaccine, it is recommended that seniors get the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Globe readers have a number of questions related to blood donation and transfusion.</p>
<p>Q: I’m a long-time blood donor. Yesterday, I got the flu shot. Can I still give blood?</p>
<p>Q: I’m getting heart surgery next week. I’m wondering if can get swine flu from a transfusion?</p>
<p>Q: If you get the flu, does it stay in your blood? If you give blood will it endanger others?</p>
<p>Q: If I get blood from someone who had the vaccine, will I get the antibodies? I mean, can avoid getting the vaccine myself that way?</p>
<p>A: Yes, you can donate blood after getting flu shot, but Canadian Blood Services recommends that you wait 48 hours before doing so. This is simply an extension of normal policy, where blood donors are asked to flag if they feel unwell after a donation – an indication they may have been infected by a bacterium or a virus. That blood is discarded. Because minor reactions like fever are common after the flu shot, the wait period is a way of ensuring that blood donations are not wasted.</p>
<p>There is no wait period for getting a flu shot after a blood donation and no impact on the efficacy of the vaccine.</p>
<p>You cannot get the flu (H1N1 or seasonal) by giving or receiving blood or blood products. Influenza is a virus spread through the respiratory route; it is not blood-borne.</p>
<p>If you get a blood transfusion from someone who has had the H1N1 vaccine or who has had the flu, you will get some antibodies but it is very unlikely you will get enough to protect you. Besides, getting a vaccine is a lot less trouble than getting a transfusion.</p>
<p>So far, pandemic influenza has not had an appreciable effect on blood donation. But, with the flu becoming more widespread, the plan is to “ramp up” collection and bolster inventory to seven days’ worth from the normal five days’ supply. To do so, CBS needs 120,000 blood donations over the next six weeks.</p>
<p>Getting a needle in your arm is in vogue these days so consider getting a second needle and giving the Gift of Life.</p>
<p>Q: There’s a lot of talk about queue-jumping so I would like to know if the Prime Minister and other senior officials received priority access to the H1N1 shot?</p>
<p>A: Stephen Harper has said he will get the shot. The PM has asthma and was eligible to get the vaccine on a priority basis but he has opted to wait and get it at the same time as others in his lower-priority age group.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said her one-year-old baby, who is in a high-risk group, has been vaccinated but she is waiting her turn.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, the man who, in a $3.5-million ad campaign, has been relentlessly urging Canadians to get vaccinated and wash their hands, has not yet been vaccinated either. The chief public health officer of Canada, who suffers from both asthma and an immune condition, was going to get his H1N1 vaccine early on to set an example but, because of media reports of shortages, long waits and queue-jumping, he too opted to wait.</p>
<p>Q: My husband and I are heading to Florida in a couple of days, where we plan to spend the winter. I’m wondering if Snowbirds can get vaccinated before going south?</p>
<p>Q: I’m a frequent flyer. It seems that every day I’m on a plane with someone who is hacking and coughing. I really don’t want to get the flu and spread it to others. Public health says I can’t get the vaccine for a couple of more weeks. Doesn’t it make sense to vaccinate people like me sooner?</p>
<p>A: Being trapped on a plane for several hours with the modern-day version of Typhoid Mary is certainly no fun. But there are no special provisions to provide early vaccination to Snowbirds and frequent flyers. Remember, those given high priority are those most likely to suffer serious complications if they are infected with H1N1 influenza, not those who are most likely to actually catch the bug.</p>
<p>Public health officials are urging those who are sick to avoid mass transit, and calling on carriers to be flexible (read: no punitive charges) in allowing them to delay their travel.</p>
<p>The good news is that some jurisdictions – particularly those outside large urban centres – are vaccinating priority groups more quickly than they had anticipated so the shot will soon be available to everyone. So check with your local public health authorities before heading south.</p>
<p>Today, we have several questions related to pregnancy and babies:</p>
<p>Q: I am eight months pregnant and I have been vaccinated against H1N1. What I want to know is: Will my baby have antibodies when she is born?</p>
<p>A: Flu studies done in the past show that when pregnant women get flu shots before giving birth, they pass on immunity to their child. The baby may not have 100 per cent immunity but even partial protection can be helpful during the infants first few months of life.</p>
<p>Q: My baby is two months old and can’t be vaccinated. But I’m breastfeeding – will that protect him? (I got the adjuvanted vaccine myself because my doctor said it was safe to get while breastfeeding.)</p>
<p>A: Breastfeeding has many advantages. Breastfed children are generally healthier, which offers some protection against infection with pathogens like the H1N1 virus. Moms can also pass on some immunity to the baby in their breast milk. Finally, breastfeeding mothers themselves tend to have stronger immune systems; this reduces the chance of a contracting the flu and passing it on to her infant. And, you are correct, the vaccine is recommended for breastfeeding Moms, and if they have very young babies they are at the top of the priority list.</p>
<p>Q: We have a newborn. My husband, my other children and myself have all been vaccinated. But lots of people aren’t vaccinated so should we keep the baby out of public places just to be safe?</p>
<p>A: A key message that public health officials have tried to convey is that while H1N1 poses a risk, that risk should be kept in context and life must go on. The large majority of people – including babies – will not get sick from the flu and only a tiny minority will get gravely ill or die. While you should not deliberately put your baby in harm’s way, trying to hide away (or quarantine) the baby will not substantially reduce risk and will probably be a huge inconvenience to the family.</p>
<p>Q: I am not pregnant, but I’m trying to get pregnant. Should I get the non-adjuvanted vaccine just to be safe?</p>
<p>A: The recommendation is that pregnant women receive the non-adjuvanted vaccine. Currently, there are no provisions to provide the non-adjuvanted vaccine to others. However, by week’s end, more than one million doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine will be available – far more than there are pregnant women, so there may be some latitude. (After the queue-jumping scandals though, don’t expect clinics to stray at all from the rules. Try and raise your specific situation with an individual physician.) Public health officials, for their part, say that it is vaccination that it is important, regardless of whether you receive the adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted version. This is particularly true for pregnant women – and those trying to get pregnant – because flu symptoms (especially fever) can trigger miscarriages and injure the fetus.</p>
<p>Q: Why is the vaccine not considered safe for children under 6 months and what magically happens at 6 months to make it safe?</p>
<p>A: The issue is not safety, it is efficiency. Children under the age of six months do not have fully developed immune systems so they do not produce a good immune response to the vaccine. That is why it is recommended that caregivers and close contacts of young babies – parents, siblings, daycare workers – be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Today, we a number of questions related to legal liability and vaccination:</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that I can’t sue if the swine flu vaccine makes me sick or kills me?</p>
<p>Q: I’ve read some pretty frightening things about vaccines on the Internet. How many people do they actually kill?</p>
<p>Q: I read that in the U.S. vaccine makers can’t be sued. Is that true in Canada too?</p>
<p>Q: Why have the vaccine producers been given blanket immunity shielding them from any adverse reaction lawsuits?</p>
<p>Q: When I got the H1N1 vaccine, I had to sign a waiver that said I couldn’t sue. Is that valid?</p>
<p>A: In the U.S., federal legislation has, since the 1980s, protected vaccine makers against lawsuits related to childhood vaccines. In July, that protection was extended to makers of H1N1 vaccine. This was done because, in the litigious U.S., drug companies had essentially threatened to stop producing childhood vaccines, which are not particularly profitable and there were fears that production of the flu vaccine would be delayed by legal concerns.</p>
<p>The inability to sue manufacturers does not mean those who are vaccine-damaged cannot receive compensation. The U.S. has a “vaccine court” that hears cases and awards compensation.</p>
<p>In Canada, vaccine manufacturers do not have blanket protection from lawsuits and suits related to harm caused by vaccine are usually settled out-of-court. One province, Quebec, has a no-fault insurance program that operates in a manner similar to the U.S. vaccine court. Over two decades, there have been about 100 claims and a couple of dozen substantial awards.</p>
<p>The Canadian Paediatric Society estimates that about five children a year will potentially suffer a serious adverse event from vaccination. Bear in mind that there are almost 400,000 children born a year and they get approximately two dozen shots by the time they hit kindergarten.</p>
<p>Health officials describe the number of severe adverse reactions to influenza vaccines as “very rare.” The biggest danger is a life-threatening allergic reaction to a component of the vaccine such as egg proteins. In rare instances – again, numbers are hard to come by – a person can suffer from Guillain-Barré syndrome after vaccination. The autoimmune condition, which is characterized by paralysis that can be reversed, is related to fever. The disastrous 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign was derailed by reports of numerous cases of Guillain-Barré. But infectious disease experts note that the flu itself triggers far more cases of Guillain-Barré than the vaccine.</p>
<p>On the question of “immunity” from H1N1 vaccine lawsuits (a clever play on words), the reality is a bit more complex. In the contract between the government of Canada and GlaxoSmithKline, Ottawa promises to “indemnify” anyone harmed by the vaccine. Practically, what this means is that, if you suffer harm from the vaccine, you can sue and the government, not GSK, will be responsible for paying the settlement.</p>
<p>Many have argued that this is an unnecessary gift to a big, wealthy pharmaceutical company. But the underlying philosophy – as articulated in a landmark 1985 Supreme Court judgment - is that people exposed to a potential harm while undergoing an intervention that is in the greater public good, particularly at the urging of the state, should be compensated by the state if they are harmed in the process.</p>
<p>Finally, when you get a H1N1 vaccine you will be asked to sign a waiver. The wording of these waivers varies a lot across the country but most say that you waive the right to sue those administering the vaccine – principally nurses. Lawyers consulted said that these waivers would in no way limit your ability to sue the vaccine maker of the government.</p>
<p>Q: Is the non-adjuvanted vaccine available now for pregnant women? And can we get non-adjuvanted vaccine for our kids too?</p>
<p>A: By week’s end (Nov. 10) one million doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine have been distributed to the provinces and territories. However, the vaccine, called Panvax, has not yet been approved by Health Canada. Approval is imminent so the vaccine should be available to any pregnant woman who asks by week’s end.</p>
<p>The formal recommendation is that only pregnant women get the non-adjuvanted form of the vaccine. But some parents have safety concerns because there has been limited testing of the adjuvant, particularly in younger children.</p>
<p>So the question becomes: Should you demand the non-adjuvanted vaccine?</p>
<p>The vast majority of pediatricians and public health officials will tell you that the adjuvanted vaccine is safe and that it actually works better than the non-adjuvanted vaccine – meaning it generates a better immune response, including in children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>But if you insist, will you be able to get non-adjuvanted vaccine for your child? Currently, the answer is: Probably not. Most vaccinations are being done in clinics and, after a series of queue-jumping scandals, the recommendations are being followed to the letter. Individual physicians have more freedom to provide non-adjuvanted vaccine to patients but they have been supplied with very little of that product.</p>
<p>Q: Our three girls (ages 2, 2, and 4) have been vaccinated. We were told at the clinic a half-dose was provided and to return in three weeks for the other half-dose. But then I heard on that radio that a second shot was no longer required. Can you help clear up this confusion?</p>
<p>A: The current recommendation is that children aged six months to nine years should receive the adjuvanted vaccine in two half-doses, administered 21 days apart. But the World Health Organization said last week that one half-dose provides a sufficient immune response to protect children from H1N1. The Canadian policy is currently being reviewed. Practically, the focus now is getting all children vaccinated once and, within the next couple of weeks, it will likely be announced that young children don’t need a second shot – a rare bit of good flu news for parents. For the seasonal flu, it is still recommended that children aged six months to nine years get the vaccine in two shots, at least 28 days apart.</p>
<p>Everyone 10 and over requires only one shot of H1N1 vaccine and one shot of seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: How will we know when the pandemic is over?</p>
<p>A: Influenza spreads in a well-established and predictable manner: The number of cases increases in an accelerating manner until it reaches a peak, and then the number of new cases gradually falls off. Public health officials will know that peak has been reached when they start to see a decrease in the number of new cases. In Canada, the peak of H1N1 influenza was reached the week of Nov. 24.</p>
<p>Q: There have been two waves of H1N1. Will there be a third wave?</p>
<p>A: The “third wave” theory is a point of much debate among public health officials. While it is possible that there could be a resurgence of H1N1 flu in the New Year – after all the flu usually peaks in January – it is unlikely. Why? Because, to date, about 40 per cent of Canadians have been vaccinated and another 10-15 per cent of the population has likely been infected. That means only about one-third of the population is at risk of contracting H1N1, so large outbreaks are not likely. However, one can expect to see a fair bit of seasonal flu early in 2010.</p>
<p>Q: In the end, how many people actually died of H1N1?</p>
<p>A: As of Dec. 19, there were 401 confirmed deaths from H1N1. A total of 1,404 Canadian were admitted to intensive care units for treatment of the swine flu; some of them will have life-long disabilities as a result. There were also 8,436 people whose flu symptoms were so severe that they required hospitalization. The most noteworthy characteristic of H1N1 was how it disproportionately affected younger people. For example, while influenza usually affects seniors, the median age of those hospitalized with H1N1 was only 28 and the median age of those who died was 53.</p>
<p>Q: When you look back were the people in the priority groups for vaccination more at risk?</p>
<p>A: According to the latest data – mid-December – those with underlying medical conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis suffered the brunt of the H1N1 epidemic. More than half of people who were hospitalized and three-quarters of the deaths occurred among those with underlying conditions that placed them at high-risk. Similarly, one in five hospitalizations and one in 12 deaths occurred among pregnant women. Finally, about seven per cent of hospitalizations and deaths were in aboriginal people while they make up only about one per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Q: How much is the “largest immunization campaign in Canadian history” costing us, the taxpayers?</p>
<p>A: The vaccine costs about $8 a dose, so the total cost is about $400-million. Far more costly though is the cost of administering and publicizing the vaccine in the hundreds of clinic sites around the country; as of mid-November, that cost had reached about $1.5-billion. So, when all is said and done, the H1N1 campaign will cost well in excess of $2-billion. The federal government is picking up 60 per cent of the tab and the provinces are on the hook for the other 40 per cent.</p>
<p>Q: Who can I call if I have more questions?</p>
<p>A: The Public Health Agency of Canada has a H1N1 hotline 1-800454-8302. Most provinces and health regions also have telehealth lines that you can call for information, including where to get a flu shot.</p>

<p>Montreal --</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has begun to spread in earnest and the high-profile death of a 13-year-old Toronto boy has awakened the public to the potential dangers of the virus.</p>
<p>Many parents are worried and looking for clear information about the flu and how to treat it. The Globe and Mail's public health reporter, André Picard, tries to clear up the “conflusion” by answering reader questions. Mr. Picard has also answered your questions on thevaccineandthe virus.</p>
<p>Please note that this information is not medical advice. Rather, it is an attempt to synthesize and explain in plain language information from public health officials and medical experts.</p>
<p>Q: I’m pretty sure my daughter has the flu. Can I give her cough syrup?</p>
<p>A: There is very little evidence that over-the-counter cough syrups, cough drops and cold and flu medicines are of any benefit. In children, these products can actually be dangerous. The best treatment for a cough is hydration, so if you are sick sip water and chicken soup.</p>
<p>Q: My child is complaining about achiness – can I give my child Tylenol or baby Aspirin for the pain?</p>
<p>A: Children under the age of 18 should never be given ASA (Aspirin and similar products) because it can cause a rare but deadly condition called Reye’s syndrome. So-called baby Aspirin is not a product for children, it is a low-dose product for adults. Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen) and similar products can be used to treat pain. But recent research has suggested that Tylenol can pose risks to children with asthma and allergies. In all instances, it wise to consult a pediatrician before giving medication – especially a new medication – to a child.</p>
<p>Q: I read that the 13-year-old child who died of H1N1 had taken fever reducers. Are they dangerous?</p>
<p>A: Products like Tylenol, Advil and concoctions that contain these drugs can be used to treat pain and reduce fever. The danger is not necessarily the product per se but that they can mask symptoms and create a false sense of security. Fever, in itself, is not dangerous unless a child’s temperate is extremely high. However, some research suggests that artificially lowering fever can reduce the immune response, prolong illness and actually endanger children. As a result, some countries like Japan, say that fever reducers should never be used in children.</p>
<p>Q: What about babies?</p>
<p>A: Babies under the age of six months should not get the H1N1 vaccine. Some public health officials believe that children under age of three should get non-adjuvanted vaccine. But parents, siblings and caregivers of very young children should get the vaccine to minimize the risk of infecting the baby.</p>
<p>Q: Should older children get the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The vaccine is recommended for all Canadians over the age of six months, with few exceptions. However, it is recommended that children under the age of 10 get the vaccine in two half-doses, three weeks apart, instead of a single dose. The two-shot process is used because children do not produce as strong an immune response to the antigen as adults do.</p>
<p>Q: My son is five so he is supposed to get two shots, at least three weeks apart and then it takes time for the vaccine to work. Does that mean he won’t be protected for at least a month?</p>
<p>A: Currently it is recommended that children under 10 get two half-doses at least three weeks apart. However, the body will start producing antibodies immediately to the vaccine should confer partial protection. There is also growing evidence that only one shot is needed for children.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that children only need one shot, not two?</p>
<p>A: An expert committee of the World Health Organization has revised its earlier recommendation and said that one shot of the vaccine is adequate for children. The Public Health Agency of Canada said it is reviewing the matter. In the meantime, get that first shot.</p>
<p>Q: Is there anyone who should not get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A : Anyone with a severe allergy to egg proteins (egg and egg-based products), chicken protein or any of the constituent parts should not get the vaccine. Those other ingredients include thimerosal, sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, and trace amounts of formaldehyde, sodium deoxycholate and sucrose. People with latex allergy should also tell clinic personnel, who often wear latex gloves. People who cannot get the vaccine can take antivirals like Tamiflu as a preventive measure.</p>
<p>Q: Is there an egg-free version of H1N1 available for those with allergies?</p>
<p>A: There is no egg-free version of the vaccine available in Canada.</p>
<p>Q: So children with asthma and who use an inhaler can get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Children with asthma – many of who use inhalers that contain steroids - are a priority group for vaccination because, if they contract the H1N1 virus, they are at higher risk of complications. But bear in mind that many children with asthma also have allergies, so check the list of potential allergens (see above.)</p>
<p>Q: If people can infect others before they get sick and after they get better shouldn’t we all stay home?</p>
<p>A: It is true that people can infect others when they have no visible or audible symptoms. But the reality is that they are far more likely to spread the virus when they are sick because of the coughing, runny nose and so on.</p>
<p>Q: It seems like there are a lot of kids with the flu. Why is that?</p>
<p>A: There’s a certain predictable rhythm to the spread of the flu in communities each year: First you see spread among children (who are often in large groups and have slightly less developed immune systems), then it moves to older people. Usually, that is seniors but with H1N1 it is the 15-50 age group. When flu is widespread in children, you start to see an increase in hospitalizations a week or two later. Then sadly, you see a peak in death two or three weeks afterwards.</p>
<p>Q: Who can I call if I have more questions?</p>
<p>A: The Public Health Agency of Canada has a H1N1 hotline 1-800-454-8302. Most provinces and health regions also have telehealth lines that you can call for information, including where to get a flu shot.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal --</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail's public health reporter, Andr? Picard, tries to clear up the “conflusion” on the H1N1 vaccine and who should get the shot. Mr. Picard has also answered your questions on thethe virus itself and questions from parents.</p>
<p>Please note that this information is not medical advice. Rather, it is an attempt to synthesize and explain in plain language information from public health officials and medical experts.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a vaccine for H1N1?</p>
<p>A: In Canada, there are actually two versions of H1N1 vaccine: an adjuvanted vaccine that has the brand name Arepanrix and a vaccine without adjuvants. The Public Health Agency of Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses, 1.8 million of them non-adjuvanted. Massive inoculation campaigns are now underway.</p>
<p>Q: There are 34 million Canadians, so why did we order 50 million doses?</p>
<p>A: Fifty million doses is the equivalent of two doses for 75 per cent of the population. Initially, it was believed two doses of the vaccine would be required to produce immunity, and it takes about six months to produce the vaccine. In the interim, research showed that one dose was sufficient to provide immunity. Excess stock will go to developing countries that cannot afford the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: Was the government only planning to immunize 75 per cent of the population?</p>
<p>A: While public health officials say repeatedly that everyone should be immunized, realistically, they know that many (if not most) Canadians will not get immunized. Only about one-third of people get the seasonal flu vaccine and a recent poll showed that approximately the same number plan to get the H1N1 vaccine. In the U.S., however, interest in the vaccine was tepid until a lot of people started getting sick. In and the U.S. were are seeing the same trend: A stampede to vaccine clinics.</p>
<p>Q: The government says six million doses of vaccine were delivered but there seem to be shortages everywhere. Who actually received the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Here is the breakdown of the number of vaccines delivered to each jurisdiction as of Oct. 31. The distribution is roughly per capita, with the exception of employees of the federal government. The provinces and territories (and federal departments) are then responsible for redistributing the product.</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador : 86,000</p>
<p>Prince Edward Island : 29,000</p>
<p>Nova Scotia: 160,000</p>
<p>New Brunswick : 129,000</p>
<p>Quebec: 1,331,000</p>
<p>Ontario: 2,249,500</p>
<p>Manitoba: 206,000</p>
<p>Saskatchewan : 173,000</p>
<p>Alberta: 622,000</p>
<p>British Columbia: 818,000</p>
<p>Nunavut: 22,000</p>
<p>Northwest Territories: 34,000</p>
<p>Yukon: 24,000</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs: 15,000</p>
<p>National Defence: 75,500</p>
<p>RCMP: 62,000</p>
<p>Q: In the end, how many Canadians actually received the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: As of mid-December, almost 15 million doses of vaccine had been distributed, meaning about 40 per cent of the population was vaccinated. Canada has one of the highest H1N1 vaccination rates in the world.</p>
<p>Q: Is the flu vaccine free?</p>
<p>A: The H1N1 vaccine is offered to all Canadians free of charge. For seasonal flu, the rules vary from province-to-province. Virtually every province offers the vaccine gratis to members of high-risk groups like seniors, but charge a minimal fee to others. (Those fees are often covered by employers and insurers.)</p>
<p>Q: How does the vaccine work?</p>
<p>A: The vaccine contains antigens that trick the immune system into thinking it is being attacked by the H1N1 virus so it produces antibodies. It takes about a week for immunity to develop after vaccination.</p>
<p>Q: Does that mean I can get the flu from the flu shot?</p>
<p>A: No. The vaccine does not contain live virus so you cannot contract influenza from it.</p>
<p>Q: I really don't like needles. Is there any other way to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>A: In the U.S., some vaccination is done with a nasal spray called FluMist. The product is not (yet) available in Canada.</p>
<p>Q: What's an adjuvant?</p>
<p>A: An adjuvant is a substance used to bolster the antigens in the vaccine; an adjuvant was used in the H1N1 vaccine because of fears that manufacturers would not be able to harvest sufficient stocks from eggs to make antigen. The adjuvanted vaccine, Arepanrix, contains 3.75 micrograms of antigen; the non-adjuvanted version has 15 micrograms of antigen.</p>
<p>Q: What's in the adjuvant?</p>
<p>A: The product from GlaxoSmithKline, Canada's sole provider of H1N1 vaccine, called Arepanrix, uses an adjuvant called AS03, which consists of squalene (shark liver oil), DL-alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and polysorbate 80 (an emulsifier also used in ice cream). There are claims about the dangers of squalene but very little evidence to back them up. For example, it is claimed that the adjuvant used in the anthrax vaccine was to blame for Gulf War syndrome, but there was not adjuvant in that vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: This is a new, experimental vaccine. Has it been properly tested?</p>
<p>A: The H1N1 vaccine is similar to past flu vaccines, which have a good safety record. New versions of the flu vaccine do not require new human trials each year. The controversial aspect of Arepanrix is the adjuvant. While adjuvants have been used in vaccines for some time, AS03 has undergone limited safety testing. Health Canada insists that there have been no shortcuts taken in the approval process for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: What do you mean by limited safety testing?</p>
<p>A: Approximately 45,000 people have received a flu vaccine containing AS03 but that was a vaccine designed to protect against H5N1 (avian influenza) not H1N1. A similar adjuvant, MF59, has been used in about 40 million vaccinations in Europe.</p>
<p>Q: Is H1N1 vaccine safe?</p>
<p>A: Like every drug, the H1N1 vaccine has benefits and risks. The benefit is that it can prevent infection with swine flu – though the protection is not 100 per cent. The risks for most people are minimal, some redness and maybe a slight fever but in rare cases, there can be serious complications like Guillain-Barr? syndrome. But those risks are not unique to this vaccine. And bear in mind that vaccines are among the safest drugs on the market.</p>
<p>Q: Isn't there mercury in the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Flu vaccine is packaged in vials that contain multiple doses; to avoid contamination, a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal is added. One dose of vaccine contains about 5 micrograms of mercury; a tuna sandwich contains about 25 micrograms of mercury. There are persistent claims that mercury in vaccines causes autism but this has been debunked.</p>
<p>Q: Should pregnant women get the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: Pregnant women, whose immune systems are suppressed, are at high risk of complications from the flu. Therefore, it is recommended that they be the first in line to get the H1N1 vaccine. The H1N1 vaccine that is recommended for pregnant women does not contain adjuvants.</p>
<p>Q: If adjuvants are safe, then why the exception for pregnant women?</p>
<p>A: The short answer is that there is no safety data related to pregnant women, so officials are erring on the side of caution. The World Health Organization says pregnant women should get non-adjuvanted vaccine where possible, but that an adjuvanted vaccine could be used if necessary.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true there is no non-adjuvanted vaccine available? In that case what should a pregnant woman do?</p>
<p>A: The federal government has purchased some non-adjuvanted vaccine from Australia and it is waiting for a Canadian-made version to come out of production in a few weeks. But none is yet available. As the risks are greater for women who are further along in their pregnancy, those in the third trimester should get the adjuvanted vaccine, and as soon as possible. Women in their first and second trimester can choose to wait or get the vaccine that is available now. The risk of adjuvants is theoretical. The risk of the flu is real.</p>
<p>Q: Is there anyone who should not get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A : Anyone with a severe allergy to egg proteins (egg and egg-based products), chicken protein or any of the constituent parts should not get the vaccine. Those other ingredients include thimerosal, sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, and trace amounts of formaldehyde, sodium deoxycholate and sucrose. People with latex allergy should also tell clinic personnel, who often wear latex gloves. People who cannot get the vaccine can take antivirals like Tamiflu as a preventive measure.</p>
<p>Q: Is there an egg-free version of H1N1 available for those with allergies?</p>
<p>A: There is no egg-free version of the vaccine available in Canada.</p>
<p>Q: Does the vaccine offer the same protection to everyone?</p>
<p>A: No, people’s immune systems are not all identical so the body can take varying amounts of time to produce an antibody response. But usually the vaccine will offer protection within a week or so. However, it should be noted that people whose immune system is weak or compromised may not produce as good a response (meaning they have less protection against the H1N1). These include people being treated with chemotherapy for cancer, people with HIV-AIDS, people treated with certain medications.</p>
<p>Q: There is an article in The Atlantic magazine that suggests the H1N1 vaccine doesn’t work. Is that true?</p>
<p>A: The article in The Atlantic underscores an important paradox: Flu vaccines (including H1N1) offer the least protection to those who are most vulnerable to complications – those with chronic health conditions. And they work best in people who are already healthy. Another key question raised by the article is: Does vaccinating everyone actually reduce the death rate? Some research suggests that vaccinating widely reduces the death rate by half; other research suggests the impact on the death rate is virtually nil.</p>
<p>Q: You said earlier that people who take inhaled steroids should not get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: That was an error and the information was removed promptly – though apparently not promptly enough. (This item is updated regularly because information changes.) To be clear: People who take large quantities of inhaled corticosteroids may see have a compromised immune system but they can receive the vaccine, which contains no live virus. People who are immunosuppressed should not take the inhaled version of the vaccine because it contains live virus.</p>
<p>Q: I am allergic to seafood and fish and I read that the vaccine contains shark liver oil. Am I safe?</p>
<p>A: It is recommended that anyone who has had an anaphylactic reaction consult a physician (preferably an allergist) before getting the shot. It would be inappropriate to offer up individual medical advice in an article of this sort, which is designed to provide general information.</p>
<p>Q: Has anyone had an allergic reaction to the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: As of late November, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported 24 cases of severe allergic reaction in people who received the H1N1 vaccine. That is a rate of 0.32 cases of anaphylaxis per 100,000 doses. That is actually lower that the anticipated rate of one case per 100,000. Again, anyone with a severe allergy should notify clinic staff before getting the shot.</p>
<p>Q: I suffer from Crohn's and am taking Humira, which is a powerful immunosuppressant drug. No one wants to stand up and say whether a person with an autoimmune disease like myself should or could have the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>A: It would be irresponsible to answer such a specific question on a general information site like this one. But to repeat earlier answers: The H1N1 vaccine does not contain live virus so it does not pose a risk of disease to those who are immunocompromised; however, people with suppressed immune systems do not always produce a strong response to vaccines, so it may not be as effective.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that the non-adjuvanted vaccine given to pregnant women contains 10 times more mercury (thimerosal)?</p>
<p>A: Yes, the unadjuvanted vaccine does contain 50 micrograms of thimerosal while the adjuvanted vaccine has five micrograms</p>
<p>Q: Is H1N1 vaccine mandatory for anyone like doctors or nurses?</p>
<p>A: No, there is no mandatory influenza vaccination in Canada. However, health professionals are a priority group for getting the vaccine. it has been argued that health-care professionals in particular have a moral duty to get vaccinated (not to mention a practical reason) because they are in regular contact with both patients who have influenza and patients who are at greatest risk of severe complications. Vaccinations rates among health professionals vary wildly among institutions; some have a culture of vaccination and some do not.</p>
<p>Q: Should I get the vaccine if I've already had the flu?</p>
<p>A: If you had a laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1, there is no need to be vaccinated. However, bear in mind that only about one-third of people who say they have had the flu actually had influenza.</p>
<p>Q: What if you are positive you had the H1N1 flu, but it was not confirmed, and you get the shot, -- will there be any side effects.</p>
<p>A: If you have already had H1N1 and you get the vaccine the side effects will be exactly the same as if you never had the disease, meaning you will probably have a bit of soreness at the point of injection. But there is no danger in getting the vaccine if you have already had H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Q: If I get the H1N1 vaccine do I also need to get the seasonal flu vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The jury is still out on that question but the answer is probably. Right now H1N1 is the predominant strain of influenza circulating in Canada so seasonal flu may come along later, or not at all. However, frail seniors, particularly if they are living in an institutional setting, should get the seasonal flu vaccine. Some provinces are offering seasonal flu vaccine at the same time as H1N1; others are not.</p>
<p>Q: How is the seasonal vaccine different from the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The seasonal flu vaccine, brand name Fluviral, contains three strains each year. In 2009-10 those strains are A/Brisbane (H1N1), A/Brisbane (H3N2) and B/Brisbane. Please note that the A/Brisbane (H1N1) is not at all the same as the pandemic strain, which is A/California (H1N1).</p>
<p>Q: I’ve heard that the flu vaccine really hurts. Is that true?</p>
<p>A: It is well documented that vaccines that contain adjuvants hurt more than those that do not. So, yes, you can expect that the H1N1 vaccine will be more painful than seasonal flu vaccine. But remember, the flu itself is a lot more painful.</p>
<p>Q: I read that people who have had the seasonal flu shot are at greater risk of getting H1N1 so shouldn't I avoid the regular flu shot this year?</p>
<p>A: A study did indeed show that, among those infected with H1N1, more had been vaccinated against the seasonal flu in the past than had not. But the past vaccines did not cause them to be more at risk. Rather, it is an association. The reality is that people at highest risk of getting the flu – frail elderly, those with chronic illnesses – are most likely to get the flu shot each year. And they, particularly those with underlying illnesses like chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and asthma, remain at very high risk.</p>
<p>Q: I'm worried about H1N1. Where can I get the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The entire stock of H1N1 vaccine was purchased by the federal government and it is being distributed to the provinces. There are clinics around the country and but you need to check with your local health region or provincial telehealth line for details. As you will know from news reports, the lines can be frustratingly long.</p>
<p>Q: Can I avoid the lines by going to my doctor?</p>
<p>A: To date, vaccine has not been distributed to individual physicians in all provinces, though that will likely change. Even in normal circumstances, many doctors do not keep flu vaccine in their offices because it requires refrigeration and a pretty short shelf life. The H1N1 vaccine also needs to be mixed, which is a bother.</p>
<p>Q: You can’t vaccinate all Canadians at the same time. So is there a priority list?</p>
<p>A: It is recommended that the following groups get the vaccine first because they are at higher risk of complications if they get sick:</p>
<p>- People under 65 with chronic health conditions;</p>
<p>- Pregnant women</p>
<p>- Children aged six months to five years of age;</p>
<p>- People living in remote and isolated communities, particularly First Nations;</p>
<p>- Front-line health workers;</p>
<p>- Care providers to those at high-risk.</p>
<p>Next in line should be:</p>
<p>- Children/youth aged 5-18;</p>
<p>- First responders like firefighters and police;</p>
<p>- Poultry and swine workers;</p>
<p>- Adults aged 19-64;</p>
<p>- Adults 65 and older.</p>
<p>To date, public health officials have politely asked that people respect these priority lists but, with shortages growing worse, the priority lists will likely be enforced more strictly in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Q: If I get the vaccine can I still get the flu?</p>
<p>A: Influenza vaccines are not 100 per cent effective so, yes, it is possible. However, chances are the symptoms will be more mild. Getting the H1N1 vaccine does not mean you will not get sick this winter; there are other strains of flu and numerous other viruses and bacteria that circulate.</p>
<p>Q: I’m pretty sure my daughter has the flu. Can I give her cough syrup?</p>
<p>A: There is very little evidence that over-the-counter cough syrups, cough drops and cold and flu medicines are of any benefit. In children, these products can actually be dangerous. The best treatment for a cough is hydration, so if you are sick sip water and chicken soup.</p>
<p>Q: My child is complaining about achiness – can I give my child Tylenol or baby Aspirin for the pain?</p>
<p>A: Children under the age of 18 should never be given ASA (Aspirin and similar products) because it can cause a rare but deadly condition called Reye’s syndrome. So-called baby Aspirin is not a product for children, it is a low-dose product for adults. Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen) and similar products can be used to treat pain. But recent research has suggested that Tylenol can pose risks to children with asthma and allergies. In all instances, it wise to consult a pediatrician before giving medication – especially a new medication – to a child.</p>
<p>Q: I read that the 13-year-old child who died of H1N1 had taken fever reducers. Are they dangerous?</p>
<p>A: Products like Tylenol, Advil and concoctions that contain these drugs can be used to treat pain and reduce fever. The danger is not necessarily the product per se but that they can mask symptoms and create a false sense of security. Fever, in itself, is not dangerous unless a child’s temperate is extremely high. However, some research suggests that artificially lowering fever can reduce the immune response, prolong illness and actually endanger children. As a result, some countries like Japan, say that fever reducers should never be used in children.</p>
<p>Q: What about babies?</p>
<p>A: Babies under the age of six months should not get the H1N1 vaccine. Some public health officials believe that children under age of three should get non-adjuvanted vaccine. But parents, siblings and caregivers of very young children should get the vaccine to minimize the risk of infecting the baby.</p>
<p>Q: My three-year-old daughter got the flu two weeks ago. The doctor said it was H1N1 but it was not confirmed because the region doesn’t do routine testing. My husband and I did not get sick. How can this be? We took no special precautions. Now we’re wondering: Should we get the vaccine or are we immune to this flu?</p>
<p>A: You have raised several interesting issues related to H1N1 and vaccination. First, about 90 per cent of all the flu cases in Canada today are caused H1N1. There is very little seasonal flu so far. That’s why doctors assume that cases of the flu are H1N1. Testing everyone is not considered a good use of resources.</p>
<p>Second, there is a common assumption that everyone exposed to the H1N1 virus will get the flu. In fact, the large majority of people exposed to the virus will not get sick.</p>
<p>Even though you were in close contact with someone sick with swine flu, healthy young adults like yourselves have powerful immune systems that fight off a constant barrage of pathogens. When you are exposed to a virus, your body will produce antigens and develop immune resistance. In some people, this happens with very few disease symptoms; others will get quite sick. A vaccine does the same thing by tricking the body into thinking it is being exposed the virus.</p>
<p>Many people argue that there is no need to be vaccinated, that we should depend on our immune systems and bolster them with good nutrition. That is a bit of a gamble.</p>
<p>With H1N1, a new strain, it is anticipated that about one-third of the population will get sick. To date, it is estimated that about five per cent of Canadians have fallen ill with H1N1, so a lot more sick people are expected in the coming months.</p>
<p>While it is true that most cases of the flu are “self-limiting” – meaning you get better with rest and fluids, in rare instances people can get gravely ill and die. Again, the risk of complications is greatest in those with weaker immune systems – babies, children, people with chronic health conditions – but some healthy people will get severe illness.</p>
<p>So far in Canada, 1,779 people have been hospitalized with H1N1, including 351 who ended up in intensive care and required ventilators. There have been 92 confirmed deaths.</p>
<p>That is why public health officials recommend that everyone by vaccinated unless they had a laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1. That would include you and your daughter. Even if you have immunity to H1N1, the vaccine will do no harm.</p>
<p>Q: In the online posts, many comments suggest that journalists like yourself are queue-jumpers who use their insider knowledge to get the vaccine. Are you brave enough to answer honestly?</p>
<p>A: I am in the risk category healthy adults aged 18-65. I live in Montreal. I am eligible to receive the H1N1 vaccine after Dec. 7, and so I will get my shot some time after that date. Then I will get my seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: Why aren’t teachers and daycare workers considered “high-priority” for the H1N1 vaccine? Teachers are in daily contact with children (and sick children). Also, many teachers are in their childbearing years and lots of them get pregnant. I don’t understand why teachers aren’t at the front of the line for vaccination.</p>
<p>A: When outbreaks of infectious disease occur, schools and daycare centres are invariably among the places hit first and hardest. Children are virtual microbe-spreading machines and teachers know this well – they tend to get every bug out there. By virtue of being in contact with large groups of children, teachers at relatively high risk of contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>However, the priority groups for vaccination are not those at highest risk of contracting the disease, but those at highest risk of suffering complications and dying if they are infected. This in an important distinction.</p>
<p>The priority groups are:</p>
<p>- People under 65 with chronic health conditions;</p>
<p>- Pregnant women;</p>
<p>- Children aged six months to five years of age;</p>
<p>- People living in remote and isolated communities, particularly First Nations;</p>
<p>- Front-line health workers;</p>
<p>- Care providers to those at high-risk.</p>
<p>As you can see, pregnant women (including teachers) are a high priority for the vaccine. Some jurisdictions, like Quebec, are also urging all pregnant teachers, daycare workers and health professionals to take “preventive early maternity leave” to lessen their risk of contracting H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Daycare workers who care for children under the age of six months are a high-priority group and should be vaccinated. Daycare workers and teachers of children aged six months to five years, as well as those care for or teach children with chronic health conditions like cystic fibrosis are also considered a high-priority group in most jurisdictions though there are varying interpretations of what the term “care provider to those at high-risk” means.</p>
<p>So, while not all teachers and daycare workers are at the front of the line for vaccination, some of them should be.</p>
<p>Many have wondered why front-line health-care workers are considered high priority and teachers are not. After all, nurses and doctors are not at higher risk of complications and dying if they are infected. There are two reasons: 1) Front-line health-care workers treat a lot of high-risk patients and could put those patients at grave risk if they passed on the flu bug; 2) They are needed to treat people who are sick with the flu (and other conditions), particularly if there is a pandemic that causes widespread illness. Put crudely, a sick nurse would cause a lot more sickness and social disruption than a sick teacher.</p>
<p>Q: There is a lot of talk of the risk of H1N1 to children. Can you tell me how many children have actually died? And were they all healthy? Also, how does that compare to a regular flu season?</p>
<p>A: As of Oct. 24, there have been 100 deaths from H1N1 in Canada, including six deaths in children 15 and under (that is seven per cent of the total). Only one of the children who died had an underlying health condition. By comparison, among adults, 63 per cent of the fatalities have occurred in people with an underlying condition.</p>
<p>In a ‘normal’ flu season, there are roughly 5,000 deaths, most of them seniors. Between three and five children die of seasonal influenza annually (less than 0.1 per cent), and they are usually babies with underdeveloped immune system. Deaths in the six months to 15 age category are very rare.</p>
<p>While every death of a child is tragic, it is also important to keep them in context. The greatest risk to children, by far, is unintentional injuries – motor vehicle crashes, falls, accidental poisoning – which result in almost 400 deaths a year. Another 170 children each year die of cancer. So one of the best ways to keep your child safe is to drive carefully when you head to the vaccination clinic.</p>
<p>Q: There are six priority groups for vaccination, including people under 65 with chronic medical conditions. My wife and I are both over 65; she suffers from COPD and requires oxygen. She gets the flu shot every year because she is considered high-risk. Can you tell my why she is being sent to the back of the line this time? This seems, at best, arbitrary and bureaucratic and, at worst, flagrant discrimination against seniors.</p>
<p>A: In regular flu seasons, seniors (particularly those with lung diseases like COPD) are the high-risk group. However, there is strong evidence that older people (meaning over 50) have full or partial immunity to swine flu. That is because, between 1918 and 1957, H1N1 viruses circulated commonly so most people developed antibodies that seem to protect them against the current strain of H1N1. In other words, seniors are well down the priority list because they stand to get a lot less benefit from the shot than younger people. It should be noted though that some physicians and public health officials believe that all people with respiratory conditions like COPD and asthma should be vaccinated in priority fashion, regardless of age. This is an area of some controversy. While seniors have a lower risk of contracting H1N1, if they do get infected, disease can be very severe. In fact, despite all the attention paid to the deaths of young people, the over-65 group has the highest mortality rate from H1N1 and virtually all seniors who died had underlying health conditions. Finally, don't forget that, even if they are being told to wait for the H1N1 vaccine, it is recommended that seniors get the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Globe readers have a number of questions related to blood donation and transfusion.</p>
<p>Q: I’m a long-time blood donor. Yesterday, I got the flu shot. Can I still give blood?</p>
<p>Q: I’m getting heart surgery next week. I’m wondering if can get swine flu from a transfusion?</p>
<p>Q: If you get the flu, does it stay in your blood? If you give blood will it endanger others?</p>
<p>Q: If I get blood from someone who had the vaccine, will I get the antibodies? I mean, can avoid getting the vaccine myself that way?</p>
<p>A: Yes, you can donate blood after getting flu shot, but Canadian Blood Services recommends that you wait 48 hours before doing so. This is simply an extension of normal policy, where blood donors are asked to flag if they feel unwell after a donation – an indication they may have been infected by a bacterium or a virus. That blood is discarded. Because minor reactions like fever are common after the flu shot, the wait period is a way of ensuring that blood donations are not wasted.</p>
<p>There is no wait period for getting a flu shot after a blood donation and no impact on the efficacy of the vaccine.</p>
<p>You cannot get the flu (H1N1 or seasonal) by giving or receiving blood or blood products. Influenza is a virus spread through the respiratory route; it is not blood-borne.</p>
<p>If you get a blood transfusion from someone who has had the H1N1 vaccine or who has had the flu, you will get some antibodies but it is very unlikely you will get enough to protect you. Besides, getting a vaccine is a lot less trouble than getting a transfusion.</p>
<p>So far, pandemic influenza has not had an appreciable effect on blood donation. But, with the flu becoming more widespread, the plan is to “ramp up” collection and bolster inventory to seven days’ worth from the normal five days’ supply. To do so, CBS needs 120,000 blood donations over the next six weeks.</p>
<p>Getting a needle in your arm is in vogue these days so consider getting a second needle and giving the Gift of Life.</p>
<p>Q: There’s a lot of talk about queue-jumping so I would like to know if the Prime Minister and other senior officials received priority access to the H1N1 shot?</p>
<p>A: Stephen Harper has said he will get the shot. The PM has asthma and was eligible to get the vaccine on a priority basis but he has opted to wait and get it at the same time as others in his lower-priority age group.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said her one-year-old baby, who is in a high-risk group, has been vaccinated but she is waiting her turn.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, the man who, in a $3.5-million ad campaign, has been relentlessly urging Canadians to get vaccinated and wash their hands, has not yet been vaccinated either. The chief public health officer of Canada, who suffers from both asthma and an immune condition, was going to get his H1N1 vaccine early on to set an example but, because of media reports of shortages, long waits and queue-jumping, he too opted to wait.</p>
<p>Q: My husband and I are heading to Florida in a couple of days, where we plan to spend the winter. I’m wondering if Snowbirds can get vaccinated before going south?</p>
<p>Q: I’m a frequent flyer. It seems that every day I’m on a plane with someone who is hacking and coughing. I really don’t want to get the flu and spread it to others. Public health says I can’t get the vaccine for a couple of more weeks. Doesn’t it make sense to vaccinate people like me sooner?</p>
<p>A: Being trapped on a plane for several hours with the modern-day version of Typhoid Mary is certainly no fun. But there are no special provisions to provide early vaccination to Snowbirds and frequent flyers. Remember, those given high priority are those most likely to suffer serious complications if they are infected with H1N1 influenza, not those who are most likely to actually catch the bug.</p>
<p>Public health officials are urging those who are sick to avoid mass transit, and calling on carriers to be flexible (read: no punitive charges) in allowing them to delay their travel.</p>
<p>The good news is that some jurisdictions – particularly those outside large urban centres – are vaccinating priority groups more quickly than they had anticipated so the shot will soon be available to everyone. So check with your local public health authorities before heading south.</p>
<p>Today, we have several questions related to pregnancy and babies:</p>
<p>Q: I am eight months pregnant and I have been vaccinated against H1N1. What I want to know is: Will my baby have antibodies when she is born?</p>
<p>A: Flu studies done in the past show that when pregnant women get flu shots before giving birth, they pass on immunity to their child. The baby may not have 100 per cent immunity but even partial protection can be helpful during the infants first few months of life.</p>
<p>Q: My baby is two months old and can’t be vaccinated. But I’m breastfeeding – will that protect him? (I got the adjuvanted vaccine myself because my doctor said it was safe to get while breastfeeding.)</p>
<p>A: Breastfeeding has many advantages. Breastfed children are generally healthier, which offers some protection against infection with pathogens like the H1N1 virus. Moms can also pass on some immunity to the baby in their breast milk. Finally, breastfeeding mothers themselves tend to have stronger immune systems; this reduces the chance of a contracting the flu and passing it on to her infant. And, you are correct, the vaccine is recommended for breastfeeding Moms, and if they have very young babies they are at the top of the priority list.</p>
<p>Q: We have a newborn. My husband, my other children and myself have all been vaccinated. But lots of people aren’t vaccinated so should we keep the baby out of public places just to be safe?</p>
<p>A: A key message that public health officials have tried to convey is that while H1N1 poses a risk, that risk should be kept in context and life must go on. The large majority of people – including babies – will not get sick from the flu and only a tiny minority will get gravely ill or die. While you should not deliberately put your baby in harm’s way, trying to hide away (or quarantine) the baby will not substantially reduce risk and will probably be a huge inconvenience to the family.</p>
<p>Q: I am not pregnant, but I’m trying to get pregnant. Should I get the non-adjuvanted vaccine just to be safe?</p>
<p>A: The recommendation is that pregnant women receive the non-adjuvanted vaccine. Currently, there are no provisions to provide the non-adjuvanted vaccine to others. However, by week’s end, more than one million doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine will be available – far more than there are pregnant women, so there may be some latitude. (After the queue-jumping scandals though, don’t expect clinics to stray at all from the rules. Try and raise your specific situation with an individual physician.) Public health officials, for their part, say that it is vaccination that it is important, regardless of whether you receive the adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted version. This is particularly true for pregnant women – and those trying to get pregnant – because flu symptoms (especially fever) can trigger miscarriages and injure the fetus.</p>
<p>Q: Why is the vaccine not considered safe for children under 6 months and what magically happens at 6 months to make it safe?</p>
<p>A: The issue is not safety, it is efficiency. Children under the age of six months do not have fully developed immune systems so they do not produce a good immune response to the vaccine. That is why it is recommended that caregivers and close contacts of young babies – parents, siblings, daycare workers – be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Today, we a number of questions related to legal liability and vaccination:</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that I can’t sue if the swine flu vaccine makes me sick or kills me?</p>
<p>Q: I’ve read some pretty frightening things about vaccines on the Internet. How many people do they actually kill?</p>
<p>Q: I read that in the U.S. vaccine makers can’t be sued. Is that true in Canada too?</p>
<p>Q: Why have the vaccine producers been given blanket immunity shielding them from any adverse reaction lawsuits?</p>
<p>Q: When I got the H1N1 vaccine, I had to sign a waiver that said I couldn’t sue. Is that valid?</p>
<p>A: In the U.S., federal legislation has, since the 1980s, protected vaccine makers against lawsuits related to childhood vaccines. In July, that protection was extended to makers of H1N1 vaccine. This was done because, in the litigious U.S., drug companies had essentially threatened to stop producing childhood vaccines, which are not particularly profitable and there were fears that production of the flu vaccine would be delayed by legal concerns.</p>
<p>The inability to sue manufacturers does not mean those who are vaccine-damaged cannot receive compensation. The U.S. has a “vaccine court” that hears cases and awards compensation.</p>
<p>In Canada, vaccine manufacturers do not have blanket protection from lawsuits and suits related to harm caused by vaccine are usually settled out-of-court. One province, Quebec, has a no-fault insurance program that operates in a manner similar to the U.S. vaccine court. Over two decades, there have been about 100 claims and a couple of dozen substantial awards.</p>
<p>The Canadian Paediatric Society estimates that about five children a year will potentially suffer a serious adverse event from vaccination. Bear in mind that there are almost 400,000 children born a year and they get approximately two dozen shots by the time they hit kindergarten.</p>
<p>Health officials describe the number of severe adverse reactions to influenza vaccines as “very rare.” The biggest danger is a life-threatening allergic reaction to a component of the vaccine such as egg proteins. In rare instances – again, numbers are hard to come by – a person can suffer from Guillain-Barr? syndrome after vaccination. The autoimmune condition, which is characterized by paralysis that can be reversed, is related to fever. The disastrous 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign was derailed by reports of numerous cases of Guillain-Barr?. But infectious disease experts note that the flu itself triggers far more cases of Guillain-Barr? than the vaccine.</p>
<p>On the question of “immunity” from H1N1 vaccine lawsuits (a clever play on words), the reality is a bit more complex. In the contract between the government of Canada and GlaxoSmithKline, Ottawa promises to “indemnify” anyone harmed by the vaccine. Practically, what this means is that, if you suffer harm from the vaccine, you can sue and the government, not GSK, will be responsible for paying the settlement.</p>
<p>Many have argued that this is an unnecessary gift to a big, wealthy pharmaceutical company. But the underlying philosophy – as articulated in a landmark 1985 Supreme Court judgment - is that people exposed to a potential harm while undergoing an intervention that is in the greater public good, particularly at the urging of the state, should be compensated by the state if they are harmed in the process.</p>
<p>Finally, when you get a H1N1 vaccine you will be asked to sign a waiver. The wording of these waivers varies a lot across the country but most say that you waive the right to sue those administering the vaccine – principally nurses. Lawyers consulted said that these waivers would in no way limit your ability to sue the vaccine maker of the government.</p>
<p>Q: Is the non-adjuvanted vaccine available now for pregnant women? And can we get non-adjuvanted vaccine for our kids too?</p>
<p>A: By week’s end (Nov. 10) one million doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine have been distributed to the provinces and territories. However, the vaccine, called Panvax, has not yet been approved by Health Canada. Approval is imminent so the vaccine should be available to any pregnant woman who asks by week’s end.</p>
<p>The formal recommendation is that only pregnant women get the non-adjuvanted form of the vaccine. But some parents have safety concerns because there has been limited testing of the adjuvant, particularly in younger children.</p>
<p>So the question becomes: Should you demand the non-adjuvanted vaccine?</p>
<p>The vast majority of pediatricians and public health officials will tell you that the adjuvanted vaccine is safe and that it actually works better than the non-adjuvanted vaccine – meaning it generates a better immune response, including in children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>But if you insist, will you be able to get non-adjuvanted vaccine for your child? Currently, the answer is: Probably not. Most vaccinations are being done in clinics and, after a series of queue-jumping scandals, the recommendations are being followed to the letter. Individual physicians have more freedom to provide non-adjuvanted vaccine to patients but they have been supplied with very little of that product.</p>
<p>Q: Our three girls (ages 2, 2, and 4) have been vaccinated. We were told at the clinic a half-dose was provided and to return in three weeks for the other half-dose. But then I heard on that radio that a second shot was no longer required. Can you help clear up this confusion?</p>
<p>A: The current recommendation is that children aged six months to nine years should receive the adjuvanted vaccine in two half-doses, administered 21 days apart. But the World Health Organization said last week that one half-dose provides a sufficient immune response to protect children from H1N1. The Canadian policy is currently being reviewed. Practically, the focus now is getting all children vaccinated once and, within the next couple of weeks, it will likely be announced that young children don’t need a second shot – a rare bit of good flu news for parents. For the seasonal flu, it is still recommended that children aged six months to nine years get the vaccine in two shots, at least 28 days apart.</p>
<p>Everyone 10 and over requires only one shot of H1N1 vaccine and one shot of seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Q: How will we know when the pandemic is over?</p>
<p>A: Influenza spreads in a well-established and predictable manner: The number of cases increases in an accelerating manner until it reaches a peak, and then the number of new cases gradually falls off. Public health officials will know that peak has been reached when they start to see a decrease in the number of new cases. In Canada, the peak of H1N1 influenza was reached the week of Nov. 24.</p>
<p>Q: There have been two waves of H1N1. Will there be a third wave?</p>
<p>A: The “third wave” theory is a point of much debate among public health officials. While it is possible that there could be a resurgence of H1N1 flu in the New Year – after all the flu usually peaks in January – it is unlikely. Why? Because, to date, about 40 per cent of Canadians have been vaccinated and another 10-15 per cent of the population has likely been infected. That means only about one-third of the population is at risk of contracting H1N1, so large outbreaks are not likely. However, one can expect to see a fair bit of seasonal flu early in 2010.</p>
<p>Q: In the end, how many people actually died of H1N1?</p>
<p>A: As of Dec. 19, there were 401 confirmed deaths from H1N1. A total of 1,404 Canadian were admitted to intensive care units for treatment of the swine flu; some of them will have life-long disabilities as a result. There were also 8,436 people whose flu symptoms were so severe that they required hospitalization. The most noteworthy characteristic of H1N1 was how it disproportionately affected younger people. For example, while influenza usually affects seniors, the median age of those hospitalized with H1N1 was only 28 and the median age of those who died was 53.</p>
<p>Q: When you look back were the people in the priority groups for vaccination more at risk?</p>
<p>A: According to the latest data – mid-December – those with underlying medical conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis suffered the brunt of the H1N1 epidemic. More than half of people who were hospitalized and three-quarters of the deaths occurred among those with underlying conditions that placed them at high-risk. Similarly, one in five hospitalizations and one in 12 deaths occurred among pregnant women. Finally, about seven per cent of hospitalizations and deaths were in aboriginal people while they make up only about one per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Q: How much is the “largest immunization campaign in Canadian history” costing us, the taxpayers?</p>
<p>A: The vaccine costs about $8 a dose, so the total cost is about $400-million. Far more costly though is the cost of administering and publicizing the vaccine in the hundreds of clinic sites around the country; as of mid-November, that cost had reached about $1.5-billion. So, when all is said and done, the H1N1 campaign will cost well in excess of $2-billion. The federal government is picking up 60 per cent of the tab and the provinces are on the hook for the other 40 per cent.</p>
<p>Q: Who can I call if I have more questions?</p>
<p>A: The Public Health Agency of Canada has a H1N1 hotline 1-800454-8302. Most provinces and health regions also have telehealth lines that you can call for information, including where to get a flu shot.</p>

<p>Today's top stories from Report on Business :</p>
<p>Analyst downgrade knocks RIM stock</p>
<p>A Citigroup analyst took the steam out of Research in Motion Ltd. shares, downgrading the stock to a “sell.” Analyst Jim Suva said in a note that the maker of the iconic BlackBerry faces heightened competition from other smart phone companies and that “simply put, there is an invasion of new phones, applications and competition.” He put a $50 (U.S.) target on RIM stock, sending a chill through the TSX. Mr. Suva said RIM products and applications from other companies already appear to be swaying the loyalty of some of the Canadian company's U.S. carriers. RIM executives have been trying to quell investor concerns recently.

<p>Cost of H1N1 to oustrip SARS</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu is shaping up to be a hit to the economy. Estimates indicate up to 8 million more Canadians could fall ill, meaning absenteeism will pose a threat to productivity just as the economy is struggling out of recession. The World Bank pegs the potential hit of a global pandemic, in general, at 0.7 per cent to 4.8 per cent of global gross domestic product, depending on the severity, while Bank of Montreal has calculated that a mild pandemic would cut annual growth by 2 percentage points and a severe outbreak by 6 percentage points. The costs are projected to top those of the SARS outbreak.

<p>Home construction forecast to rebound</p>
<p>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. projected new house construction will rebound sharply next year. The agency said in its fourth-quarter housing market outlook that housing starts will probably fall more than 30 per cent this year, to 141,900, but recover in 2010 with a projected level at almost 165,000. The average national listed price, CMHC said, is forecast to rise to $312,950 this year and $324,500 in 2010. Canada's real estate downturn has been remarkably short, and demand has rebounded since the beginning of the year. British Columbia will continue to be the most expensive place to live.

<p>Ford posts surprise profit</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. , alone among the Detroit auto makers in not filing for bankruptcy protection, posted a surprise third-quarter profit of $997-million (U.S.), or 29 cents a share, and forecast a “solidly profitable” 2011, better than its previous projections. The company is riding on gains in U.S. market share, cost-cutting and the U.S. government's popular “cash for clunkers” rebate program. Today's results signal that Ford's turnaround is on more solid ground: It lost more than $14.6-billion last year and has not had a full-year profit since 2005. And while it announced a profit in the second quarter, that was largely thanks to debt reductions that resulted in lower interest payments. Last week, Ford's American workers rejected a contract that would have brought its labour costs in line with those of General Motors and Chrysler, although in Canada members of the Canadian Auto Workers accepted a new deal.

<p>U.S. economy gains on three fronts</p>
<p>The U.S. economy appears to be gathering more steam, based on three indicators released today. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said its widely watched manufacturing index rose to 55.7 in October from 52.6 a month earlier. That was stronger than expected, and raised the hopes of investors searching for signs of a sustained recovery. It marked the third consecutive month of a reading above 50, the level that separates expansion from contraction. Still, there are fears in the U.S. of whether the manufacturing sector can continue to recover once the government winds down its huge stimulus programs. Surveys in Europe also showed stronger factory activity. A similar index that measures activity in the euro zone, where 16 countries share a common currency, expanded for the first time in a year and a half. Also in the United States today, fresh data showed construction spending rose 0.8 per cent in September, the first move up since April. And pending home sales, or signed contracts for deals, jumped more than 6 per cent, defying market expectations. This, said BMO Nesbitt Burns, was “pretty amazing considering this came after straight increases and as the first-time home buyer tax credit draws to an end.” Read:</p>

<p>Quality of jobs deteriorating, CIBC says</p>
<p>A new CIBC report says fewer Canadians are losing their jobs now but the quality of the jobs they hold is deteriorating. The bank's job quality index, which measures areas such as wages and whether work is full- or part-time, has dipped 3.8 per cent in the past six months. For example, part-time employment rose by about 0.2 per cent, while full-time employment fell and self-employment surged. “But the most important factor that has contributed to the recent decline in our quality index is that any gain in employment over the past six months was among low-paying jobs while the number of high-paying jobs has, in fact, declined at least 3 per cent,” the report by economist Benjamin Tal said.

<p>Nouriel Roubini eyes an asset bubble</p>
<p>Risky asset prices have risen too much, too soon and too fast, Nouriel Roubini, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and chairman of Roubini Global Economics, writes in the Financial Times. “... The longer and bigger the carry trades and the larger the asset bubble, the bigger will be the ensuing asset bubble crash,” the man nicknamed Dr. Doom writes. “The Fed and other policymakers seem unaware of the monster bubble they are creating. The longer they remain blind, the harder the markets will fall.” Read his article (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/mother-of-all-carry-trades-faces-an-inevitable-bust/article1347932/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/mother-of-all-carry-trades-faces-an-inevitable-bust/article1347932/])</p>
<p>Markets watch for Australian rate hike</p>
<p>Keep an eye on Australia's central bank. The Reserve Bank of Australia, already the first of the world's major central banks to raise its benchmark interest rate, meets again Tuesday and some economists believe it will tighten monetary policy again, by another quarter of a percentage point. That would bring the benchmark cash rate to 3.5 per cent. This was bolstered this morning by the government saying that Australia will see faster growth, and shrinking deficits, amid yet another strong sign: National house prices jumped 4.2 per cent in the third quarter to a record high. Some observers, comparing the Australian central bank with the Bank of Canada, have suggested Governor Mark Carney may follow his mates down under earlier than expected. But many economists don't expect that. Scotia Capital said this morning, for example, that while there are similarities between the two countries, there are also big differences that will likely keep the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate at a record low for much longer.

<p>Terminator franchise to be auctioned</p>
<p>“I'll be back.” That comment uttered by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in the first Terminator movie – and often mimicked by 14-year-old boys and their fathers – turned out to be more prophetic than anyone realized. The movie spawned sequels, toys and a TV series. Now, the Financial Times reports, the rights to the franchise will be auctioned later this month in a deal the newspaper says will test intellectual property valuations in Hollywood, just as the industry's profits are pressured by lower sales of DVDs. Only weeks ago, the rights to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles went for $60-million (U.S.), and Terminator will likely beat that. Several parties are watching closely the sale by Halcyon, including Summit Entertainment, the company behind the hugely successful Twilight series.

<p>Investing: Which stocks gain from a strong Canadian dollar?</p>
<p>Analysts say Canadian banks, utilities, property companies and some retailers appear to become long-term winners if the Canadian dollar resumes its recent rally to top the U.S. dollar in value, as many observers project. But manufacturers, including auto-parts makers, forestry companies and other export-dependent sectors, would continue to suffer as a stronger dollar bites into sales and profit margins. Observers say the Bank of Canada will keep interest rates low for quite a while to bolster the export sector.

<div id="hd"><b>WHO pandemic definition too broad, doctor contends; Infectious disease specialist suggests in article that World Health Organization's loose definition could lead to false alarms</b>
</div><div>Stuart Paterson  </div>
<div>631 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

  </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization's definition of what constitutes a pandemic is too broad, according to an article published this week.</p>
<p>Peter Gross, infectious disease specialist with the Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, has penned an editorial for the British Medical Journal's Clinical Evidence in which he suggests that the WHO's loose definition could lead to false alarms.</p>
<p>The WHO changed their definition last year, Dr. Gross said. Previously, a “shift” in the virus would have to occur, meaning a new subtype of the virus would have to appear in order for a pandemic to be declared.</p>
<p>A subtype is represented in the H and N numbers of a flu virus' name, such as H1N1. Another example is avian flu, which is categorized as H5N1 or, technically, as Influenza A/H5N1.</p>
<p>Now, with their recent change, Dr. Gross said the WHO has made the definition too vague. “They said a new animal or human-animal strain could qualify as a pandemic strain. That's too non-specific.” He said neither shifts nor drifts, which are subtle changes in the virus' makeup, are mentioned specifically in the guidelines for declaring a pandemic.</p>
<p>As of this year, the WHO defines a pandemic as occurring “when an animal influenza virus to which most humans have no immunity acquires the ability to cause sustained chains of human-to-human transmission leading to community-wide outbreaks. Such a virus has the potential to spread worldwide, causing a pandemic.”</p>
<p>Dr. Gross says the new definition could lead to false alarms and that “any minor change, any minor drift could be considered a pandemic.”</p>
<p>He also pointed out that, even in a medical dictionary, the definitions for the terms “pandemic” and “epidemic” are not clear, with no guidelines set on the number of people who need to be affected to reach either status, and no specific mortality rate.</p>
<p>In their 2009 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response document, the WHO defined a pandemic as simply “an epidemic on a global scale.”</p>
<p>Dr. Gross said, “H1N1 has been around for most of this century, except for 20 years mid-century, from 1957 to 1976. Nobody knows where it went, but then it re-appeared in '76.”</p>
<p>He said that since 1977, H1N1 has been included in seasonal flu vaccines, along with H3N2.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Gross said the current strain of H1N1 has undergone a significant drift in its makeup, thereby making humans less resistant to it.</p>
<p>“A seasonal flu causes about 36,000 deaths,” he said, referring to statistics in the United States. “The difference with what's going on right now is we have more morbidity and mortality among young children and young adults. Usually, it's the other end of the age-spectrum that's affected.”</p>
<p>The WHO pandemic document includes statistics for the three major pandemics of the 20th century. The worst was the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919, which also targeted young adults and killed 2 to 3 per cent of those who contracted it, worldwide.</p>
<p>“Influenza is different from most other human viruses,” he said. “When you get the measles vaccine, that lasts for a lifetime because the virus is genetically stable.” Influenza, on the other hand, is not as stable because its genetic makeup is split into pieces. If one strain meets another, the pieces mix together. “When it comes out, who knows what it's going to look like?”</p>
<p>“We just need a better definition of all of this,” Dr. Gross said. “It's really kind of amazing after all these years that it's not clearer.”</p>

<p>Developmentsin the ongoing H1N1 pandemic in Canada and the world:</p>
<p>Ottawa</p>
<p>Canada's top doctor acknowledged Sunday that health officials didn't expect so many people to line up for the swine flu shot.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer, said that as recently as a few weeks ago officials didn't anticipate such long lineups at clinics for the H1N1 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Edmonton</p>
<p>Alberta's Opposition Liberals want the health minister to resign after a decision to temporarily suspend all swine flu vaccination clinics, the party's leader said Sunday.</p>
<p>Dr. David Swann, who is also a physician, stood outside a closed clinic in Calgary on Sunday as he accused Health Minister Ron Liepert of mismanaging the province's pandemic response.</p>
<p>Ottawa</p>
<p>The experts who advise Canada on vaccine policy said Sunday it is unnecessary to delay giving seasonal flu shots this year.</p>
<p>They urged provinces and territories to offer the shots as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The National Advisory Committee on immunization said seasonal shots can be given before, after or at the same time as pandemic flu shots, if that can still be arranged.</p>
<p>Toronto</p>
<p>Ontario's top health officials said Sunday flu clinics will be doubled in the province for high priority groups and she expects the vaccine rollout to run more smoothly this week. Dr. Arlene King said hundreds of family doctors will also be administering shots this week and advised doctors to use every dose they are given by week's end.</p>
<p>St. John’s, N.L</p>
<p>Newfoundland recorded its first swine flu death on the weekend. Health Minister Jerome Kennedy confirmed Sunday that a 36-year-old woman from the province's central region died Saturday night after contracting the H1N1 virus. He said the woman had an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>In the United States, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama said Sunday the government will catch up to the demand for H1N1 flu vaccine within a week.</p>
<p>David Axelrod said the manufacturers of the vaccine were wrong when they advised the administration this year that they would have 40 million doses ready near the end of October. Instead, only 28 million doses of vaccine were available. Axelrod said 10 million more doses are expected this week.</p>
<p>Guantanamo Bay</p>
<p>Terrorism suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay naval base will soon get H1N1 flu vaccines, despite complaints that American civilians should have priority.</p>
<p>Army Maj. James Crabtree, a spokesperson for the U.S. jail facility, said Sunday the doses should start arriving this month, with guards and then inmates scheduled for inoculations. He said there may be an "emotional response" from critics who argue that terror suspects should not be allocated swine-flu medications while members of the U.S. public are still waiting due to a vaccine shortage.</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>You might not be able to get your H1N1 flu shot any time soon.</p>
<p>Authorities are asking the general public to stay away from three public flu clinics planned this week. Family doctors are also being asked to avoid inoculating the general public.</p>
<p>Flu shots are to be reserved for people considered at higher risk of the new flu.</p>
<p>This includes people under 65 with chronic health conditions, children aged six months to five years, pregnant women, health care workers and people in remote communities.</p>
<p>"We will continue to ask healthy people to let those at greater risk be immunized first," said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, associate medical officer of health. Signs will be posted to remind people of the target groups.</p>
<p>Wang said authorities are relying on the honour system, saying public health nurses can't verify medical histories.</p>
<p>Authorities do not plan to hold more than three clinics this week, even as other communities extend hours and sites. This is in part because so much vaccine has been shipped to local family doctors.</p>
<p>Many people at higher risk who want the vaccine can get it from their family doctors, officials said.</p>
<p>Pregnant women without family doctors will be able to receive vaccinations from public health via appointment by calling 519-883-2272.</p>
<p>The vaccine is being rationed because there's not enough to immunize everyone who wants it. On Saturday, long lineups overwhelmed two local clinics held for people at higher risk.</p>
<p>An estimated 3,000 people were inoculated in Kitchener and Cambridge. People had to wait three to six hours for their needles, often lining up outside in windy, damp conditions. Many others were turned away. Authorities shut down lineups three hours early to accommodate the crowds.</p>
<p>Worried parents with children endured hours in long lines.</p>
<p>"You've got to do what you need to do," said Chris Forte, father of two.</p>
<p>Forte, his wife Stephanie and their two children were among the first to get flu shots in Kitchener, after waiting almost four hours. Chris Forte joined a lineup already in place at 6 a.m., three hours before the clinic opened.</p>
<p>Their son Jordan, 10, has a health condition and is considered at higher risk. They also brought daughter Mackenzie, seven.</p>
<p>"As a mom, you've got to protect your children, and you want to do anything you can," Tracy Moxon said.</p>
<p>She waited almost six hours to be vaccinated in Cambridge with son Cooper, age three. That's longer than she expected but "I don't have to worry about it now," she said.</p>
<p>The two clinics had up to 30 public health nurses wielding needles, 20 in Kitchener and 10 in Cambridge. The estimated tally is 2,000 inoculated in Kitchener and 1,000 in Cambridge.</p>
<p>"We're very thankful that people were that understanding and patient," Wang said. "We were amazed."</p>
<p>"People want the vaccine," she said. "It's good that they do."</p>
<p>Wang expects similar crowds may show up at H1N1 clinics this week. Authorities will try to keep people lined up inside buildings as much as possible, she said.</p>
<p>Local H1N1 clinics run from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. this week:</p>
<p>Nov. 3 at Stanley Park Community Centre, 505 Franklin St. N. in Kitchener.</p>
<p>Nov. 4 at Jacob Hespeler Secondary School, 355 Holiday Inn Dr. in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Nov. 5 at Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex, 101 Father David Bauer Dr.</p>
<p>The mood in the Saturday lineups was remarkably patient. But there was also frustration.</p>
<p>"They should be able to accommodate the people, before they (announce) where all the clinics are going to be," Andy Ioannou said.</p>
<p>He brought his two children, aged five and two, to the Kitchener clinic in the early afternoon, only to be told the clinic was overwhelmed and the lineup closed.</p>
<p>Saturday's lineup in Kitchener extended around a sports field at Huron Heights Secondary School on Strasburg Road. Parked cars filled nearby streets. In Cambridge, people lined up around the municipal building at 150 Main St.</p>
<p>Many people dressed warmly, brought strollers, lawn chairs and umbrellas. Police officers attended in both cities for crowd control.</p>
<p>Guy Savard and his family waited almost five hours to be vaccinated. "Everybody's at risk here," Savard said about his family.</p>
<p>Mom Anne Savard has asthma. Daughter Brandy, 21, is pregnant. Daughter Kaila, 20, has a heart condition. One of their two young grandsons also has a health condition.</p>
<p>Standing outside, the Savards shuffled about to keep warm. They were bundled in scarves and coats.</p>
<p>They've been worried about the dangers of H1N1. They grew more concerned after learning of the healthy Toronto boy who died of the flu last week.</p>
<p>"I think half of Kitchener will be here today," Anne Savard said. "There should have been a lot more places open than just two."</p>
<p>People in the lineups asked why so few clinics are opening, and why schools aren't vaccinating children.</p>
<p>"If we had a lot of vaccine, then of course the idea of more clinics would be viable," Wang said.</p>
<p>Officials now expect everyone who wants the vaccine will be able to have it by Christmas. But right now, it's in short supply due to manufacturing issues.</p>
<p>The public health department has shipped vaccine to family doctors and has enough for public clinics this week, Wang said. Timing of the future supply remains uncertain.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 shot a hard sell</b>
</div><div>By Michelle McQuigge   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>653 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>All-day lineups and fresh warnings of a looming shortage of vaccine have suddenly left Canada's public-health watchdogs with a daunting marketing challenge: convincing the internet generation of the importance of the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>If that public-relations effort is to successfully target one of the most vulnerable segments of the population, it must be aimed specifically at a younger demographic and make careful and extensive use of modern-day new-media tools, experts say.</p>
<p>Ottawa faces a formidable communications dilemma - balancing the need to raise awareness of the flu vaccine without inciting panic, said Alan Middleton, marketing professor at York University's Schulich School of Business in Toronto.</p>
<p>The current marketing strategy, which is heavily dependent on traditional media such as newspapers and television, is working for adults, but not for youth.</p>
<p>"You're dealing with a population that is not good at necessarily cognitively assessing risk," Middleton said.</p>
<p>A dictatorial message runs the risk of alienating youth either by making them fearful or by raising the spectre of a "Big Brother" figure interfering in their lives, Middleton said.</p>
<p>Canadians under the age of 21 should be told to get informed rather than to get vaccinated, and the message needs to be delivered primarily through modern media tools such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and Twitter.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is in the process of compiling a communications strategy for the immunization program, the largest in Canadian history. An agency spokesperson said officials have not yet decided whether to adopt a uniform approach or target separate segments of the population.</p>
<p>But there are no specific plans in the works to target youth, a perplexing fact considering that younger Canadians are considered especially vulnerable to H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"This is a younger people's flu," said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>"In a usual flu season, 90 per cent of the deaths are among people over the age of 65. In H1N1, 90 per cent of the deaths are in people under the age of 65."</p>
<p>In Canada, the crude hospitalization rate among children under 15 was 12.1 per 100,000 people, more than double the national average of 5.3 per 100,000.</p>
<p>Middleton suggested Ottawa establish a central online clearing-house of flu-related information, including symptoms and treatments, then use social-networking tools such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to distribute word of the resources available online. Resources such as Twitter can be deployed more extensively in the event the pandemic gets significantly worse.</p>
<p>A government-controlled source of information would enable youth to make informed decisions about vaccination, while minimizing the risk of sowing fear, Middleton said.</p>
<p>Problem is, it's an approach that's not likely to find favour with government communications strategists, who are often beset by a lack of technical savvy and governed by the bureaucracy that surrounds them.</p>
<p>"There is a tendency in all public sector advertising to focus on what looks good in the boardroom and to the minister, rather than what is likely to work out in the real world."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada does include H1N1 flu fact sheets on its website and has established a footing on the most common social network sites, where it provides regular updates on the latest H1N1 flu developments.</p>
<p>But numbers suggest the agency's online efforts are not yet reaching a wide audience. The public health agency's <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page has just 1,190 fans, while its Twitter feed has attracted 1,161 followers to date.</p>

<p>Alouettes down Bombers, tie team record with 14th win</p>
<p>MONTREAL - The Montreal Alouettes' late-season slide looks to be over. Anthony Calvillo returned from a calf injury to throw two touchdown passes and Damon Duval kicked six field goals as the Alouettes pounded the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 48-13 on Sunday afternoon for a team record-tying 14th win of the season. The victory came a week after a 41-24 loss in Winnipeg with backup Adrian McPherson at quarterback and gave the Alouettes a perfect 9-0 record at home for the season. Calvillo said he'll be ready to play when the Alouettes (14-3) go after a 15th win against the 3-14 Argonauts in Toronto.</p>

<p>Sickness, injuries cause cancellation of game</p>
<p>MONCTON, N.B. - Nobody who plays for or works for the Moncton Wildcats has been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. But sickness and injuries have taken a severe toll on the club, leading to the cancellation of Sunday's game against the Montreal Juniors at Moncton Coliseum. The Wildcats had only 11 players who were healthy enough to suit up. The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League made the decision about 90 minutes before the scheduled 4 p.m. local time start. "Following the recommendations of the Moncton Wildcats' medical staff and the chief medical officer of the QMJHL, Sylvain Boutet, the game will be rescheduled in order to preserve the health and the security of our players," said Marcel Patenaude, the league's vice-president of hockey operations. Wildcats general manager Bill Schurman said a rescheduled date and ticketing information will be released this week</p>

During the second intermission, the Capitals announced he "may return" but did not indicate what the injury was.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Civil service and Ottawa fail to deliver</b>
</div><div>James Travers  </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Something is growing in this country other than the serpentine queues outside flu shot clinics. It's the federal civil service and that relentless expansion is particularly embarrassing at a time when frightened citizens are turning to their government for help.</p>
<p>There's no direct connection between the length of H1N1 lines and the number of public servants. But there should be a relationship between the bureaucracy's size and the quality of services it delivers.</p>
<p>That correlation isn't apparent in the muddled management of Canada's largest-ever immunization. Confusion, the slow delivery of vaccine and new warnings about short supply are frustrating Canadians while exposing Conservatives to viral attacks.</p>
<p>Opposition parties are convinced Stephen Harper is politically susceptible to the flu.</p>
<p>They accuse the Conservatives of spending more time and money on partisan stimulus advertising than informing Canadians about H1N1 or ensuring a smooth, adequate vaccine supply.</p>
<p>Of course, the charge is laced with the usual hyperbole. But as Conservative strategist Tom Flanagan cynically noted recently, political propositions don't have to be true, just plausible. This one is steeped in enough fact and fear to be a threat.</p>
<p>It couldn't matter less to pregnant women, worried parents or patients with underlying conditions that Ottawa and the provinces share responsibility for health or that ample doses are on order. What matters is the hours, days or months they must wait for shots.</p>
<p>Wearying for those ready to roll up their sleeves, the delays are a Stephen Harper headache.</p>
<p>Fair or not, the constant news presence of Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, is morphing into the message that the pandemic is Ottawa's problem.</p>
<p>Bad for Conservatives, that's worrying for the bureaucracy. Every fatality and each new glitch is another blow to a civil service struggling with a reputation, ruined by the gun registry fiasco, that it's incapable of providing programs in real time and at reasonable cost.</p>
<p>So it's awkward as well as revealing that the federal payroll is growing many times faster than inflation at a time when deficits are ballooning and the immunization effort is under unflattering scrutiny. Following a decade-long trend, the number of public employees grew last year by 4.5 per cent, or about 9,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Conservatives now defending their flu strategy, the health department -- along with defence, border services and public safety -- benefited from some of that growth. Still, the numbers that count most and the ones the government is pressed to explain, are in the crowds outside the clinics.</p>
<p>It's self-evident to those now milling outside immunization sites that there must be a better way. Waiting for hours only to be told to come back tomorrow isn't just annoying: it strains the bonds between state and citizens. It's evidence this government and civil servants weren't properly prepared for a test predicted months ago and now proving to be so alarming.</p>
<p>A crisis mismanaged is an opportunity missed.</p>
<p>Politicians could have seized the moment to remind Canadians there are some things only government can do. Bureaucrats could have risen to the considerable H1N1 challenge by proving to the country that public servants are still willing and able to do some things well.</p>
<p>Instead, political rivals are finger pointing while Canadians seethe. Instead, mandarins are building empires while the country stands in line for services.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>Kudos to the health-care workers who are staffing the flu-shot clinics.</p>
<p>I was at Jackson Square with approximately 400 other people to get the shot for my asthmatic daughter last Wednesday. The line moved smoothly, and the whole process was extremely well-organized, thanks in large part to the caring and patience of the women and men there.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario's Health Minister Deb Matthews says the province will look into Toronto Public Health's decision to give doses of the H1N1 vaccine to a private clinic in Toronto.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to be second-guessing Toronto's medical officer of health in the middle of a pandemic on this decision, but I am saying, when all this is behind us, it is a question we're going to want to take a pretty good look at," Matthews said at a news conference on Sunday.</p>
<p>The decision to give Medcan, a private, "preventative health-care clinic" 3,000 vaccines on Friday for its high-paying members created controversy over the weekend.</p>
<p>The private clinic says it will consult with public health to see if it can offer the vaccine to high-risk members of the general public by appointment.</p>
<p>Medcan has said it may offer the vaccine to nonmembers who come equipped with a referral from public health officials.</p>
<p>"We thought perhaps we could talk to them (Toronto Public Health) about reaching out to individuals who have disabilities and can't stand in line for long periods of time," said Bronwen Evans, the vice-president of corporate affairs for Medcan.</p>
<p>But with public health units swamped, and long lineups winding around for blocks outside clinics, the requirement for a referral would be next to impossible, says a representative of the nurses association.</p>
<p>"Either we ask the proof from everybody or we don't ask from anybody, otherwise we create inequity and we create gaps between the haves and have nots," said Doris Grinspun, the executive director of the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario.</p>
<p>Grinspun said asking for proof of high-risk conditions from everyone would overwhelm primary care centres, because people would have to get a doctor's note before going to the private clinic for the shot.</p>

<p>While thousands of Canadians line up for vaccinations seeking protection against swine flu, countless others across the country have already had their brush with the H1N1 virus. Cases have ranged from mild to so severe that a sick patient can spend weeks in the intensive-care unit of a hospital.</p>
<p>Here are some personal experiences:</p>
<p>Brian Menzies of Victoria can't confirm he had H1N1 but says the flu he apparently contracted from his seven-year-old daughter was worse than any he's had previously.</p>
<p>The self-employed public affairs consultant first became ill Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p>"My daughter had symptoms of the flu as well. She was vomiting," said Menzies. "It didn't take me much longer to feel pretty much the same way.</p>
<p>"It actually hit me pretty quickly. For that first week I had a pretty high fever and loss of appetite, all those sorts of signs, completely different from having a cold."</p>
<p>"I was having difficulty breathing. In fact, I was so surprised how quickly my lungs became very sore. I was having difficulty coughing. It was a dry cough and that sort of thing."</p>
<p>Menzies waited three days to go to the doctor, and only after calling the provincial government's health help line. He went to a nearby walk-in clinic.</p>
<p>"I do have a family doctor, but I felt that it's usually quicker to go into a clinic."</p>
<p>The doctor did not test him for H1N1 and said he did not need to come back.</p>
<p>"I'd asked him to listen to my lungs to make sure I didn't have any fluid in them.</p>
<p>"I'd had bronchitis previously and my bronchitis seems to have been aggravated."</p>
<p>Menzies said he started to feel better last Monday but is still getting over laryngitis.</p>
<p>His daughter was out of school for a week and Menzies says about a third of her Grade 2 class was also ill at one point.</p>
<p>"She was a lot more resilient than I was," he says. "I was amazed at how much it hit my lungs and how much it took me out of it in terms of lack of appetite and feeling really tired."</p>
<p>-- Steve Mertl, Vancouver</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>For weeks, Brendan Boyd thought he had a simple fall cold.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old from Nova Scotia had just returned to high school in Cole Harbour and chalked up persistent congestion, a headache and general fatigue to the rigours of getting back to class.</p>
<p>He didn't let the lingering symptoms slow him down too much as he continued working two jobs, going to school and hanging out with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>But when he developed a fever and became so dizzy on Oct. 20 that he fell over at work, he and his mother decided it was time to see the doctor.</p>
<p>"It was pretty bad that day," he said from his home, where the whole family has been quarantined.</p>
<p>"I had a fever of 102 and was so tired I slept for 14 hours."</p>
<p>Boyd was tested for H1N1 soon after he collapsed. The next day, the family doctor called to let them know the result came back positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Boyd said he was given medications and quickly began feeling better, but was ordered by the doctor to stay at home for a week with his parents and sister, who have not become sick.</p>
<p>The teen said the onset of severe symptoms -- high temperature and intense fatigue -- was surprisingly quick, but that he didn't feel too bad in the days leading up to his fever.</p>
<p>"I'm feeling pretty good now," he said, eager for the imposed quarantine to end. "I don't know what all the fuss is about."</p>
<p>-- Alison Auld, Halifax</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>On a hog farm, it's not unusual to see one or two animals coughing, but Arnold Van Ginkel knew he had a problem last May when a couple hundred animals in his herd of more than 3,000 appeared to be sick.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel called a vet, the vet called Alberta Agriculture and Alberta Agriculture called the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>What followed was an international incident that pushed Canada's already depressed hog industry even further into turmoil and almost cost Van Ginkel his livelihood.</p>
<p>It turns out the Rocky Mountain House, Alta., hog farmer had the first reported case of the new H1N1 virus in pigs.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel's farm was put under quarantine. No animals could be shipped out for slaughter.</p>
<p>Pigs can catch flu viruses from infected pigs and people, mostly from coughing and sneezing, but there's no proof people can get the H1N1 virus from pigs or eating pork.</p>
<p>Still, several countries, including China, banned imports of Alberta pork.</p>
<p>Van Ginkel was left in a tough spot.</p>
<p>He was watching his industry suffer. He was also watching his herd grow to a point where he could no longer handle it.</p>
<p>"Normally, when you run a farm, you have your building set up, it is always just about full, so if you cannot ship, you have a huge problem and that is what happened to me," he says. "They keep growing and you can't do anything about it. It's just life."</p>
<p>He culled 500 animals because he ran out of space.</p>
<p>As the weeks stretched on and his farm remained under quarantine, Van Ginkel knew what he had to do.</p>
<p>In June, the entire 3,000-head herd was culled.</p>
<p>He has received some compensation from the Alberta government and some from the federal government, but he is still waiting for more.</p>
<p>He's begun the slow process of rebuilding his herd, but that will take at least 10 months.</p>
<p>He's frustrated with the way everything played out and wishes the CFIA had been more decisive early on and culled his herd before news of the infection broke.</p>

<p>Dan Demarais, a 41-year-old nurse, appears to have contracted a mild case of the illness two weeks ago from his 25-year-old roommate Theresa, who's also a nurse. She got a confirmed case while tending other H1N1 patients at Lions Gate Hospital in Vancouver.</p>
<p>"She was home for seven days. I was just trying to take care of her and in the process just catching a lesser form of it -- just chills and a cold that lasted about five days."</p>
<p>"First of all it comes on like a bad cold. You're going to have sniffles, headache and body aches, and then you start getting major temps and breaking fevers. For the first two or three days you're literally in bed just laid out; you're aching everywhere."</p>
<p>"I put myself on fluids and I started taking vitamin C and echinacea."</p>
<p>His roommate was hit harder.</p>
<p>"It went into her lungs, a lot of coughing and so forth. She was in bed for seven days.</p>
<p>"She's fine now. She was in more direct contact and I was secondary to her and I knew to stay away from her."</p>

</p>
<p>Hamilton is being battered these days by a double whammy. There is flu. There is fear.</p>
<p>On Halloween weekend, two Hamilton flu assessment centres opened their doors for the first time to take the strain off emergency wards.</p>
<p>People with the flu are asked to go and be assessed as to how ill they are.</p>
<p>The centres resemble sets from science fiction movies. Security guards at each entrance at the West End Clinic on Main Street West donned hospital masks and visors, as did the medical staff on hand to determine just how seriously ill visitors were.</p>
<p>Each visitor was offered hand sanitizer and hospital masks as they waited to be looked at. The waiting areas fill with sickly-looking people and worried family members, each wearing their own mask. The constant coughing underlines that these people are sick.</p>
<p>Centres director Dr. David McCann said Hamilton is experiencing a flu outbreak and that flu is H1N1. Some 85 Hamilton schools have declared outbreaks.</p>
<p>"Nothing else in the community looks like this. The numbers from the swabs that have been done indicate every single case is H1N1. So from a purely statistical point of view if it walks like a horse, neighs like a horse, it's a horse. It's all over. It's everywhere.</p>
<p>"There is no other flu strain in Hamilton or Ontario and we don't expect there to be another flu strain until at least January or February if at all."</p>
<p>The centres operate in he same way as doctors' offices. Seriously ill patients are advised to head directly to emergency wards. Most are told to head home for two or three days of bed rest.</p>
<p>The centres can prescribe Tamiflu for seriously ill flu sufferers but they are not administering the H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>"For the majority of people this is a benign, mild illness. So we give them handouts on how to shelter at home, take Advil and Tylenol and lots of fluids and come back if they get worse.</p>
<p>"Most people don't get worse. For the vast majority three or four days of misery and they are better," he said.</p>
<p>But there is a subgroup. Those people, including pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions like diabetes or heart disease and children under five -- especially children under two -- who could have severe and life threatening flu.</p>
<p>That is the group that is being treated with Tamiflu.</p>
<p>McCann acknowledges there is fear in the community.</p>
<p>"Most flu seasons far more deaths occur than what we're seeing with this bug," he said. Flu-related deaths of children in Etobicoke and Cornwall have ramped up the fear factor.</p>
<p>"But those are exceedingly rare occasions," he said.</p>
<p>Amy Hood Almas turned up at the West End centre on Saturday with her son Matthew, 5. He has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for several days.</p>
<p>"I think it is scary. I don't think we know much about it at all. It is really scary," she said, adding she is concerned her son seemed to get better only to suffer a setback.</p>
<p>Susana Videlic has a seriously ill child at McMaster.</p>
<p>Videlic has been ill but learned at the centre she doesn't have H1N1.</p>
<p>"People who have kids are scared," she said.</p>
<p>Videlic said she has been visiting the intensive care unit for several days and is used to seeing health care workers with the protective garb.</p>
<p>"I think when you first see it, it is really scary," she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamilton Health Sciences is restricting children under the age of 16 from visiting the obstetrical and gynecological units, including labour and delivery, at McMaster University Medical Centre.</p>
<p>HAMILTON'S TWO H1N1 ASSESSMENT CENTRES</p>
<p>The centres are at 690 Main St. W. and the St. Joseph's East End Ambulatory Care Centre, 2757 King St. E.</p>
<p>The centres are open 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends.</p>
<p>The centres, which do not provide vaccinations, are expected to stay open for the next four weeks.</p>

</p>
<p>Hamilton and Halton are among the communities in Ontario hardest hit by H1N1.</p>
<p>They are two of only five health units in Ontario reporting widespread flu as early as Oct. 18.</p>
<p>The result has been 65 per cent more visits than normal to the emergency department at McMaster Children's Hospital and doctors fielding five times more calls than usual.</p>
<p>Assessment clinics with masked staff and patients have opened in Hamilton to take the pressure off swamped emergency rooms and physicians.</p>
<p>A previously complacent public is alarmed enough to stand for up to five hours in line to get flu shots particularly after the sudden deaths of a previously healthy 13-year-old Mississauga hockey player and a 10-year-old eastern Ontario girl.</p>
<p>"We're not supposed to die of infectious disease any more, that's the way people think," said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. "Kids are far more likely to die in traffic accidents than they are to die of H1N1. But driving is so much a part of our lives, you sort of accept that. But with things like flu ... It does really throw them off. As a parent, you read those stories and they're very upsetting."</p>
<p>While Gardam and other public health officials are glad the community is shaken up enough to get vaccinated, they don't want people to panic.</p>
<p>"I don't think they should be afraid of H1N1," Gardam said. "We're expecting a lot of people to potentially be sick with this. We're not expecting a lot of people to die from this. That's the first message."</p>
<p>Gardam expects the overall toll of H1N1 won't be that different from the estimated 20,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 to 8,000 deaths in Canada each year from influenza.</p>
<p>But what is different is who it targets.</p>
<p>"If seasonal flu is going to take someone away, it's typically kids in the first year of life or the elderly," Gardam said. "It's not usually 13-year-old kids who are healthy."</p>
<p>Children, who have no immunity to H1N1, are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. There are outbreaks in more than 50 per cent of Hamilton public schools and up to 20 per cent of kids are absent from the classroom. But odds are they will be mildly sick and recover.</p>
<p>"The number of kids that die is still a relatively small number," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health. "Their rate of being infected and hospitalized is much higher, their rate of dying is lower than for older adults."</p>
<p>But it's not just the virus itself that the public finds scary. The shot to protect yourself from H1N1 also has people on edge.</p>
<p>When Hamilton's associate medical officer of health Dr. Chris Mackie answered questions from the public last week on Spec Live at thespec.com, the most frequent topic by far was how safe is the flu shot.</p>
<p>Mackie repeatedly advised people to get their flu shot and said he lined up with his wife and baby to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>The main sticking points have been the preservative in the vaccine called Thimerosal and the immune booster called adjuvant, which is being used for the first time in flu shots in Canada. The adjuvant contains Squalene, Tocopherol and Polysorbate.</p>
<p>"These components have been used in many vaccines and found to be safe," Mackie said. "Squalene is a normal metabolite found in everyone's blood at all times. Tocopherol is vitamin E. Polysorbate is in all kinds of things we consume, including ice cream. Thimerosal is a preservative to maintain vaccine sterility. All existing data points to the vaccine and adjuvant being safe."</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts say there is no evidence these components are linked to health problems such as autism and Guillain Barre Syndrome.</p>
<p>"People have tried very hard to find links," Gardam said. "The problem is they don't have any scientific water. There is no scientific evidence to these fears."</p>
<p>However, he says there is evidence the flu shot will keep your kid out of the intensive care unit or at the very least save you from three days in bed and up to a month of feeling lousy.</p>
<p>That message appears to be getting through too well, with people lining up to get the shot who aren't among those at highest risk of getting sick. Hamilton is clamping down on who gets the shot after determining one-third of the people vaccinated so far aren't the ones who need it most.</p>
<p>It's the worst possible time now that the public finally wants the shot as H1N1 appears to be at its peak in Hamilton and Halton.</p>
<p>"It's quite encouraging for us to see people taking it more seriously," Mackie said. "I think there's been a perception that it only affects people with severe medical conditions or the elderly. The fact is we do have young people who die of influenza every year and that's because young people have excellent immune systems and one of the ways to die is actually for your body to overreact."</p>
<p>The sudden death last week of Evan Frustaglio, 13, who had no underlying health issues, was the turning point for many Ontarians to take notice of H1N1.</p>
<p>"They're not panicking, they're finally paying attention," said risk communication expert Peter Sandman. "I'd be telling people the pandemic is serious and they're right to worry about it. I'd tell people that if you're worried about the vaccine that's understandable but the vaccine is a whole lot less dangerous than the pandemic."</p>

<p>THE Winnipeg Regional Healthy Authority is reminding the public the priority list for the H1N1 vaccine has been narrowed from last week and those not on the list will not be vaccinated if they go to a clinic today.</p>
<p>The groups on the priority list are: all aboriginal people, children from six months to under five years, pregnant women and people under 55 with a severe chronic medical or other risk condition. That includes people with serious asthma that has led to hospitalization or requires frequent visits to the doctor.</p>
<p>Vaccination clinics will only be open today, from 9:30 a.m.- 8 p.m. Locations are the same as last week, except in the Inkster neighbourhood, where the clinic has moved to the Philippine-Canadian Centre of Manitoba at 737 Keewatin St.</p>
<p>No clinics are scheduled after Monday, until the province receives more vaccine doses.</p>
<p>The provincial government expects to receive a special H1N1 vaccine early this week that is recommended for pregnant women; however pregnant women are welcome to get the regular vaccine at today's clinics.</p>
<p>The WRHA reports the number of daily visits to Children's Hospital emergency is higher than usual.</p>
<p>There are nine people in Winnipeg hospitals on ventilators suffering severe respiratory conditions. One of these has been confirmed as a case of H1N1 flu; five have tested negative for H1N1 and three remaining cases are pending laboratory confirmation.</p>

<p>He became the iconic face of the H1N1 outbreak earlier this year, but today, toddler Peter Flett is more concerned with exploring the living room than wearing a tiny flu mask.</p>
<p>It's been several months since baby Peter was flown to Winnipeg with severe flu symptoms. His face became the symbol of H1N1's impact on remote First Nations -- splashed across newspapers and TV screens across the country the same day the World Health Organization pointed out that aboriginal people, in particular, were hit hard by the virus.</p>
<p>Today, there are no signs of illness in Flett's Garden Hill home or his notoriety. He's made a full recovery and life is as normal as it gets in the small but tidy two-bedroom house. He's part of a family of 10 who live there.</p>
<p>The house sits at the bottom of a slight slope, next to a white van with smashed windows and a broken-down washing machine. Crushed cardboard boxes are strewn near the house's mud-caked front steps, beside empty soda cans and bits of scattered trash. Plastic covers the windows.</p>
<p>Inside, a sign that reads "God bless our home" greets visitors.</p>
<p>Before the H1N1 flu hit, it was TB.</p>
<p>Coun. Jack Harper, Flett's grandfather, said his earliest memory is of being taken to hospital in Norway House to recover from the disease. Since then, TB has been intertwined with his family's history. In 2006, Harper drove 13 hours on a winter road to take his wife Nellie to hospital in Winnipeg, where she was in isolation with infectious TB for three weeks. All his children tested positive for TB and had to take medication. His brother-in-law had TB, and his teenage niece had TB, too.</p>
<p>The cycle of infection for this family never stopped.</p>
<p>But Harper and others say the recent flu outbreak is a wake-up call that if things don't change, the health and social ills festering in First Nations communities will continue to worsen. The ferocity with which H1N1 influenza affected aboriginal people was a symptom of all the same problems that promoted TB -- overcrowded houses, malnutrition, substance abuse.</p>
<p>"I have three families living in my house," Harper said. "What's in the house right now? Is there disease between the walls?"</p>
<p>A hidden</p>
<p>statistic</p>
<p>The federal and provincial governments refuse to divulge the rate of TB on Manitoba reserves.</p>
<p>It took months of in-depth research -- via sources, documents and visits to remote communities -- for the Free Press to discover which reserves have been hit hard by TB and why. It's the first time this information has been made public.</p>
<p>On some Manitoba reserves, the rate of TB is more than 600 cases per 100,000 -- more than 100 times what it should be. By comparison, the national rate in Canada is five cases per 100,000. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, the rate is slightly below 400 cases per 100,000.</p>
<p>Free Press reporter Jen Skerritt received a $20,000 Journalism Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to investigate tuberculosis in Manitoba. The stories, photos, videos and interactive website are the result of months of research and collaboration with the Free Press TB team.</p>

</p>
<p>Garden HILL, Man. -- It was winter 2006, and Texas hold 'em poker was starting to take off in Garden Hill, a fly-in community about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg on the shores of Island Lake.</p>
<p>The reserve's 4,000 residents were packed into 500 houses, and groups of avid poker players killed time by gathering in confined spaces to deal cards, licking their fingers as they dealt each card.</p>
<p>No one knew TB was quietly spreading.</p>
<p>Patient Zero had been living on the streets of Winnipeg and drinking a lot until some community members picked him up and drove him back to the reserve, Chief David Harper said.</p>
<p>Substance abuse increases the likelihood sleeping TB -- when TB germs lie dormant and can't spread to other people -- will activate in the body. At some point, either in or Winnipeg or Garden Hill, the man became contagious.</p>
<p>Harper said the outbreak went undetected for eight months because many people who went to the nursing station with symptoms were sent home and told to take Tylenol. By the time anyone noticed, more than a dozen people had active TB. More than 200 residents were screened for symptoms.</p>
<p>The search for TB cases spread from the remote community to a Winnipeg diner, where the man often ate breakfast. Public health nurses tested breakfast regulars who'd shared airspace with the man. Health officials never named the diner or said whether anyone who ate breakfast there tested positive for TB.</p>
<p>"When he got the call that he had TB, another person we knew had symptoms," Harper said. "He has TB and another one and another one and another one."</p>
<p>Provincial health officials publicly announced a TB outbreak had hit but refused to say where. The public had no clue where the disease was spreading until three weeks later when Harper spoke publicly about the outbreak in his northern community.</p>
<p>The outbreak highlighted gaps in health care on reserves and prompted Harper and other First Nations leaders to call for immediate action.</p>
<p>Harper blamed the disease spread on the community's poor health-care infrastructure and abysmal living conditions. At the time of the outbreak, the community had no permanent doctor and the nursing station was short five nurses. There was a shortage of houses, a lack of running water in many existing houses and hundreds of families lived in overcrowded houses where diseases such as TB spread easily.</p>
<p>Not much has changed in the three years since.</p>
<p>TB cases still sporadically appear here. The community does not have even one permanent doctor, and Harper says the nursing station is still routinely short-staffed. Half of the 500 overcrowded houses on the reserve aren't hooked up to the main water line, so that handwashing -- one of the keys to preventing the spread of disease -- is difficult for hundreds of people.</p>
<p>The community suffers high rates of infectious and chronic diseases, among them diabetes and TB. Harper said the recent H1N1 outbreak that swept through Garden Hill and nearby St. Theresa Point is proof the problems haven't been solved.</p>
<p>It's another example of TB flourishing in a First Nations community because of living conditions similar to those in Third World countries.</p>
<p>"We can't continue living like this," Harper said.</p>
<p>"It's not every day that a child or an elder turns their tap and takes a shower. We don't have those privileges. It's been 100 years, and we still don't live the way Canada expects us to live."</p>
<p>Garden Hill is nestled on the pristine shores of Island Lake, within boating distance of three other reserves, including Wasagamack, Red Sucker Lake and St. Theresa Point. In total, about 10,000 people live in the Island Lake region.</p>
<p>When TB hit in 2006, Harper said cases were missed for months because staff at the nursing station didn't recognize signs of the disease and sent patients home.</p>
<p>Some say that's a clear sign nursing stations are ill-equipped to offer proper medical care to a large volume of patients -- nurses don't have time to do proper health education and outreach.</p>
<p>"It's always in a state of crisis," said Andy Wood, executive director of Four Arrows Regional Health Authority, a health group that lobbies on behalf of four Island Lake communities.</p>
<p>Wood said the federal government spends more than $40 million a year flying sick patients to Winnipeg because there is no emergency medical care on reserve -- Wood, Harper and others think it would be better spent beefing up health-care services on First Nations reserves.</p>
<p>According to documents the Free Press obtained through access-to-information legislation, Health Canada spent close to $18 million in 2008 to medevac people from Manitoba and Saskatchewan reserves for tuberculosis treatment -- nearly $6 million more than in 2004.</p>
<p>Government officials refused to provide a detailed breakdown for Manitoba.</p>
<p>A community the size of Garden Hill in southern Manitoba would have a hospital with 38 beds and six doctors, Harper said. About 4,000 people live in Altona, and five physicians are registered to work at the local clinic, according to data from the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Emergency medical care is available in the sunflower capital 24 hours a day, along with low-risk general surgery and obstetrics.</p>
<p>"Nobody can seem to agree on how to approach this. Meanwhile, they're spending $40 million a year," Wood said.</p>
<p>Duncan Monias's TB went undetected for three months.</p>
<p>Monias said he first felt sick at his uncle's funeral just before Christmas 2005. He thought it was a cold but went to see a nurse when his symptoms didn't subside. A nurse told him his blood sugar was low due to his diabetes. No one took an X-ray or questioned why he had suddenly lost 40 pounds.</p>
<p>It wasn't until three months later, when Monias was gravely ill and flown to Winnipeg from Garden Hill, that an X-ray showed he had advanced TB. By that time, the disease had scarred Monias's right lung so badly part of it had to be removed.</p>
<p>It's the hottest day of the summer of 2009 on the reserve, and Monias struggles to catch his breath after he walks up a slight incline to greet visitors at his house. The 50-year-old plunks down on a bench in the shade and says his life will never be normal.</p>
<p>"It's a very, very big change. You're not the same person you were before," Monias said, saying he was in hospital nine months and came home with an oxygen tank. "I can't even lift anything, can't even mop the floor. I get tired too easy, I can't catch my breath."</p>
<p>Federal health officials would not respond to what they called "unspecified allegations" that nurses on reserves have misdiagnosed people with symptoms of TB.</p>
<p>Dr. Linda Poffenroth, regional director of First Nations and Inuit Health in Manitoba, said nursing stations are equipped with adequate resources and staff to deal with TB, and that federal officials will send more nurses or health-care workers to communities that need it. Poffenroth refused to respond to concerns that overall health care on reserves is inadequate.</p>
<p>"I think the purpose of our time today is around TB, so I will stick with that," she said.</p>
<p>Residents are told to wash their hands to prevent diseases such as TB from spreading.</p>
<p>Yet something so simple can be daunting in Garden Hill, where half the families on reserve live with no running water.</p>
<p>Just ask Wallace Knott. He has never lived in a home with a toilet or shower. The 54-year-old goes to the bathroom in a pail.</p>
<p>Knott's house sits on the edge of Island Lake on the north side of Garden Hill. Almost every house here is dotted with massive scrawls of gang graffiti, litter is strewn along pothole-pitted gravel roads and remains of broken-down trucks and vans beyond repair have been torched in makeshift junkyards.</p>
<p>Every day, Knott takes a bucket to the lake and fills it with water. In winter, he chisels a hole in the ice until it's big enough that he can fill a pail.</p>
<p>Knott dumps his waste from the pail in a garbage-laden mud trench next to his house. The runoff makes its way down to the lake, to the same spot where he collects his water.</p>
<p>Two years ago, he was exposed to a person with infectious TB and had to take medication for nine months to rid his body of the germ. He completed treatment.</p>
<p>But still, he waits for his house to be hooked up to a water line.</p>
<p>"There's no running water, which means I go (to the washroom) in a pail," Knott said. "You don't shower; you can't shower.</p>
<p>"The community's lack of running water and problems with substance abuse put residents at a higher risk of contracting diseases such as TB."</p>
<p>There is one water-delivery truck for the entire reserve, but when the Free Press visited, it was broken.</p>
<p>That means Rev. Donald Little won't be able to wash his grandchildren for another day. Four of his grandchildren are under five years old, and all of them are covered in red sores from not bathing often enough.</p>
<p>People such as Michael Knott and Ananias Harper don't have a house to live in because of the chronic shortage on this reserve. They live in an abandoned teacherage-turned-flophouse where they spend their days drinking "super juice" -- moonshine concocted in a pail or smuggled in from Winnipeg by area gangs. Both say they've been beaten and robbed several times and that the violence has escalated in the last three years.</p>
<p>"Other countries are going to ask to speak to Canada. Is this the real Canada?" Chief Harper said.</p>

</div><div>No handshakes for soccer players   </div>

</p>
<p>NO handshakes. That's the latest rule for Winnipeg Youth Soccer in response to the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"It's just a precaution," said Alastair Gillespie, president of the Winnipeg Youth Soccer Association. "It's purely for protection."</p>
<p>The association's indoor season is into its second week and teams, parents and officials were informed last week of the change.</p>
<p>A notice about the no-handshaking rule has been posted on the WYSA web page.</p>
<p>"Please be advised that due to pandemic H1N1 influenza, pre-game handshakes will no longer be required of teams," the notice states. "This is merely in response to the H1N1 influenza and not a diminishment of our expectations of fair play and sportsmanship."</p>
<p>Gillespie said the move follows the death last week of a 13-year-old hockey player in Ontario, who died after contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't want to see anything like that happening."</p>
<p>Gillespie said he and the WYSA have received emails recently from parents asking if a handshaking ban would be into effect as an H1N1 precaution.</p>
<p>Players will still line up before and after games, Gillespie said, but the players will only acknowledge opposing players with a nod and a comment. The WYSA appears to be the only local sports league banning handshakes as a precaution to the spread of H1N1. The Manitoba High Schools Athletic Association said last week banning handshakes was unnecessary.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>1 million shots already taken against swine flu; epidemic 'breaking out rapidly' Stress increasing on emergency rooms across country as vaccine shortfall looms</b>
</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY   </div>

<div>586 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>As Canada faces twin threats this week of a dramatic vaccine shortfall and increases in flu activity, federal government data released to Canwest News Service show the provinces and territories have used just over one million doses of swine flu drugs from the national antiviral stockpile to fight the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>It is a sign of how many people may already have been sickened by the virus, as the second wave of infection spreads across the country.</p>
<p>Today is Day 8 of the most ambitious immunization program in Canada's history, and this week will probably see more long lineups for unexpectedly scarce shots, more stress on emergency rooms and intensive-care units, and more health-care workers and schoolchildren falling sick.</p>
<p>In Toronto, a call has been put out to family doctors to help assess patients with flu symptoms in crowded emergency rooms. In Ottawa, public health officials are preparing to set up a network of flu clinics across the city to divert people away from ERs. In Quebec, the health minister has promised that every Quebecer who wants the vaccination will have it. Inoculation clinics are to open Friday.</p>
<p>As cities struggle to cope with a vaccine shortfall that could stretch to several weeks, delaying shots to all but the most vulnerable, Canada's chief public health officer is urging patience. Dr. David Butler-Jones says the government remains on target to have every Canadian who wishes to be vaccinated immunized by Christmas.</p>
<p>Some worry that, by then, much of the wave will be over.</p>
<p>"The epidemic is breaking out pretty rapidly across the country," said Anand Kumar, who specializes in the care of critically ill patients with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. "The only way you're going to blunt it is to get as many people vaccinated as fast as you can." According to latest data from the Public Health Agency of Canada, the country is experiencing "striking" increases in flu activity across the country, particularly in the West, and in Newfoundland, which said yesterday it had experienced its first H1N1-related death: a 36-year-old woman who had a pre-existing medical condition.</p>
<p>Anti-virals and vaccines are the cornerstone of Canada's strategy to fight H1N1. Canada has a national stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral medicines: Tamiflu and Relenza. As of Oct. 26, the provinces and territories had used 1,046,671 doses since H1N1 struck in April.</p>

<p>Re: "Our soldiers needed at home" ( Letters, Oct.31).</p>
<p>Jalaluddin S. Hussain seems to be under the impression that after eight years in Afghanistan, "nothing substantial has been achieved." Well, allow me put his mind at ease.</p>
<p>In Kandahar province alone Canada is involved in 48 programs, ranging from health and education to water supply, micro finance and de-mining. Hussain can rest assured that the Afghan people appreciate Canada's substantial contribution, even if he doesn't, and that our volunteers are doing an outstanding job.</p>
<p>As for "controlling the H1N1 pandemic" he's right. We'll have to be vaccinated without a military escort.</p>

</div><div>AFP</div>
<div>594 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Inter Milan continued its inexorable march toward a fifth straight Italian Serie A championship with a 2-0 victory away to lowly Livorno yesterday.</p>
<p>There might only be 11 games gone in the regular season, but Inter already has opened up a seven-point lead over second-placed Juventus, after the Turin giants were beaten 3-2 at home to Napoli on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sampdoria failed to keep pace with Inter as it was held to a 0-0 draw at home to Bari, leaving it third on goal difference behind Juve.</p>
<p>Inter looked uncertan against a team that had won its previous two matches under new boss Serse Cosmi, but always looked capable of doing enough to win.</p>
<p>The opener came four minutes into the second half as Diego Milito, back in the starting lineup after making a substitute appearance in midweek on his return from injury, turned at the edge of the box before shooting low through a crowd of legs into the bottom corner.</p>
<p>Brazilian full-back Maicon then sealed the victory 10 minutes from time as he burst forward from his half, played a one-two with Patrick Vieira and reached the edge of the box unchallenged before slotting home left-footed.</p>
<p>This relatively comfortable stroll in the park was ideal preparation for Inter ahead of its midweek trip to Ukraine to face Dynamo Kiev in a crucial Champions League match.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>Paris Saint Germain put its swine flu woes behind and recorded it first victory since the end of August by winning 4-1 at Sochaux in Ligue 1.</p>
<p>Jeremy Clement was one of the players to have contracted the virus that prompted the last-minute postponement of PSG's match at Marseille last weekend, but he scored the opener before Clement Chantome notched the second.</p>
<p>Mevlut Erding claimed the third on his return to his former club, while Peguy Luyindula was also on target as PSG climbed above Sochaux into 10th place.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>Shay Given was Manchester City's hero as the goalkeeper produced several fine saves to earn Mark Hughes's men a point in their goalless Premier League draw away to Birmingham City.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stalemate at</p>
<p>St. Andrews was enlivened by an impressive display from Republic of Ireland international Given, including a penalty save from Scotland's James McFadden. Man City's fourth straight draw was good enough to take the visitors into fourth place.</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>Valencia reclaimed fourth spot from Real Mallorca thanks to a fortunate 1-0 win over cellar-dweller Malaga with defender David Navarro's first goal of the season clinching the points.</p>
<p>Centre-back Navarro headed in a Pablo Hernandez cross for the winner on 68 minutes as Valencia moved a point behind third-placed Sevilla.</p>
<p>David Villa, the league's joint top-scorer with seven goals, almost scored for Valencia in the third minute when his cross hit the post.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Hoffenheim's Brazil striker Maicosuel hit a first-half goal to seal a 1-0 win over Freiburg that put his side fifth in the Bundesliga and knocked Bayern Munich down to sixth.</p>
<p>Hoffenheim's hot-shot striker Vedad Ibisevic set up the goal when he played the Brazilian into the penalty area and the South American lobbed his shot out of reach of Freiburg goalkeeper Simon Pouplin in the 39th minute.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sanitizing your workout at the gym; Wiping down shared equipment, washing your hands should be standard practice</b>
</div><div>Jill Barker   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>904 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Exercise is a known immunity booster, which is why Health Canada recommends regular workouts as part of its strategy to protect against the H1N1 virus. But is the gym the best place to avoid the flu, or is the shared equipment and sweaty population prime breeding ground for a virus that experts say has reached pandemic status?</p>
<p>"You're more likely to get the flu from the guy on the treadmill next to you than from the treadmill itself," said Dalius Briedis, an infectious disease specialist at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).</p>
<p>H1N1 is predominantly transferred from individual to individual through aerosol droplets in the air, which means being coughed on by someone beside you is the most likely way for the flu to be transmitted. So, the first step in staying healthy is asking exercisers to avoid the gym when they are sick.</p>
<p>That being said, Briedis noted that it is possible for the virus to stay viable for a short period of time on a hard surface like a piece of fitness equipment. Therefore it's prudent to take extra precautions when using equipment that is passed from one exerciser to the next, like cardio and weight training machines, exercise balls and dumbbells.</p>
<p>"If you come in contact with the virus and then touch your face, nose or eyes, it's possible to get the flu," said Briedis.</p>
<p>Wiping down equipment with a cleaning solution after use, draping a clean towel over an exercise mat or bench and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after a workout should be standard practice in gyms across the country.</p>
<p>But gym rats aren't the only exercisers who need to take special precautions when it comes to avoiding the flu. According to Briedis, sport teams are also at increased risk of exposure to the H1N1 virus. The proximity of athletes to each other and to their personal belongings makes the virus easy to pass along from one teammate to the next. And once the flu hits one team member, there's no telling how quickly it will spread and the kind of impact it can have on a team's ability to field enough players to compete.</p>
<p>A look back in history suggests that the flu can have devastating effects on a team.</p>
<p>"In the winter of 1918-19, the Stanley Cup playoffs were cancelled due to an outbreak of the Spanish flu," said Briedis. "Four members of the Canadiens team got sick and one died."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the H1N1 virus has been linked to a small number of fatalities worldwide and, for the most part, results in a moderate fever, aches and pains and a runny nose, which in a healthy population means spending a few days in bed recuperating. But that doesn't mean it can be treated lightly by teams and leagues across the country.</p>
<p>Simple precautions can reduce the risk. Water bottles and towels shouldn't be shared between athletes (all towels should be removed from team benches) and a protocol should be in place to keep sick athletes away from their healthy teammates.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends quarantining an athlete until they are symptom free (no coughing, sneezing or fever) for 24 hours. If an athlete gets sick on the road, they should be put in a private room and wear a mask during the bus ride home where they should sit as far away from their teammates as possible. The same goes for the sick athlete's roommate who should be kept under a watchful eye for three days before placing them back on the playing roster.</p>
<p>As for the ritual of shaking hands after a game, Briedis isn't in favour of suspending this age old tradition. With physical contact a natural consequence of most team sports, there is little to be gained by forgoing shaking hands, especially if athletes wash their hands or use hand sanitizers immediately after the game.</p>
<p>The ritual Briedis is in favour of forgoing, however, is the Montreal two-cheek kiss, which he claims should be suspended until after the H1N1 virus runs its course.</p>
<p>If the flu does strike, the decision to exercise or compete is probably moot as fever and the associated aches and pains will relegate all but the hardiest to bed until the symptoms abate. The average time to recuperate is three to seven days, after which exercisers are encouraged to get back in the game or gym slowly.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends waiting for 24 hours after the fever has abated before resuming light exercise.</p>
<p>A body recuperating from the flu is quick to fatigue, so respect the signals your body is sending and take it easy if you feel less than 100 per cent during your workout.</p>
<p>Precautions should also be taken before exercising in the cold, especially if your flu symptoms included a cough and runny nose.</p>
<p>Cold air can further irritate already inflamed bronchial pathways, causing a rebound case of bronchitis and another couple of days in bed.</p>
<p>Once you feel up to speed, go ahead and resume your normal workouts. Exercise is still the best medicine for a healthy mind and body.</p>

<p>Judging by the headlines, many people in Canada won't be taking the H1N1 vaccine now that it's available.</p>
<p>It's just the opposite in the developing world. Canada has put its international immunization initiative, which saves about half a million of the poorest lives each year, under reassessment, with no plans to extend it.</p>
<p>Imagine the outcry in our country if the H1N1 vaccine were withheld. The international immunization initiative should be immediately extended -- and, indeed, expanded.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank The Sun for its refreshingly rational, science-based coverage of efforts to bring H1N1-prevention measures to the public. There is much confusion afoot about how best to protect ourselves and you appear to have made an effort to follow facts supporting what is most likely to be efficacious and what the realistic drawbacks are.</p>
<p>A popular weekly paper in Vancouver has taken to promoting practices that are demonstrably dangerous to public health, including homeopathy and vaccination denial. It's good to see that someone in the business of spreading the news is doing so responsibly.</p>

<p>Re: Swine flu shot? Not for this little piggy, Oct. 24</p>
<p>Quite correctly, columnist Shelley Fralic notes that polio, TB, smallpox and measles have been virtually eradicated by modern medicine. Why not add seasonal flu to that list? The risk from the vaccine is negligible compared to the risk from the disease.</p>
<p>Her concern that our immune systems will go on evolutionary strike is quite unfounded. On the contrary, that's how the immune system works. Vaccination takes advantage of five million years of primate evolutionary adaptation. It's certainly not modern, but it works exceptionally well.</p>

<p>Although columnist Craig McInnes did a superb job debunking the myths surrounding the H1N1 vaccine ("Separating myth from fact in debate about flu vaccine," Oct. 27), the people who read The Sun probably don't need myths debunked. They're literate and educated enough to know the truth already.</p>

<p>As one of many family doctors working in busy clinics, I've found that we are better prepared for this flu pandemic than we were for past crises, this despite the fact that many of us get the latest news from the media, filtering that information with our scientific training.</p>
<p>The B.C. Medical Association's website gives us a roundup of current information.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I still feel we are working with this by the seat of our pants.</p>
<p>This makes me reflect and want to comment. Let us, as a society, continue to learn from this experience. This type of outbreak is not the last that will come our way.</p>
<p>Yes, we doctors were yelled at and sworn at last week over shortages of the promised vaccine. Even as so many deride the "hype," much panic is evident.</p>
<p>Let's control our emotions, trust our bodies and spend our energy on the simple but effective strategies that should be public knowledge by now: Avoid crowds, when possible; wash your hands, especially when arriving home, etc.</p>
<p>For the first time, I'm being forced to think much more globally in the office. I've been asking after others in patients' households and about travel plans and pregnancy intentions.</p>
<p>We are thus being forced to look after one another. We doctors keep learning, and I keep urging patients to maintain their own inner strength and health as the prime defence.</p>

<p>They lived in Canada's small towns and big cities, from coast to coast. They were children, parents, friends and neighbours. Some had health problems before the virus struck them down, but many were young and vital.</p>
<p>Scientists are still trying to determine why H1N1 affects some people and not others, and why it hits some more severely. But for those who knew and loved those who have died with H1N1, the loss has been heartbreaking.</p>
<p>So far, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, the virus known as "swine flu" has killed 95 Canadians. Their names are not released by government for privacy reasons, but the identities of some have emerged over the months.</p>
<p>Here are the stories of nine Canadians who have died from H1N1.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Ashley Miller, 26, from Mission, died Oct. 11 after coming down with H1N1 and spending two days in hospital in Abbotsford. The mother of a one-year-old daughter named Emma, Miller was otherwise healthy before getting sick. She was the eighth person to die of H1N1 in B.C., but the first person in the province to die who had no underlying health issues.</p>
<p>Tina L'Hirondelle was the first confirmed death from H1N1 in Canada. The 39-year-old had a history of asthma and diabetes and died in hospital in High Prairie, Alta., on April 28, after saying she was having difficulty breathing. She lived in the Metis settlement of Gift Lake and may have contracted the virus from her mother, who had a mild case of H1N1.</p>
<p>Hannah Arsenault Dicks, known as "Hannah-Banana," a six-year-old from La Ronge, Sask., died in July after contracting H1N1 while in hospital for a bone condition. Dicks had many health problems, had been tube-fed since birth and was unable to walk or talk.</p>
<p>Karin Shiozaki died in Kingston General Hospital on Oct. 19 after complaining of shortness of breath, coughing and discomfort. The 52-year-old woman from Newboro, Ont., had a history of asthma and was overweight. She worked as a respiratory technologist and left behind her husband of 33 years, Ian Kent Shiozaki, and two grown children, Alix and Jesse.</p>
<p>Vanetia Warner, 10, died a few days after showing symptoms, at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario on Oct. 24. Vanetia, a Grade 5 student at St. Anne's Catholic School in Cornwall, was a healthy child whose death sparked a wave of concern among parents.</p>
<p>Rubjit Thindal, 6, from Brampton, Ont., died from the virus on June 15. Her symptoms included joint pain, fever, and later, a persistent stomach ache. On the way to the hospital, the Grade 1 student at Roberta Bondar School went limp. Her father tried to revive her with CPR; she died two hours later.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio, 13, was a minor hockey player with the Mississauga North Stars who attended Hill Academy, in Vaughan, Ont. On Oct. 24, during a hockey tournament in London, Ont., he developed a sore throat and fever. Two days later, he collapsed on his bathroom floor and was pronounced dead on Oct. 26.</p>
<p>Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni, 23, died on Aug. 14, two months after giving birth to her son, Yassine, in June. Kaitouni, a day care worker, was hospitalized at Montreal's Sacre Coeur Hospital with high fever during the last months of her pregnancy. After developing severe respiratory problems, Kaitouni was given a C-section, and then put in a medically induced coma until her death from H1N1.</p>
<p>Annette Sampson, 51, of L'Ardoise in Cape Breton in Nova Scotia was the first H1N1 victim from Atlantic Canada. Sampson fell ill on July 1 and slowly worsened until her death in a Halifax hospital on July 24.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First responders challenge flu shot priorities; Police, firefighters say they should be next in line</b>
</div><div>Gwendolyn Richards   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>615 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>With the H1N1 virus forcing an entire fire station to book off sick and a police station also seeing the virus's impact, emergency response officials are questioning why the province didn't give more consideration to vaccinating police and firefighters.</p>
<p>Neither the head of the Calgary police union, nor the deputy chief of the city's emergency management agency want to see first responders immunized ahead of those considered at high-risk for the swine flu, but both believe they should be next in line.</p>
<p>"I hope the province reconsiders the impact this could have on emergency personnel who are on the front line of response," said Calgary Police Association president John Dooks.</p>
<p>"It could be catastrophic if it goes through the district offices or a fire-hall; you could bring down an entire station."</p>
<p>But that has already happened.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, an entire fire station had to book off because all the firefighters were sick.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, we're on top of our staffing and were able to reallocate staff to that location," said emergency management's Tom Sampson.</p>
<p>The police service's District 4-- which is responsible for areas such as Forest Lawn, Dover and Marlborough-- has also had to tell officers to stay away from work because they are sick.</p>
<p>"I don't think they thought through the consequences," Dooks said of the government's decision to offer the vaccine to Albertans en masse.</p>
<p>A new plan for vaccinations will see shots given only to those considered high-risk:pregnant women, children between the ages of six months and less than five years, people under the age of 65 with chronic health conditions and medical workers, including paramedics.</p>
<p>Paramedics are considered first-tier health care workers and are part of the priority group for vaccinations.</p>
<p>But, Sampson said, firefighters and police are often called to the same incidents as paramedics -- about 25,000 calls per year.</p>
<p>"It's important that the team that goes to those calls feels confident they have some form of protection," he said.</p>
<p>However, he also praised the province's move to return to a plan that gives priority to those considered at high risk for the virus. He added firefighters, police and those who work in other essential service areas should receive the shot immediately after the high-risk groups.</p>
<p>"For some time, we believed those who are the most susceptible, those with a medical history that dictates it, they should be at the front of the line. We didn't ask to be at the front of the line," he said.</p>
<p>"I understand the priorities, but we should be right behind them."</p>
<p>On Sunday, Alberta's chief medical officer of health said when more vaccine becomes available, emergency responders will be next in line.</p>
<p>"As we move through the week and determine what our supply situation is . . . first responders (will) then be considered for the next round of vaccination," Dr. Andre Corriveau said.</p>
<p>Those arriving to clinics on Sunday only to find them closed said they were disappointed firefighters and police weren't given a higher priority for vaccines.</p>
<p>"Police and EMS should get it first thing," Ben Taylor said outside of the old Alberta Children's Hospital. "I would never go in front of those people."</p>
<p>Senior Gail Reid agreed, decrying the fact that first responders were lining up for their vaccinations with everyone else.</p>
<p>"That's stupid," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Blame taken in clinic chaos; Alberta's top doctor bails out health minister</b>
</div><div>Suzanne Wilton   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>886 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>As Alberta's health minister faced calls for his resignation Sunday, the province's top doctor took responsibility for the H1N1 immunization plan that has left Calgarians angry, frustrated and confused over long lineups to get the vaccine, and now the closure of the clinics that were administering it.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau said it was his decision to initially open clinics to all Albertans last Monday, close them Saturday and not reopen them until at least Tuesday. When they do reopen, the vaccine will initially be restricted to those in high-risk groups, including pregnant women, kids under six and those under 65 with chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>His comments come as Health Minister Ron Liepert faces further criticism over the pandemic planning, and a call by the official Opposition for his head.</p>
<p>But Liepert rejected Liberal Leader David Swann's demand for his resignation, saying he was and is still following the advice of the province's medical experts, who decided to stop offering the vaccine to the general public when it became clear the demand for the vaccine would outstrip a supply that is now expected to fall short.</p>
<p>Inoculation clinics will remain closed until at least Tuesday as health officials figure out how to deliver vaccines specifically to those in the target groups.</p>
<p>"We have followed right from Day 1 the plan that was laid out by the chief medical officer of health and public health officials throughout the province," Liepert told reporters during a conference call on Sunday.</p>
<p>"I want to make it clear, I'm not trying to shift responsibility for this decision. What I'm saying is, they are the chief medical experts so it would be inappropriate for us politically to change that," added Liepert.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Liberal Leader David Swann called for Liepert to resign, saying the Tory health minister couldn't be trusted to manage our health-care system--a system Swann accused Liepert of throwing into chaos.</p>
<p>"It is clearly over his head," said Swann during a news conference in front of the closed Richmond Diagnostic Treatment Centre, where people continued to turn up on Sunday in search of a vaccination.</p>
<p>Swann said Alberta's pandemic plan outlines a commitment to vaccinate high-risk individuals first, but that was ignored when it was announced no one would be turned away from getting a swine flu shot.</p>
<p>Indeed, Albertans seem to have received mixed messages since the clinics opened early last week.</p>
<p>Both Liepert and Premier Ed Stelmach, while urging those at high-risk to get inoculated first, also emphasized that no one would be turned away. Liepert even went so far as to say that Alberta would not go into "Soviet Union mode" and require people to prove they need it, but then had to backtrack as the clinics were halted in the face of an unexpected supply shortage.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he admitted, "Voluntary compliance did not work."</p>
<p>As the H1N1 flu vaccination chaos and subsequent blame game continued with Swann's calls for Liepert to resign, Alberta's chief medical officer stepped into the fray. Dr. Corriveau stood behind the initial rollout and now the need to change plans and restrict the vaccination to those who most need it.</p>
<p>Corriveau said health officials didn't anticipate the overwhelming numbers of people who turned up at the clinics. That was then complicated by the news later in the week that Alberta would only receive an additional 80,000 doses, compared to the 220,000 that were expected.</p>
<p>"I want to make it clear that these decisions were made by us, public health officials and I take full responsibility for any of those decisions," said Corriveau, who participated in the conference call with Liepert Sunday.</p>
<p>"I myself made them in consultation with Alberta Health Services . . .," said Corriveau, referring to the new health superboard that's responsible for the actual execution of the plan.</p>
<p>But Corriveau wore the blame alone; no one from Alberta Health Services, the new superboard charged with the actual execution of the flu clinics, participated in the news conference.</p>
<p>Liepert, meantime, said mistake is not a word that he'll accept in reference to the inoculation program.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to accept the word mistake when today, the most recent numbers . . . show that over 400,000 Albertans have been immunized."</p>
<p>As for his resignation, Liepert reiterated the vaccination plan wasn't his, but rather developed by doctors--a fraternity to which Swann belongs as a physician himself.</p>
<p>"He is obviously challenging the credibility of our chief medical officers of health, and . . . I find that a little offensive," said Liepert.</p>
<p>"It's great to be a Monday morning quarterback. But if he's challenging Dr. Corriveau's plan, he should say so. Unless he's got some other reasons for me to resign, I don't know what they might be."</p>

</div><div>Joanne Ireland   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>859 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>GAME TIME</p>
<p>OILERS AT ISLANDERS 5 p.m. 630 CHed, Pay per view</p>
<p>There is a wheeze where there was once a quiet breath, leaving Mike Comrie uncertain about his status for today's showdown with the surging New York Islanders.</p>
<p>At least he made it to the Edmonton Oilers practice. Centre Shawn Horcoff, the latest of the players to be dropped by the flu, was sent back to the team's hotel room.</p>
<p>Head coach Pat Quinn? He has managed to dodge the bug, but he is definitely sick of all the other ailments--like the shortage of wins, the lack of goals, the shoddy defensive play of his team.</p>
<p>"Is it our mental toughness?Our physical well-being? I guess it's probably a combination of both," said Quinn.</p>
<p>His charges are not only a mere 1-4 in their last five games, they have been shut out in three of their last four, and now they have a meeting with the Islanders, who are on a three-game win streak.</p>
<p>"Our offence will come from our defence. Our defence sucks right now," Quinn said.</p>
<p>"When you give up too much and spend too much time in your zone, a victory is getting it out instead of putting it in their net."</p>
<p>Comrie has missed four of the last five games with a flu that continues to ravage the locker-room. He wasn't tested for H1N1, nor was defence-man Lubomir Visnovsky, who missed the last two games.</p>
<p>But compounding Comrie's recovery is the fact that he has asthma, and this flu strain attacks the upper respiratory system.</p>
<p>Horcoff, meanwhile, started to show signs of the illness on the eve of the 2-0 loss to the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>"It's been a struggle to try to catch my breath," Comrie said. "The hardest part is you want to be out there, you want to make a difference ... but they want me to be closer to 100 per cent. We have a lot of guys who are sick who score goals, so we're going to try to do it by committee, and hopefully we can get healthy."</p>
<p>"I don't know what I had, I just felt very bad," said Visnovksy, whose defensive partner, Ladislav Smid, was diagnosed with H1N1. "My body was very tired. I had headaches, I couldn't focus."</p>
<p>Gilbert Brule, who was down for three games, said it took him a couple of days to get back to where he left off. He isn't surprised the team's energy game has gone AWOL.</p>
<p>That, however, means taking a smarter approach and that is something the Oilers have not been able to accomplish.</p>
<p>"On the nights where we don't have that energy, when we're not that physical, we have to be in better spots. You have to play smarter-- and we haven't learned that," captain Ethan Moreau said.</p>
<p>"This is a huge game for us," said general manager Steve Tambellini. "We want to go home on a good note. We want a better compete level."</p>
<p>"I know we've had a situation here the last couple of weeks with the flu, and that's been very difficult, but we need a better compete level," Tambellini said. "Every team at some time will go through something, whether it's flu or injuries. You can't use it as a crutch, or excuse, or whatever you want to call it. You have to find some way to gather energy to fight through it."</p>
<p>Moreau has one assist in 11 games, Patrick O'Sullivan has gone six games without a regulation goal. Andrew Cogliano is pointless in eight, which makes his slide one game shorter than Zack Stortini's. The power-play defencemen too are cold. Tom Gilbert, who had 45 points in 82 games last season, has two assists in 14 games.</p>
<p>Denis Grebeshkov has two assists in the last eight games after putting up six points in the first six games.</p>
<p>"You'll get offensive chances from being sound defensively," Moreau said. "If we're in better spots we'll have better transitions. We're just not good enough defensively right now."</p>
<p>"We have to start thinking about the defensive side again and making sure we don't give up much," said Quinn. "We do it well sometimes. For half games. (In Boston) we started giving them the puck, turning it over, then the next thing you know, we're in our zone, not theirs, and thinking about surviving rather than winning a hockey game. Our defencemen need help from the forwards. They need to be much more involved in the play without the puck than they have been."</p>

</p>
<p>I am a taxpaying, working mother of two small children--a five-year-old and a one-year-old.</p>
<p>My five-year-old has a history of breathing problems when he gets a fever that has required numerous trips to the Stollery over the years.</p>
<p>Tuesday, I left work early to go to the flu shot clinic in Beaumont. Upon arriving with one child in my arms and another holding my hand, I was told that the line had been cut off at 3p.m. I was a tad annoyed at being turned away.</p>
<p>I decided that it might be better to go to a clinic in Edmonton that was open until 8 p.m. Thursday, I again left work early to pick up the kids and get to the clinic by 4:30 p.m. Again, we were told that the line had already been closed for the day.</p>
<p>I was beyond frustrated that I'd left work early two days in one week to protect my children's health and still was not able to have them vaccinated.</p>
<p>I do not understand why healthy adults are getting this vaccine before my children--one of whom is considered high risk. Even more annoying is that, now, the homeless in Edmonton are receiving this vaccine before my children. These people don't even pay taxes.</p>
<p>Why didn't the government offer the vaccine at elementary schools first, along with vaccinating high-risk adults and small children?</p>
<p>And why do homeless people, who don't even pay taxes, get to avoid waiting in lines at the clinics? This just doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>Someone needs to be held accountable for the poor administration of this vaccination program.</p>
<p>I hope that answers come sooner rather than later as to why high-risk individuals and children did not receive this vaccine first.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Gatineau mayor wins re-election; Low voter turnout biggest surprise of civic election</b>
</div><div>Dave Rogers   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>567 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>After a count lasting more than three hours in Gatineau's civic election on Sunday, Marc Bureau was was re-elected to a second term as mayor with only a 39-per-cent voter turnout.</p>
<p>The vote count took longer than expected, but Bureau stayed well ahead of his closest rivals throughout the evening and was elected to a second term as mayor by 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Bureau received about 44 per cent of the popular vote with 30,929 votes compared to 26 per cent for Aurèle Desjardins with 18,551 votes and 24 per cent for Tony Cannavino with 17,119 votes. The three remaining candidates -- Roger Fleury (1,198 votes), Luc Desjardins (1,266 votes) and Richard Gravel (1,052 votes) -- trailed with just over one per cent of the vote each.</p>
<p>Luc Angers, who was acclaimed in Des Promenades district, said he was surprised that only a small percentage of the city's 180,000 eligible voters went to the polls,</p>
<p>"When I talked to voters in my district, people said they wanted to vote because they felt it was their democratic right," Angers said. "The scandals in Montreal may have had an effect here, some people may have been afraid because of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>He added, "Some candidates were saying the same thing on certain issues and there wasn't one of them who stood out."</p>
<p>Guy Chiasson, a political science professor at the Université du Québec en Outaouais, agreed on that point. He said the campaign, which included six mayoral candidates and 43 council candidates, produced no interesting issues or personalities.</p>
<p>Five members of Projet Gatineau ran for council, but denied being a municipal party with ambitions to control the city. Members said they wanted to plan for the whole city instead of being limited to district issues.</p>
<p>The ballots took longer to count because the Quebec government placed a moratorium on electronic vote counting and insisted municipalities count paper ballots by hand.</p>
<p>Unlike the 2009 Gatineau civic election, the 2005 race that catapulted Bureau into the mayor's chair offered voters a simple choice between two candidates. Voters then chose Bureau, a shy, soft-spoken former used bookstore owner instead of the incumbent, Yves Ducharme, who was criticized for consulting only a few close advisers and travelling to exotic destinations such as Cambodia, Brazil and Morocco.</p>
<p>During this campaign, Bureau ran against five opponents, each accusing him of failing to provide leadership and accomplishing little for taxpayers.</p>
<p>Bureau brushed off criticism from Robert Labine, a former mayor of the old city of Gatineau, who said Bureau could win only by splitting the vote six ways.</p>
<p>"If I win it will be my victory on the field with my people and my ideas," Bureau said. "People will vote for someone who has the experience and a balanced program.</p>
<p>"I have 10 years of experience and I know all the people at the NCC, the provincial government and I am president of the big cities caucus in Quebec."</p>
<p>Cannavino, the 56-year-old former president of the Canadian Police Association and the Sûreté du Québec provincial police association, argued he would provide the leadership missing on council. Desjardins, a former deputy mayor, had been councillor for Lac Beauchamp district since 1999.</p>

</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador has recorded its first swine flu-related death, health officials said Sunday. The Central Health authority said a 36-year-old woman from central Newfoundland passed away Saturday from complications of an H1N1 infection. The health authority said the woman had an underlying medical condition and that out of respect for her family no further information with respect to the patient would be released. This would be the 96th confirmed H1N1-related death in Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospital staff bring family to workplace vaccine clinic; 'Do we turn them away?': Officials confront ethical dilemma</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1037 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Officially, the weekend vaccination clinic at The Ottawa Hospital was aimed at the 13,000 staff who work at the region's largest health-care provider -- and are among those at the front of the line for the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>After all, if the hospital's doctors, nurses, support staff and administrators fall sick during a pandemic, it could hobble the entire system.</p>
<p>But when word of the weekend clinic got out, some hospital employees brought along their family members, many of whom had been turned away from long lineups at the vaccination clinics run by the city's public-health department.</p>
<p>The situation created a dilemma for the hospital.</p>
<p>"We knew ... that we were probably going to be confronted with situations of people showing up at the door of our clinic, not only with themselves but with their family members," said Nicolas Ruszkowski, The Ottawa Hospital's vice-president of communications and outreach.</p>
<p>"The ethical question you ask yourself is: Do we turn them away or do we take them? And the ethical decision that we made was we're not going to turn anybody away as long as we know that we're covering our staff."</p>
<p>Ruszkowski said he doesn't know how many of the 8,495 people who got their pandemic flu shot over the weekend were relatives of hospital staffers. But he said the hospital carefully weighed the benefits of extending the vaccine to employees' families before making the decision.</p>
<p>"You can reduce absenteeism among your health-care workforce if they're coming to work instead of being at home, caring for their sick husband, sick wife, sick children," said Ruszkowski.</p>
<p>And so while Ottawa's six H1N1 clinics struggled to inoculate 6,800 people on Saturday, The Ottawa Hospital quietly vaccinated nearly 3,400 -- the result of a mass effort by up to 600 hospital employees, who volunteered to run a workplace vaccination clinic at the hospital's Riverside campus.</p>
<p>Among them were nurses giving flu shots, support staff and administrators handling paperwork and pharmacists loading syringes with vaccine -- all of whom formed a briskly efficient assembly line.</p>
<p>By Sunday, the hospital had immunized another 5,000 -- a pace that rivals that of the six public clinics on their better days. "We have a built-in infrastructure and advantage at the hospital. It's probably not fair to compare us to public health," said Ruszkowski.</p>
<p>Yet as the public vaccination clinics head into their second week, with little sign that demand will let up, the city's public-health department is scrambling to find more people to give the pandemic flu shot.</p>
<p>The long lineups outside clinics that characterized the first week have been a mixed blessing for officials, who are gratified that people are taking their flu-prevention message to heart.</p>
<p>But the unexpected surge in demand has also pushed public-health workers to the limit. Even with almost all of the department's 475 employees reassigned to the vaccination effort, the clinics are still perpetually short-staffed.</p>
<p>The staffing crunch is one reason health officials say they are hampered from opening more clinics. In particular, school-based clinics are not considered practical given that they require more staff than is available, yet target only a small portion of those considered at high risk of getting swine flu.</p>
<p>"We've already exceeded capacity," Dr. Isra Levy, the city's medical officer of health, said in a weekend interview. "I mean, we've already redeployed the entire workforce now, even deeper than the original plan of 70 per cent."</p>
<p>To bulk up the workforce, Levy has hired more temporary nurses and redeployed "every available vaccinator we have found in the city," including those paramedics who are, for whatever reason, on leave from frontline duty.</p>
<p>Up to a dozen paramedics have been assigned at each of the bigger clinics to augment the 15 or so nurses giving the shots. As a result, the city's six clinics have been vaccinating between 4,200 to 8,550 people a day. On Sunday, the clinics gave 8,500 vaccinations.</p>
<p>"In order to vaccinate more people, our clinics need more trained professionals to work as vaccinators," Levy said in a memo to city staff issued on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We have also put out a call for trained personnel to work as vaccinators -- a call that many have answered. However, we continue to see a lack of capacity that makes it impossible to vaccinate more people than are already being served through our clinics."</p>
<p>Since the vaccination program began last Monday, the total number of immunizers has doubled from 70 to 140. For every frontline nurse, paramedic or doctor giving the needle, an additional two or three support workers are needed to triage patients and enter computer data about who is getting the shots.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, dozens of staff from the city's parks and recreation department were brought in to help manage crowds at the clinics, freeing up more public-health staff to handle other duties.</p>
<p>But with the clinics running seven days a week and staff needing some days off, officials are finding it a challenge to set up shift schedules for weeks at a time, Levy said.</p>
<p>"We only have about a 24-hour ability to predict and forecast staffing. And we have a lot of holes in our scheduling because there are just so many people available, many of them are staying late to get as many people vaccinated as possible and people are starting to get tired."</p>
<p>At the Kanata Recreation Complex, one of the city's busiest clinics, about 16 vaccinators were on hand to inoculate 1,200 people on Sunday. Over the past week, many of the clinic's staff have stayed until 11 p.m., well past the 8:30 p.m. closing time, to finish their vaccinations.</p>

<div>358 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Hedy Fry, the Liberal MP for Vancouver Centre, suggested on Thursday that members of Parliament should get their own H1N1 clinic on Parliament Hill-- which presumably would allow MPs and their staff to receive the swine-flu vaccine on a priority basis, ahead of ordinary citizens. Her reasoning? "MPs are at risk:We shake hands with people I don't know how many times a day."</p>
<p>Here's a simple solution, Ms. Fry: Stop shaking hands and get in line like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Ms. Fry seems to believe that elected representatives are on par with those professionals whose work truly does put them at significantly heightened risk of contracting the virus, such as doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>We are grateful for those Canadians who stand for office and perform valuable public service, but they must guard against the self-delusion that they somehow constitute an upper caste worthy of preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we are pretty certain Ms. Fry is alone in her belief that MPs should be jumped to the head of the vaccine queue. For instance, on Friday morning, Ms. Fry's boss, Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, sensibly twittered: "I'll be getting my H1N1 vaccine after priority groups have had theirs first."</p>
<p>This is far from the first absurdity to stumble out of Ms. Fry's mouth. She has been a gaffe machine for years --claiming, most famously, that Canada was suffering an epidemic of cross burnings. More recently, she championed the conspiracy theory that the symbol festooning some of our Olympic athletes' clothing was secretly designed to resemble the Conservative party's logo.</p>
<p>Were Hedy Fry a member of the Tory government, the Liberals and the bulk of the media would by now have labelled her a "wing nut," and pressured the Tories to expel her from caucus. But because she is a Liberal -- and perhaps, too, because she is an MP of colour-- Ms. Fry gets a free pass to continue spewing her claptrap.</p>
<p>If only there were a vaccine against weird outbursts, Ms. Fry would indeed be entitled to jump to the head of the queue.</p>

<p>CALGARY -- Alberta's health minister denies his government made mistakes in the way it rolled out its H1N1 vaccination program, despite public anger and calls for his resignation.</p>
<p>Due to a national shortage of the vaccine, Alberta moved Saturday to temporarily suspend clinics across the province.</p>
<p>Ron Liepert said Sunday it was not a mistake to vaccinate everyone who showed up at clinics during the first week of the campaign, saying "(that's) 400,000 Albertans who won't need to access our emergency (rooms) and our hospitals."</p>

<p>Vaccine experts say it is unnecessary to delay giving seasonal flu shots this year, and that provinces and territories should offer the shots as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Some unpublished Canadian studies suggest getting a seasonal flu shot can raise your risk of catching a mild case of H1N1.</p>
<p>But Dr. Joanne Langley, chair of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, says even if the studies are right, the increased risk is smaller than the risk of not protecting people against seasonal flu viruses.</p>
