<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Public Safety Canada, the agency charged with co-ordinating the federal response to threats such as the H1N1 flu, has yet to complete its emergency plan, the auditor general says.</p>
<p>Two years after Parliament gave the department responsibility for emergency management leadership, a formal plan has yet to be finished and approved.</p>
<p>There is growing political and public anger over H1N1, as thousands flock to overwhelmed clinics for flu shots -- but there's no overall federal plan for emergencies, be they pandemics, floods, blackouts or terror attacks.</p>
<p>In the latest of her periodic reports to Parliament, Auditor General Sheila Fraser said yesterday that Public Safety is supposed to ensure that federal departments work together in emergencies.</p>
<p>"The aim is to eliminate the potential for confusion when responding in a crisis and provide a federal point for co-ordination," says the report.</p>
<p>Instead, the department is still drafting the policies and rules that would define what it's supposed to do and how it's supposed to do it.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan said substantial progress has been made in producing a formal emergency plan.</p>
<p>"Our plans continue to be prepared," he said. "We've worked well with the provinces and the territories, our co-ordination has worked well, as we saw this spring with the floods in Manitoba and we will continue to improve and enhance and build our emergency management capacity."</p>
<p>Fraser complained that the cabinet has yet to sign off even on the draft plans that exist.</p>
<p>It has also fallen short on the issues of cybersecurity and protecting critical infrastructure -- railways, pipelines, power plants and the like.</p>
<p>"We found that Public Safety Canada has not exercised the leadership necessary to co-ordinate emergency management activities, including protection of critical infrastructure."</p>
<p>There is also a gap on the emergency front line. Public Safety is working on standards for things such as protective gear for police and firefighters and for equipment, such as heavy search-and-rescue vehicles.</p>
<p>But there are still serious communications problems. Police, fire and ambulance services often can't communicate with each other or across jurisdictions. The department said it is trying to help these agencies develop their own standards.</p>
<p>By and large, the department agreed with Fraser's criticisms and has promised improvements.</p>
<p>Fraser's report also urged the government to get the Income Tax Act up to date with a series of technical changes, both to close loopholes and to make it easier for taxpayers to understand the rules.</p>
<p>She cited the example of non-compete agreements, by which part of the selling price of a company is linked to the seller's agreement not to compete with the new owner. Disgraced newspaper mogul Conrad Black collected large sums in non-compete agreements before he ran afoul of U.S. authorities and was sent to prison.</p>
<p>These payments were supposed to be taxable, but court decisions in 2000 and 2003 said they were generally not subject to tax. The Finance Department said in 2003 it would change the law to make it clear that taxes were due on such payments. However, that change -- along with 150 or so other technical changes to the tax law -- has never been passed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>MD offices ease vaccine rush; Doling out 20,000 H1N1 shots</b>

</p>
<p>Doctors offices are busy rolling out flu shots after receiving almost 20,000 H1N1 vaccine doses from Hamilton's public health department.</p>
<p>Almost three-quarters of the city's 350 doctors had the vaccine by yesterday, substantially reducing lineups at public health clinics across the city, although crowds still formed before clinics opened.</p>
<p>Some offices reported being flooded with calls for the H1N1 shot. While some made appointments, others set aside specific hours to immunize patients.</p>
<p>The vaccine is still only available to high-risk groups -- including pregnant women, children under five, health-care workers, and those under 65 with medical conditions.</p>
<p>Associate medical officer of health Dr. Chris Mackie advised patients who can't get in to their doctors or who prefer the public health clinics but can't stand in long lineups to attend clinics in late afternoon or evenings, when lines start to clear.</p>
<p>At Dr. Richard Tytus' office yesterday, four-year-old Noah Drzewicki was the first patient to receive the vaccine. Tytus, who has about 100 doses, is setting up a clinic for his own patients, but also administering the vaccine to any high-risk patients he sees before then.</p>
<p>Noah's mother Beata brought in his little sister, who is sick, and because Noah had to tag along, Tytus said it was a good opportunity to give him the shot. Beata, pregnant and caring for her three small children, would find it difficult to line up for hours to get them immunized.</p>
<p>"This is the ideal scenario" because patients with chronic conditions often can't stand more than 30 minutes, said Tytus, president of the Hamilton Academy of Medicine representing the city's family doctors. "There's a certain amount of comfort level in coming to the doctor's office ... There's also a huge trust factor."</p>
<p>Noah, a brave boy who was obviously comfortable with Tytus, grimaced briefly when taking the vaccine, then announced "it hurt only a little bit."</p>
<p>Dr. Norman Chan's office, which got about 100 doses, was inundated with calls yesterday from patients wanting the shot, while medical secretary Freda Giaintzis tried to reach pregnant patients and those with young children to give them priority.</p>
<p>"I think every patient has called me," she said.</p>
<p>Ontario's chief medical officer of health Dr. Arlene King said lineups across Ontario are much better this week, but also suggested people call their doctors because hundreds have or will receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>But some local doctors say this is unfair because not all have the vaccine.</p>
<p>At Dr. Peter Loveless' office, medical secretary Adrienne Ziemer was also flooded with calls, but the office has no vaccine yet.</p>
<p>There are fears the city's 81,500 provincially allotted doses could run out this weekend.</p>
<p>King doesn't know when Ontario will get its next shipment, but said the H1N1 vaccine "provides good protection" even if given in December since seasonal flu usually peaks in January and February.</p>
<p>The federal government has said all Canadians who want a shot will have one by December.</p>
<p>Halton Region now reports almost no lineups at their clinics --wait times at each were posted and updated every hour on the region's website. Public health staff also opened clinics up to two hours early if there were lineups.</p>

</p>
<p>ALL 12 of Winnipeg's flu clinics will reopen today after health officials discovered they had more doses of the vaccine than they thought.</p>
<p>The clinics will be open today and Thursday from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. to vaccinate people at high risk of becoming severely ill from H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The opening comes just a day after flu clinics were temporarily suspended Tuesday when Winnipeg health officials ran short of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Regional Health Authority spokeswoman Heidi Graham said officials discovered extra doses were returned to the health region after clinics shut down. The doses were left over from clinics to immunize health-care workers and children. Children only require half a dose of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Winnipeg has 12,000 doses of the normal vaccine and 4,300 doses of vaccine without adjuvant, which is designed for pregnant women.</p>
<p>People who can receive the shot at this stage are children aged six months to five years, anyone of aboriginal ancestry, people under 55 with a chronic medical condition or other risk factor, and pregnant women.</p>
<p>Graham said Winnipeg expects to receive another shipment of 8,000 doses of vaccine before the end of the week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>First Nations lining up for shots - 24,000 have received H1N1 vaccination in last week, grand chief says</b>

</p>
<p>While vaccinations were temporarily halted in Winnipeg, Manitoba First Nations residents are still lining up for the shot.</p>
<p>Grand Chief Ron Evans said nearly 24,000 of the 84,000 who live on Manitoba reserves received the H1N1 vaccine in the last week. Evans said remote communities still have adequate supply, and will continue to offer the shot at nursing stations.</p>
<p>Remote Manitoba First Nations were caught off guard by the spread of severe H1N1 influenza last spring, and dozens of sick patients were flown to Winnipeg and put on ventilators in intensive care units. The outbreak confirmed the worst fears of First Nation leaders who warned impoverished aboriginal reserves are ill-equipped to deal with widespread infections.</p>
<p>Evans said people are lining up to protect themselves this time around, and hopes that more First Nations will get the vaccine in the coming weeks. He suspects the recent death of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio in Ontario has also encouraged people to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"We're over a quarter of the way," Evans said. "Given that we've just started I think that's pretty good."</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point took drastic measures to ensure people at risk of falling severely ill with H1N1 got the shot.</p>
<p>Chief David McDougall said the remote community cancelled school classes for four days last week, so children and their parents could receive the H1N1 shot together at the nursing station. The idea worked, and McDougall said 2,000 of the reserve's 3,500 were vaccinated in the last week.</p>
<p>The first cluster of severe H1N1 cases surfaced in the isolated fly-in community, located 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. During the peak of the first wave, between 300 and 400 people were sick, and close to 40 people with symptoms of severe respiratory illness were flown to Winnipeg, McDougall said.</p>
<p>One of McDougall's nieces died in hospital, and 22 others had confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>"After having experienced what we went through last spring we're taking it very seriously," he said. "We know what the disease can do."</p>
<p>At this point in the flu season, McDougall said there are no confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>"So far we've had a couple of alarm bells (with) people (thinking) they had H1N1."</p>

<p>Seven Winnipeg schools are among 27 Manitoba public schools reporting higher-than-usual absence levels Tuesday -- the first time this fall that schools within the city are reporting absence problems.</p>
<p>It's by far the highest number of absence problems since then-Education Minister Peter Bjornson ordered school divisions more than three weeks ago to post daily absence reports online for all schools.</p>
<p>The city schools are Viscount Alexander in Pembina Trails S.D.; Samuel Burland and Marion in Louis Riel S.D.; and Chief Peguis, John G. Stewart, Lord Wolseley, and Salisbury Morse Place in River East Transcona S.D.</p>
<p>Bjornson had directed school divisions to post disclaimers that absence levels are not necessarily an indication that H1N1 is involved.</p>
<p>Pembina Trails superintendent Lawrence Lussier said Viscount Alexander's principal will not be sending home a letter to parents. "We're following what the minister asked us to do to inform parents," by publishing the absenteeism information online, Lussier said.</p>
<p>"We continue to collect voluntary reports from parents and staff about flu-like illness," which the school division passes on to public health officials, Lussier said.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health has said repeatedly that it will not identify communities or institutions with a confirmed case of H1N1 unless there is a compelling public health reason to do so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, teachers at Ruth Betts School in Flin Flon have called on Premier Greg Selinger to make teachers a high priority for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"We work with children on a daily basis -- and children are (typically) not as concerned with covering their mouths or washing their hands. We have worked very hard at developing a plan within our school for a potential outbreak of H1N1, and also spent the past two months educating our children about the spread of germs, proper sneezing techniques, etc.," the school's teachers told Selinger.</p>
<p>"We want to know why we are not one of the first groups eligible for the H1N1 vaccine, especially since we are not allowed to close our schools," said the Flin Flon teachers.</p>
<p>The Manitoba Teachers' Society said no one was available to comment Tuesday.</p>

<p>As the sudden deaths of young children from H1N1 drive unprecedented demand for flu vaccine, a new study of the first 1,000 cases in California of H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths confirms the pandemic virus is disproportionately infecting and killing young people.</p>
<p>The study also shows obesity is emerging as a newly identified risk factor for severe H1N1. Of those adults whose body mass index, or BMI, was known, more than half - 58 per cent - were obese. Almost one-third did not have any other known condition that might increase their risk of dying from H1N1.</p>
<p>Overall, the report adds to growing evidence H1N1 is a different animal from regular seasonal flu, which normally is more dangerous to people over 65. The median, or midpoint age of hospitalized and fatal cases in California during H1N1's first wave was 27; 32 per cent were children younger than 18.</p>
<p>"If you're under the age of 50, this is a bad flu. This might be the worst flu experienced in 50 to 100 years," said Dr. Bela Matyas, acting chief of the emergency preparedness and response branch of the California Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>"If you are a teenager or younger, the chances of dying from this flu are much, much higher than any other flu we've seen maybe since the 1918 flu."</p>
<p>But while people age 50 and older are less likely to become infected, they are the ones most likely to die if hospitalized with H1N1.</p>
<p>The overall fatality rate was 11 per cent, but it was highest - 18 to 20 per cent - in people 50 and older. The mortality rate was one to five per cent in children under 18.</p>
<p>The study of 1,088 hospitalized and fatal H1N1 cases reported in California between April and August also shows:</p>
<p>- Fever, cough and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms, and a small number of patients arrived in emergency with "altered mental status" due to respiratory distress and hypoxia, or low oxygen.</p>
<p>- Most adults and more than one-third of children hospitalized required mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>- In a pattern rarely seen with regular flu, more than one-third of adults hospitalized with H1N1 reported nausea or vomiting, and one-fifth reported diarrhea. Normally, seasonal flu causes gastrointestinal symptoms in fewer than five per cent of cases.</p>
<p>- Babies under 2 months had the highest hospitalization rates, but are too young to receive the vaccine, underscoring the importance of vaccinating caregivers and close contacts of babies, the researchers said.</p>
<p>- Rapid flu tests missed one-third of infections; the tests came back "falsely negative" in 34 per cent of cases evaluated.</p>

</p>
<p>A single dose of swine flu vaccine produces a robust immune response in pregnant women, one of the groups at high risk of dying from H1N1 influenza, but young children need two shots, U.S. clinical trials have shown.</p>
<p>"The immune responses seen in healthy pregnant women are comparable to those seen in healthy adults at the same time point after a single vaccination, and the vaccine has been well tolerated," said Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>No safety issues were reported during the trials, which began on Sept. 9 and tested 120 women, all in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Twenty-one days after they were given the swine flu vaccine, 92 per cent of pregnant women who received a single 15-microgram dose and 96 per cent of expectant mothers who were given one 30-microgram dose showed a robust immune response, showed the initial results of the trials, which are still going on.</p>
<p>The findings of the trials back up recommendations made last week by the World Health Organization (WHO), that "adults - including pregnant women - and adolescents, beginning at 10 years old" be given a single swine flu shot.</p>
<p>Separate tests conducted in the United States have shown that children age 6 months to 35 months and 3 to 9 years should have two doses of the H1N1 vaccination, Fauci said.</p>
<p>"Those younger groups didn't have a good immune response eight to 10 days after receiving the first dose, and 21 days after that first dose their response was still suboptimal - 25 per cent for the very young group and 55 per cent for the intermediary group," Fauci told reporters Monday. "However, there was a very sharp increase in immune response after they received the second dose, such that 100 per cent of the younger group and 94 per cent of 3- to 9-year-olds gave a robust immune response eight to 10 days after the second dose. That's where we want them to be."</p>
<p>The WHO has urged national authorities that have made children a priority for early vaccination to administer "one dose of vaccine to as many children as possible" while waiting for the results of studies to determine what the optimal dosage is for young kids.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No plan for pandemic, auditor general says; Public Safety Canada is itself a disaster, Fraser charges</b>
</div><div>JANICE TIBBETTS and DAVID AKIN   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>625 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The federal department charged with disaster planning is itself a disaster when it comes to preparing for emergencies as varied as the swine flu pandemic, floods and terrorist attacks, auditor general Sheila Fraser says.</p>
<p>"We found that Public Safety Canada has not exercised the leadership necessary to coordinate emergency management activities," Fraser concluded in her latest report, tabled in the House of Commons yesterday.</p>
<p>Her department did not study the H1N1 crisis, but Fraser contends that had Public Safety Canada put pandemic management plans in place, there would have been less confusion.</p>
<p>"Certainly an approved plan would have clearly indicated what the role was for Public Safety Canada, what the roles of the other departments and the federal government would be, and would also have brought in the coordination with the provinces, municipalities and territories," she said.</p>
<p>The opposition parties seized on Fraser's findings in the House of Commons question period, blaming the long lineups for H1N1 immunizations and a vaccine shortage on the Conservative government's failure to have an organized plan. "Doesn't that begin to explain why the government's response to this crisis has been so slow and so confused?" said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff.</p>
<p>The Conservatives were also hammered for relying on a sole manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, for the vaccine. The federal government is responsible for buying the vaccine and distributing it to the provinces.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan replied that the government has a separate pandemic management plan in place, overseen by Health Canada, that should not be confused with the Public Safety Department's more general role to oversee national disasters. He stressed that the federal government plays only a coordinating role in emergency preparedness and that disaster and emergency management "is primarily a provincial issue."</p>
<p>In her report, Fraser highlighted not only H1N1 but also SARS, the 2003 eastern seaboard power blackout, massive flooding and terrorist threats as examples of emergencies that fall under the coordination of the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. The department, created in 2003, has yet to finalize a Federal Emergency Response Plan and appears to be offering no guidance to other federal departments in developing their own sub-plans, the auditor concluded.</p>
<p>Fraser was also critical of Citizenship and Immigration Canada after finding that some temporary workers are getting into Canada after work permits have been issued for jobs or employers that do not exist.</p>
<p>Fraser's auditors also said they were disappointed to find that there was no evidence that changes the governing Tories made to Canada's immigration system were helping to meet Canada's skills shortages. Moreover, the temporary foreign worker program is inefficient and ineffective, and that could leave foreign workers in a vulnerable position.</p>
<p>In addition, Fraser found that Canada's foreign aid system is a mess, with millions of dollars being spent in a haphazard way with little guidance on priorities or policy direction. Despite promises by the Conservative government to narrow the focus of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), it has yet to do so, Fraser found, and that has imperiled the effectiveness of Canada's foreign aid.</p>
<p>Fraser also looked at four procurement projects that were "fast-tracked" at the Defence Department to get tanks and armoured vehicles to Afghanistan. Fraser found that in three of the projects, the new gear got to the soldiers in time but the paperwork was not handled correctly. The fourth project, involving a weapons system for a light armoured vehicle, is running at least double its original $55-million budget and is nearly two years behind schedule.</p>

</p>
<p>The chamber orchestra I Musici de Montréal has cancelled a concert for the first time in the 25-year history of the organization after a majority of its 15 musicians contracted salmonella on a recent tour of China.</p>
<p>"It"s not a serious concern and has absolutely nothing to do with the H1N1 virus," Christine Roy, the orchestra"s communications coordinator, said in an email. "Let's just say some musicians are visiting the toilet more often than others."</p>
<p>The concert, part of the orchestra's main Montreal subscription season, was a program of Czech repertoire to be given tomorrow in Pollack Hall. Roy said there were no plans to reschedule the concert, although the program might be given next season.</p>
<p>A few musicians started showing symptoms in Beijing during the last two days of the trip, which ended on Oct. 25. Most developed symptoms on the return flight to Montreal. Roy said no one knows the source of the illness.</p>
<p>Music director Yuli Turovsky - himself affected - is taking the setback in his stride, so to speak. "Salmonella sounds almost like Saltarella or Tarantella and requires almost as much running," was his comment yesterday, also delivered by email.</p>
<p>Roy said the problematic conclusion of the seven-city tour should not be permitted to obscure its success. "Public attendance was great. Mr. Turovsky signed CDs after the concert in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Holders of tickets for tomorrow"s concert are encouraged to exchange them for a future event. Call 514-982-6038.</p>

<div>Editorial / Op-Ed</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Your Constitution and the flu; Ottawa is responsible for supply while the provinces control the delivery</b>
</div><div>L. IAN MACDONALD   </div>
<div>FREELANCE</div>
<div>734 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A25</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Beyond the anxiety in the country and the blame game in Ottawa over the availability of H1N1 vaccine, there's a fundamental issue of the constitutional division of powers.</p>
<p>It's both simple and subtle. Under Section 91 of the Constitution Act, Ottawa is responsible for "peace, order and good government." It is the central statement of the Constitution, and the ultimate trump of the federal government in running the country.</p>
<p>This means that Ottawa is ultimately responsible for the safety and well-being of Canadian citizens, including those standing in line waiting for flu shots. Except that the lines are run by the provinces.</p>
<p>Ottawa is also responsible for national health and safety standards, approvals for experimental drugs, and the purchase of drugs such as the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>But the provinces, under Section 92 of the Constitution, are responsible for running the health-care systems across the country, including the distribution of vaccine and the determination of priorities.</p>
<p>In other words, Ottawa is responsible for assuring the supply, while the provinces are responsible for meeting the demand.</p>
<p>As the lineups across the country have demonstrated in the last week, this is a work in progress at both levels of government. The manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, is making the stuff as fast as it can, but the surge in demand exceeds the supply for the moment. In spite of all its precautions, Ottawa is playing catch-up. There's a lot of pent-up anxiety, and even some incipient panic.</p>
<p>But the media, which have played a role in this, would do well not to underestimate the capacity of Canadians for calm and patience, as long as they see that health-care professionals and providers are doing the best they can under trying circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, Quebec appears to have done a good job in publicizing priorities in at-risk groups and locations where they can be served across the administrative regions of the province.</p>
<p>For Quebec, the priority groups on the island of Montreal include parents of children under 6 months of age, who are asked to visit any one of 15 locations beginning this Friday.</p>
<p>Starting next Monday, it will be the turn of pregnant women and children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Beginning the following week, persons under 18 years old suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, will also be eligible. Beginning the week of Nov. 23, persons from 18 to 65 years of age suffering from chronic diseases are invited to the clinics, which by then will have expanded to 20 locations island-wide. Finally, from Dec. 7, children and adults over the age of 5 and in good health will be able to join the line.</p>
<p>But that's just on the island of Montreal. On the South Shore and in the Monterégie, the priority criteria appear slightly different, so check your local newspaper!</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the political class doesn't seem to be checking much of anything, except checking its common sense at the door.</p>
<p>For example, the production line at <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> was stopped and restarted to enable the production of unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, understandably concerned about the effects of the higher doses of the adjuvanted version on their unborn children.</p>
<p>But the World Health Organization, which had advised pregnant women to get the unadjuvanted shot, especially in the first term, reversed itself on Monday and declared there was no risk from the higher dosage.</p>
<p>But in the House, the blame game goes on. The Liberals asked for an emergency debate on the pandemic Monday night, and their leader, Michael Ignatieff, gave quite an impassioned address on the role and responsibilities of the national government. But while he was doing his job, his operatives were undermining him.</p>
<p>The national president of the Liberal Party, an Iggyite named Alf Apps, put out an hysterical missive comparing the H1N1 situation to Hurricane Katrina. Then one of Ignatieff's advisers named Mark Sakamoto turned up as an ordinary concerned Canadian in an interview on CBC's The National, which was not a good thing for either him or them.</p>
<p>This is a grown-up moment we're living in, one in which the Liberals are in need of adult supervision.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Coupons to cut lineups; Wait at home until it's time for your shot</b>
</div><div>KEVIN DOUGHERTY, MAX HARROLD   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>887 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>In a bid to bring order to the H1N1 vaccination process and dispel fears of a shortage, public health officials are to start handing out coupons to end the long lineups that are an embarrassment to the Quebec government.</p>
<p>The number of coupons handed out each day will correspond to the number of doses of vaccine available that day.</p>
<p>Health Minister Yves Bolduc said the coupon system will be introduced in some parts of the province today and in Montreal tomorrow for parents of children under 6 months, people with immune deficiencies who can be vaccinated and the families of people with immune deficiencies who can't be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, pregnant women, who will receive a non-adjuvanted vaccine, and children 6 months to 5 years old can be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The adjuvant, or boosted vaccine, produces more antibodies and is judged as high as 98 per cent effective. Pregnant women get the non-adjuvanted version, with a dose that's four times higher.</p>
<p>Bolduc said vaccination centres would open as early as 6 a.m. to distribute coupons, even though the inoculations begin only at noon.</p>
<p>"I hope people don't come at 3 a.m.," Bolduc told reporters at a briefing on the pandemic.</p>
<p>The minister said people eligible for a shot on a given day can get a coupon giving the approximate time at which they'll be vaccinated, so they can wait at home rather than standing in line for their flu shot.</p>
<p>Bernard Drainville, the Parti Québécois health critic, said his party would go ahead with a motion today condemning the government for the "confusion, chaotic management and inadequate planning" of the vaccination campaign, calling the coupon program "an admission of failure."</p>
<p>Dr. Alain Poirier, Quebec's public health director, said all those who want a shot will be vaccinated by Christmas, and while he understands the concern of parents, which is "not abnormal," the delay is not that significant.</p>
<p>Poirier noted that to date no children have died in Quebec from H1N1, adding that the health-care system has the resources to deal with children who contract the disease and the health department has set up six flu clinics.</p>
<p>Another 57 patients have been admitted to hospital with H1N1 since the last briefing on Saturday, but the public health director said there has been "no explosion" of the disease.</p>
<p>Poirier said that when Municipal Affairs Minister Laurent Lessard calls in the mayors of Quebec's nine largest cities next week to talk about corruption in the construction industry, the response to H1N1 will also be on the agenda.</p>
<p>The government knew there would be fewer doses available this week because GlaxoSmithKline Inc., which makes all the vaccine for Canada at its Quebec City plant, was producing the non-adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women.</p>
<p>But Poirier said the number of doses available next week in Quebec will be even less than the 152,000 this week.</p>
<p>On the positive side, public health officials now say children under 10 only need one half dose, not two half doses, as was originally thought.</p>
<p>Dr. Yolaine Galarneau told reporters that people calling the 8-1-1 Info-Santé line should first take the temperature of the person suspected of having H1N1 and should have Quebec's widely distributed self-care guide and a pencil and paper available to write the Info-Santé nurse's instructions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Quebec's College of Physicians said the government's H1N1 vaccinations program is making the best of a bad situation.</p>
<p>"I just came back from the United States, and they are having the same problems," college president Yves Lamontagne said.</p>

<p>Dear Sharon: I don't understand the ethics of giving health-care workers the H1N1 vaccine before the rest of society. It's as though certain professions are deemed more equal than the rest of us. G.</p>
<p>Dear G.: There is no easy way to answer this question. We need to address it using the best philosophical approaches known to us.</p>
<p>First, proponents of individual rights would argue that we are all equal, so the vaccine should be given on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>Second, utilitarians would allocate the limited vaccine to members of society who benefit the greatest number of people. Since health-care workers are saving large numbers of people from sickness and death, they deserve first shot at the shot.</p>
<p>Third, justice-based theorists would argue the distribution of benefits and burdens should be fair, and the groups bearing the greatest burden of this pandemic be reaping the greatest benefit from it, too. Since health-care workers put themselves and their families at the highest level of risk, they deserve first place in line.</p>
<p>Fourth, the ethics of care tells us we need to protect the vulnerable, and that the young and medically vulnerable groups should have the first vaccines.</p>
<p>It seems the government tried to exercise individual rights first. When the supply diminished, they appropriately changed their strategy to a utilitarian, justice and caring one.</p>

<p>High fives, low fives or any gesture of "giving skin" should be left hanging, according to the B.C. Lions.</p>
<p>Head coach Wally Buono has told his players to stop engaging others with their traditional greetings in an attempt to prevent the spread of sickness.</p>
<p>Slotback Geroy Simon, middle linebacker JoJuan Armour and defensive back Korey Banks were told to stay home from practice on Tuesday afternoon because of colds, sore throats and bronchitis and others who practised are showing some symptoms.</p>
<p>Receiver Paris Jackson, who is resting a sore knee, said he is feeling "nervous" about his own health status because of body aches, one of the symptoms of a cold or flu.</p>
<p>"Geroy started to get pretty sick on Sunday," Jackson said.</p>
<p>Medical trainer Bill Reichelt, however, said there has been only one confirmed case of the H1N1 virus-- reserve offensive lineman Damane Duckett. Reichelt said Duckett was told to stay away for seven days until he was symptom-free. He was back at practice on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We're putting a lot of guys on Tamiflu (an anti-viral medication) because we don't want to take any chances, especially with guys who have asthma," Reichelt said.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the media reported that H1N1 cases are now "peaking" in Alberta --this just days after the start of the immunization campaign. Since it takes 10 to 14 days to develop immunity, how many Albertans are now sick, or will be in the days to come, even though they were vaccinated?</p>
<p>My asthmatic son and I received flu shots on the first day, yet we are both home sick with H1N1. We were either exposed before, during or shortly after our shots. How many Albertans may have potentially been exposed in one of those horribly mismanaged lineups? What about those high-risk Albertans who are still waiting? Is it already too late for many of them?</p>
<p>The government has no excuse. It had plenty of time to prepare for this second round of H1N1. Obviously, immunizations should have started much earlier. What a waste of time, effort and precious vaccine!</p>

<p>I have been in Edmonton since Friday and have been reading your H1N1 coverage with interest. I cannot help but wonder at the manner in which the Alberta government has been rolling out its H1N1 program. It seems to me that very little planning was carried out.</p>
<p>I have only my own province's program with which to compare it; in Newfoundland and Labrador, the department of health has been planning the distribution of the H1N1</p>

<p>I can relate to the frustration and concern that Amanda Villetard must be feeling. My 11-year-old asthmatic brother just dealt with a bout of flu (the normal kind) and gave my family quite a scare.</p>
<p>That being said, in this entire gong show of a vaccination program, the only part I completely agree with is the vaccination of the homeless, who most definitely are a high-risk group. Villetard is taking out her frustration on a group that has always been a scapegoat for society.</p>
<p>The flu is know to most adversely affect those with already compromised immune systems. Your immune system can be compromised by stressors like and poor nutrition. The homeless often don't get three meals a day, they don't sleep in heated rooms, and many of them have pre-existing conditions that make them vulnerable to infectious.</p>
<p>Once H1N1 has entered the homeless population, with the coming winter weather, they are going to be crammed into shelters to survive at night. There's no better place for a virus to spread.</p>
<p>Yes the Alberta government messed up delivery of the vaccine to the public because their vaccination program did not focus on the most at risk groups. But if selfish individuals who are not high risk had stayed home and let those people who actually need the vaccine the most get it, we'd all be better off.</p>
<p>So blame the government for making the vaccine inaccessible to those high-risk groups who actually needed it. Blame the selfish cowards who got their vaccinations despite being low-risk. Don't blame the homeless for being the targets of a targeted vaccination program that actually worked.</p>

<p>Re: "Priorities all wrong for H1N1 vaccination," by Amanda Villetard, Letters, Nov. 2.</p>
<p>I sympathize with Amanda Villetard's concern for the health of her children and frustration with the government's handling of H1N1 vaccinations. However, her comment regarding a homeless person's right to the vaccination-- "These people don't even pay taxes"--is not only elitist, but also illogical.</p>
<p>If access to the H1N1 vaccine was based on paying taxes, the homeless would not be the only people turned away from clinics. According to the Canada Revenue Agency, the last three convictions for tax-related offences in Alberta involved the director of a company, a stockbroker and a businessman.</p>
<p>The working homeless work. They pay taxes. For whatever reason, they are not able to keep a roof over their heads. Should they be denied access to the vaccine?</p>
<p>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equality for every Canadian, whether they are in a position to pay taxes or not.</p>
<p>Those of us who are fortunate enough to have homes and families who advocate on our behalf are not above those who struggle with life on the street. If homeless people are high risk for H1N1, they are entitled to the same level of care by our health system as any other high-risk group.</p>

<p>The federal department charged with disaster planning is itself a disaster when it comes to preparing for emergencies as varied as the swine flu pandemic, floods and terrorist attacks, says Auditor General Sheila Fraser.</p>
<p>"We found that Public Safety Canada has not exercised the leadership necessary to co-ordinate emergency management activities," Fraser concluded in her latest report, tabled in the House of Commons on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her department did not study the current H1N1 crisis, but Fraser believes that had Public Safety Canada put pandemic management plans in place, there would have been less confusion.</p>
<p>"Certainly an approved plan would have clearly indicated what the role was for Public Safety Canada, what the roles of the other departments and the federal government would be, and would also have brought in the co-ordination with the provinces, municipalities and territories," Fraser told reporters.</p>
<p>"So it's important--very important-- that the role and responsibilities of Public Safety Canada be agreed to and endorsed in these emergencies."</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan replied that the government has a separate pandemic management plan in place, overseen by Health Canada, that should not be confused with the Public Safety Department's more general role to oversee national disasters.</p>
<p>He stressed that the federal government only plays a co-ordinating role in emergency preparedness"</p>
<p>In her report, Fraser highlighted not only H1N1, but also severe acute respiratory syndrome, the 2003 eastern seaboard power blackout massive flooding and terrorist threats as examples of emergencies that fall under the co-ordination of the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p>The department, which was created in 2003, has yet to finalize a Federal Emergency Response Plan and appears to be offering no guidance to other federal departments in developing their own sub-plans, the auditor concluded.</p>

<p>Here's what some visitors to edmontonjournal.com</p>
<p>had to say about members of the Calgary Flames and their families jumping the queue to get the H1N1 vaccine: - The Flames organization shows once again that Flames can't be spelled without "me." When will the arrogance end?</p>
<p>--Jakester - I guess it pays to have the Alberta flag on your jersey.</p>
<p>--Drew - Not that I need it, but this is another reason to hate the calgary Flames.</p>
<p>--smd521 - Instead of getting mad at the fact the players had vaccines, why don't people demand that the vaccine be distributed the way the flu vaccine always was? It's not a big deal to do it that way, and schools, companies, fire halls, police stations could do their own. --Nancy - Pathetic. bus drivers should get it before pros. Absolutely ridiculous. Who drives these people from home to the doctor and back again after confirming the illness, in a confined space? --Karen - In true calgary Flames fashion, they cheat in hockey and they cheat in life.</p>
<p>-Adam - The whole two-tiered health care issue couldn't be more evident.</p>
<p>--DRE - As an asthmatic, I stood in line last week with my three-year-old son to get our shots. It was cold, snowing and we were outside for a good half of our three-hour wait time. Are you trying to tell me that a healthy adult male couldn't do the same? Jerks, plain and simple.</p>
<p>--Denise - I'm in a high-risk group and with a toddler, and I still cannot get vaccinated. can I sue the calgary Flames and Alberta health services if I get sick? --RS - Do you really expect the player to wait three hours in line and probably be expected to sign autographs to other people waiting in line? This would drive me nuts. This is a special exemption. --TomCat - It just goes to show that big-buck sports teams get priority over the average citizen, another class distinction screw-up.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Lone vaccine supplier not a handicap, feds say; 'We are doing better than any other country,' health minister says</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>706 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>

<p>Canada is in a better position with one H1N1 vaccine manufacturer than other countries with multiple suppliers, federal officials said Tuesday, but the door could be open to other companies in the future to get a piece of the pandemic vaccine pie.</p>
<p>Canada's H1N1 vaccine is made exclusively by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> at its Ste-Foy, Que., factory and questions are being raised about how wise it is to rely on just one company to supply enough vaccine for the entire population.</p>
<p>Doubts about the 10-year contract that the federal government and the company signed in 2001 stem from the reduced supply of vaccine available to the provinces and territories this week. Two million doses were expected this week but GSK "overstated" how much would be shipped out, according to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and about 400,000 doses were sent instead.</p>
<p>Despite long lines and health units having to adjust their immunization plans at the last minute to adjust for the shortfall, Aglukkaq said Canada is still rolling out its H1N1 vaccine better than any other country.</p>
<p>"The domestic supplier I think has worked very well in our favour," she told a news conference in Vancouver. "In Canada, we are doing better than any other country in producing vaccine on a per-capita basis with one company."</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said, however, that moving forward it will be considered whether there is an "additional advantage" to having another supplier to help "hedge our bets."</p>
<p>"That's something that we will come back to, to think about after we deal with what we've got now."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> also produces most of Canada's seasonal flu vaccine and, as directed by the federal government, had to finish making it first before starting the H1N1 vaccine. Another complication that resulted in the reduced amount of vaccine for this week is that the factory has one production line and was asked to make two versions of the vaccine. Switching from the vaccine with an adjuvant--a booster compound that improves the immune system's response to the vaccine-- to making one without for a period of time and then switching back to producing the adjuvanted vaccine caused a slowdown.</p>
<p>When the vaccine contract was up for grabs in 2001, pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur could not bid on it because it does not have a plant in Canada. It does, however, have a factory in Toronto that can bring in bulk vaccine from its American plant and package it.</p>
<p>Rob Van Exan, director of immunization policy for the company, recently told the House of Commons health committee that Canada should consider having a second pandemic vaccine supplier in order to maximize the security of its supply. "It's not to say that GSK is doing a lousy job," Van Exan told Canwest News Service in an interview this week. "Our position is about risk and, in the future, minimizing that risk by having two suppliers."</p>
<p>Flu vaccines are different than other vaccines because a new one is made every year to match whatever flu virus is circulating in a given year. There is more room for something to go wrong because of the variability, said Van Exan and the risk, in his opinion, should be spread around.</p>
<p>The vaccine contract with GSK was among the questions raised by Liberal MPs during an emergency debate on Monday night and they kept up their attack on the government's handling of the pandemic again Tuesday during question period.</p>
<p>As the political bickering over H1N1 continued, the death toll rose again. Three more British Columbians have died, health officials there said Tuesday, bringing the province's total to 15.The Public Health Agency of Canada reported Tuesday morning that the national death toll is at 101.</p>

<p>Alberta's health superboard launched a probe Tuesday into a decision to let the Calgary Flames jump the queue for the H1N1 vaccine, amid political charges that the move has rattled the integrity of the inoculation process.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services officials confirmed the vaccinations were provided by superboard staff on Friday, with doses given to players and their families, as well as some coaches and management with the NHL team.</p>
<p>The news sparked a board investigation into who made the decision and how the vaccine found its way to an off-site clinic separate from the ones where thousands of Albertans lined up for hours last Friday.</p>
<p>"It's not acceptable to us," said spokesman Roman Cooney. "We're apologizing on behalf of Alberta Health Services for a very serious error in judgment."</p>
<p>At the legislature, the controversial decision touched off a political furor.</p>
<p>Opposition parties blasted the immunization of Flames players ahead of high-risk Albertans. Both the Liberals and NDP said the incident underscores a failure of leadership in the province's handling of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"Hockey players are not at high risk for swine flu," NDP Leader Brian Mason said in question period. "Some pregnant women and young children now face a greater risk of very serious disease or even death because millionaire hockey players got a vaccine they did not urgently need."</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach was reluctant to comment on the matter until it's investigated. "If it has happened, then somebody has broken the rules, and we want to find out who it is because it is deplorable," he said.</p>
<p>Flames' captain Jarome Iginla noted the flu clinics were still open to the general public was when the team got the shots. Still, he understood why people would be upset.</p>
<p>"As players, we were following the medical protocol given to us," said Iginla, whose three young children also received the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Today we can see ... there's a shortage so, yeah, we can understand why people may be upset."</p>
<p>The developments came the same day the province rolled out its new plan to reopen flu clinics after closing them last weekend because of tight supplies of vaccine.</p>
<p>The hockey club confirmed it had arranged H1N1 vaccinations for players and their families, as well as some coaches and management.</p>
<p>President Ken King said the vaccinations were done under the direction of Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>"Given the information that we had at the time, we made a request," King said. "We felt that that request went through Alberta Health Services' system appropriately and it would seem now ... it is deemed to be otherwise."</p>
<p>With many angry Albertans venting at the hockey club and media outlets on Tuesday, King also moved to distance the players from the inoculation decision.</p>
<p>He said the organization and the medical staff felt the players should receive the vaccination given the risks associated with frequent physical contact, extreme exertion and busy travel schedule.</p>
<p>"Our players did not seek to avoid lineups, they did not seek special attention," King said.</p>
<p>Following news of the vaccination, Albertans inundated newspaper websites, with the majority expressing dismay at the decision.</p>
<p>One fan decided to unload his Flames season tickets on the Internet for face value, saying "due to the Calgary Flames recent actions regarding the H1N1 vaccine, I can no longer call myself a Flames fan."</p>
<p>Alberta's top public health officials moved to quell public anger that other wealthy residents might be skirting process, saying they're not aware of other groups receiving special access to H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate, and I can't defend it," said Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health with Alberta Health Services. "It's under investigation. We have to try to get to understand how it happened."</p>
<p>Cooney couldn't say who at Alberta Health Services approved the decision to vaccinate the Flames, but said nobody in the superboard executive or senior leadership was aware of the situation until Monday.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said he would reserve judgment until the probe is complete.</p>
<p>"We asked Alberta Health Services to get an answer," Liepert said. "I'm not going to jump to any conclusions, but when we get the answer, we'll deal with it."</p>
<p>Liberal Leader David Swann contended the Flames' vaccination speaks volumes of broader problems with Alberta's immunization rollout.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu fears halt Health Trust celebration</b>
</div><div>Eva Ferguson   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>343 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A s confusion, frustration and fear continue to swirl around the H1N1 pandemic, the Calgary Health Trust has postponed a media event over concerns about the virus.</p>
<p>A celebration of the $33 million the health trust raised over the past year to support health care in Calgary was to take place Tuesday at the Hotel Arts.</p>
<p>But CEO Patricia Nelson said the event will be rescheduled for a later time in an effort to prevent any further spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"With people hustling about an event like this, we just wanted to be responsible. And we thought, 'Let's postpone this until we are through flu season.'</p>
<p>"We're just being precautionary," Nelson said, adding she isn't aware of anyone at the health trust having contracted the virus yet.</p>
<p>The Calgary Health Trust provided more than $33 million to Alberta Health Services and the University of Calgary's faculty of medicine over the past year. The money was earmarked for a number of initiatives including construction of the new Southern Alberta Institute of Urology at the Rockyview Hospital.</p>
<p>Nelson said the trust hopes to reschedule the celebration event once more Albertans have been able to receive their vaccinations.</p>
<p>But with Calgary clinics set to reopen to high-risk groups on Thursday, it was still unclear as to when Alberta's healthy population would have access to vaccines. Health officials have estimated it could be sometime in December, but no specific dates have been set.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nelson said the Calgary Health Trust will forge ahead with other major events scheduled in the new year. They include the second annual Foothills Hospital Cabaret, featuring the Pointer Sisters, on Feb. 18, and the Funny Bone Comedy Night with Rick Mercer on April 1.</p>
<p>Funds raised at the cabaret will help purchase Western Canada's first specialized trauma operating room. The equipment will be used for the most critical and complex trauma cases across southern Alberta.</p>

<p>Licia Corbella echoed my sentiments when she noted the information has been as "clear as black (Halloween) makeup." Wednesday, when the radio listed who the "high risk only" clinic was for, I said to my husband, "I thought the over-65 crowd was not considered at risk, and really, who isn't at risk?" I would have had no problem waiting for my family to receive their immunizations, except the original information led us to believe all would receive the vaccination. If the guidelines had been clear, we would have waited our turn.</p>
<p>If it is a supply shortage, then call it such and proceed with the high-risk groups. Most citizens understand the concept of pregnant women, children and the infirm first, despite our fears surrounding this virus. Obviously, the supply chain should have mandated the distribution of the first available vaccines. My son is in his first economics class and he can easily grasp this concept. One would expect elected officials to have a clear handle on supply and demand. I find the Herald's coverage of the H1N1 pandemic to be informative, comprehensive and helpful. Kudos to your team.</p>

<p>Re: "Wanna get scared? Listen to Liepert for an hour," Licia Corbella, Opinion, Oct. 31.</p>
<p>I am considered high risk because I take methotrexate for arthritis that lowers my immune response. If I get ill, I will get very ill and may not be able to fight it off. My family doctor and my rheumatologist say I must have the H1N1 vaccine. I've tried six times. My husband and I drove at 1 p.m. Friday to Whitehorn where he had heard the lineups were not too long. They were closed when we arrived. Saturday, we struck out for Avenida at 5:30 a.m. The lineup was about 3,000 people long. Some had camped out all night with sleeping bags, chairs and so on. There is no way I can stand in such a long line with my swollen feet and limbs, although my husband was willing to stand in line for me while I waited in the car. We knew they would close the line before we made it close to the front. I am afraid, angry and frustrated. Government created this chaos because of a poll that showed 47 per cent of Canadians did not intend to have the vaccine. So, they went to work with their fearmongering tactics. The result was widespread panic and they don't have the resources to deal with the fallout. What are we to do?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stelmach may evade fallout from vaccine fiasco; Latest slip-up seen eroding support at leadership review</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete And Renata D'Aliesio   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>601 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Several Alberta Tory MLAs say Premier Ed Stelmach shouldn't face fallout at this weekend's leadership review over the government's controversial handling of the H1N1 flu vaccination rollout, although some party faithful want to see changes within his inner circle.</p>
<p>But political observers and other Progressive Conservative stalwarts-- including a former provincial health minister--believe the government's management of the inoculation program is the latest health care slip-up and could erode the premier's support at a mandatory leadership review during the PC convention in Red Deer.</p>
<p>The Tory government has delivered mixed messaging on the H1N1 flu vaccinations, with Health Minister Ron Liepert pleading for only highrisk patients to get inoculated, while Stelmach last week encouraged all Albertans to get the flu shot before clinics were temporarily suspended as vaccine supplies dwindled.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services will now only allow high-risk patients to get immunized when clinics reopen later this week. It's the latest policy headache for the premier, who has also faced criticism over the new royalty framework, government's financial management and politicians' pay.</p>
<p>"Will this make it easier?No," said Culture Minister Lindsay Blackett, a Calgary MLA, about public anger over the vaccination program.</p>
<p>"But I think at the end of the day we have to look at the totality of what the government is doing, and I think we've got a good case to say to Albertans that we've done a good job."</p>
<p>Stelmach has a long list of supporters who argue that the province isn't to blame for flu vaccination hiccups and that he'll snare a strong mandate from some 1,500 Tory delegates at the annual convention. Many members of the Calgary Conservative caucus -- including Len Webber, Teresa Woo-Paw, Moe Amery and Wayne Cao--predicted Stelmach will win resounding support in the leadership review.</p>
<p>The premier declined to reveal Tuesday what level of support he wants to receive from his party. Former provincial leader Ralph Klein has suggested Stelmach needs at least 70 per cent support to remain leader.</p>
<p>There's "no sense (trying to)guess or speculate," Stelmach said. "It's in the hands of the delegates."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Iris Evans said she doubts the premier will face any major backlash for the government's struggles in rolling out the flu vaccination program. "This is a national problem," Evans said. "I don't think the premier is going to be held accountable for this particular issue."</p>
<p>Liepert also suggested frustration with flu-shot waits won't affect the premier's leadership vote.</p>
<p>"I don't see this as an issue at all. I see this as a good-news, bad-news situation," the health minister said. "The good news clearly is that we have vaccinated I think on a per-capita basis more than any other province."</p>
<p>But Marv Moore, a former provincial health minister and veteran Tory campaign manager, said the flu shot program is just the latest health-care blunder.</p>
<p>Most Tories he knows in the Peace Country region of northwest Alberta "are not happy at all" with the premier and his government, said Moore, a former chairman of the region's health authority before it was replaced by the provincial superboard. "At the end of the day, there have been some pretty bad decisions and blunders made there in the course of the last year."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>New look of CBC News is great; Seriously! Here are ways it can be even better . . .</b>
</div><div>Alex Strachan   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>645 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>E7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>OK, OK. I could trot out the same old bromide about how much disdain I have for CBC News's new look, but what would be the point? I wouldn't be saying anything that hasn't been said already.</p>
<p>I could tell you how, on a scale of one to 10, I would rate it -- oh, I don't know, a "one"? -- but that would be obvious, too.</p>
<p>Truth is, the new look is great! Seriously. Why, I even read on some Torontonian's blog that his 15-year-old thought the new look looked kinda cool. Something about how it "moves more," or some such.</p>
<p>This is important. Because, as the great Stephen Colbert might say, I always look to a 15-year-old's judgment when assessing the news.</p>
<p>Here are some ways the new CBC News could be even better.</p>
<p>- A house band. It would liven things up even more. Myself, I suggest the prog-rock band Nosound -- please don't read too much into the name -- because they're, well, progressive. Of course, it could be a bit tricky, as they're Italian, and Giancarlo and the boys are reportedly locked away in a studio somewhere, working on their third album. But that's what satellites are for.</p>
<p>- Canned laughter for Rex Murphy. The man needs a laugh track. You never know when he's being ironic.</p>
<p>- A regular feature called Election Talk, or, if you prefer, Talk of an Election, a.k.a., We Predict an Election Real Soon. As in: "There'll be an election soon, because we say so. You heard it here first." Said feature should run on the hour, every hour.</p>
<p>- A regular feature called H1N1: What You Need to Know. Because, as we all know, hysteria sells. I suggest H1N1: What You need to Know run at the bottom of each half-hour, with Election Talk at the top of the hour.</p>
<p>- Less international news, more local. BBC World has got it completely wrong. The way to boost ratings and win the audience's respect is to pay more attention to petty crimes in one's own backyard, and ignore what's going on in, say, London, Paris or Rome. Unless there's a hockey game going on there.</p>
<p>- An in-studio pinata in the form of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Because it looks as if the man will be around for a while, like it or not, and nothing jazzes up a boring newscast quite like a little contrived mayhem. When the anchor-of-the-hour -- or anyone in the newsroom at the time -- comes across something she doesn't like, she can simply clobber the pinata with a boom mike and see what comes out.</p>
<p>- CBC News loves to ask eight-year-olds what they think about pressing events of the day. "We asked a group of kids what they think and this is what we found. The results may surprise you." Better yet, why not do away with that lame At Issue panel entirely and convene a nightly roundtable of eight-year-olds? CBC could cross-promote the segment with YTV. Or Treehouse, if they choose to "young down" their target demo.</p>
<p>- The anchors need to move around more. Give them clipboards, and that way they can move around the studio like actual free-range chickens move around.</p>
<p>- Take a page from Warner Bros. cartoons or Monty Python. When things slow down, or somebody on the screen says something especially irritating, why not drop an anvil on his head -- or better yet, have the set explode real good?</p>
<p>Colour Photo: Maybe CBC could include canned laughter --
especially for Rex Murphy, so we'll know when he's being ironic.

<p>The Alberta government is investigating how most players on the Calgary Flames -- along with some of their family members, coaching staff and management -- arranged to receive their H1N1 vaccine shots in private last week, while thousands of Albertans stood in the cold for hours to be inoculated.</p>
<p>Flames president Ken King said Tuesday the hockey club made arrangements for the team to have the shots last Friday at an off-site clinic within the public health system, a day before tight supplies spurred the Alberta government to restrict inoculations to only those deemed to be at greatest risk. The clinic was not one of those set up for the general public.</p>
<p>King said he believed that the inoculation procedure the Flames followed had gone through an Alberta Health Services process.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Alberta Health Services said if the Flames jumped the board's queue to get the shots it was a "mistake."</p>
<p>News of the Flames' queue-jumping is certain to spark outrage in Alberta, where short vaccine supplies and a questionable decision to offer the vaccine to all comers led to long waits and the province's decision to suspend vaccinations last week. Alberta's vaccine clinics will be reopened for high-risk patients only on Thursday.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said Tuesday the government would investigate the Flames' vaccine arrangement.</p>
<p>OVIE OUT TWO WEEKS: The coach of the Washington Capitals says he hopes Alex Ovechkin won't be sidelined more than two weeks with an upper-body strain.</p>
<p>Coach Bruce Boudreau spoke after Tuesday's practice. The NHL's two-time MVP did not take part but was more optimistic, saying maybe he'll come back this weekend.</p>
<p>On Monday, the team said Ovechkin was week-to-week after he was hurt in Sunday's overtime loss to Columbus. Ovechkin had an MRI and was expected to travel with the team while receiving treatment.</p>
<p>When asked if his team intentionally targeted Ovechkin on Sunday, Blue Jackets coach Ken Hitchcock didn't mince words.</p>
<p>"That would be correct. That's the name of the game. Why, is that against the rules now?" Hitchcock said.</p>
<p>Ovechkin has missed only four games -- just two because of injury -- since coming to the NHL in 2005.</p>
<p>SENS WANT MONEY BACK: The NHL confirmed Tuesday that Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk has filed a grievance against Dany Heatley.</p>
<p>Melnyk is seeking the return of the $4-million US signing bonus he was forced to give Heatley on July 1 after Heatley refused to accept a trade to the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
<p>The league's vice-president of media relations, Frank Brown, acknowledged that the grievance was filed, but wouldn't make any further comment.</p>
<p>The Senators also declined to comment and referred all questions to the league.</p>
<p>There wasn't an immediate comment from the National Hockey League Players' Association.</p>
<p>Heatley was finally traded to the San Jose Sharks on Sept. 12, ending a summer of speculation over the forward's future.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ignatieff's meeting with prince may be bit awkward</b>

<div>375 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>When Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff meets Prince Charles for talks next week during the future King of Canada's visit to Ottawa, the opposition leader may have to do some fast talking to explain his anti-monarchist views in 1992 at the time of Charles' separation from Princess Diana.</p>
<p>In the article, published originally in the U.K.'s Observer newspaper and later reprinted in the Montreal Gazette, Ignatieff -- then a leading British-based writer and broadcaster -- argued that the future of the monarchy looked "decidedly bleak" and that it was time for the British public to "regretfully but firmly decide enough is enough," and demand a republican-style government.</p>
<p>"We are being told to sympathize with the private grief of the tragic couple," Ignatieff wrote. "We are being asked to believe that the horrid tabloids are to blame. Buckingham Palace and No. 10 Downing Street smoothly assure us that the couple's private misery need have no constitutional implications.</p>
<p>"Enough of this nonsense. The Royal Family is not doing its job."</p>
<p>Ignatieff's 17-year-old thoughts on the subject of the monarchy arise in the midst of an 11-day, cross-Canada trip by Prince Charles and his second wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. The couple's itinerary includes a brief visit with Ignatieff on Nov. 10 during a three-day stop in Ottawa, the last leg of the royal visit.</p>
<p>But the royal visit also coincides with the H1N1 crisis, and Ignatieff spokesman Mike O'Shaughnessy said that problems with the national vaccination program -- not the state of Canada's constitutional monarchy -- are the Liberal leader's priority at the moment.</p>
<p>"The leader is focused on the issue of H1N1," the spokesman stated. "Right now, Canadians are worried about lines for flu shots, not lines of succession. This is not an issue Canadians are focused on." He added that Ignatieff "looks forward to his meeting with Prince Charles."</p>
<p>Ignatieff's published views at the time were strikingly blunt.</p>
<p>"Listening to the separation announcement, I found myself wondering exactly why this shambles was so magically preferable to an elected presidency," Ignatieff wrote at the time.</p>

<div>Issues & Ideas</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Should you get the H1N1 vaccine?; And if you can't get it right now, what you should do to keep your family safe</b>
</div><div>Lilah Rossi and Jane Hailey   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>999 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The short answer to the first question is a resounding Yes. This vaccine has about a 95 per cent protection rate against the H1N1 virus. If you experienced the flu before 1957, you may have been exposed to a similar virus and have some protection -- but don't count on it.</p>
<p>What's most frightening about this virus is that young, healthy people seem to be most vulnerable. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, and are considered high risk. If a pregnant woman gets very ill, both she and her fetus may be in grave danger. Yes, most people who get the flu have a self-limiting illness that resolves within a week.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus, however, seems to randomly cause severe respiratory distress in healthy people who would not normally be considered high risk. This can be life threatening. Hospitals are re-educating nurses about ventilator operation, and setting up extra hospital areas for patients who will need artificial breathing machines.</p>
<p>In Canada, there are two versions of the H1N1 vaccine available -- with and without adjuvant. This is causing confusion and concern, as most people have never heard of adjuvants. Deriving from the Latin word "adjuvans," which means to help, particularly to reach a goal, an adjuvant is a substance that helps and enhances the pharmacological effect of a drug, or increases the ability of an antigen to stimulate the immune system. Concern has been heightened because pregnant women, who are first in line for the vaccine, have been told that they should preferentially choose the vaccine without adjuvant, as we have less experience with this version.</p>
<p>But none of the adjuvant ingredients have known risks. Pregnant women in Dr. Rossi's family practice are told, especially in the third trimester, to go ahead and get whichever vaccine is available. This is a clear example of the risk of the vaccine being negligible compared to the risk of the illness. Dr. Hailey's pediatric practice has been similarly inundated with telephone calls. Their receptionist tells every caller, "All the doctors in the practice are recommending that everyone get the vaccine."</p>
<p>The fact is that seasonal flu can cause serious complications even in otherwise healthy people -- but just not as often. The yearly influenza vaccine is recommended for people over 65 and for people with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, emphysema, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. It is also recommended for children under two and their caregivers. We both regularly recommend the seasonal influenza vaccine to all healthy patients if they are interested -- because the risk of the vaccine is very low. Seasonal flu is unlikely to be a major problem locally until about January, but it is safe to get both vaccines at the same time. There is no significant interaction between the two, contrary to earlier reports.</p>
<p>What can you do if you don't qualify as a high-risk patient, and have to wait a week or more for the vaccine?</p>
<p>- First, people who are ill should stay at home! Classic symptoms include fever, cough, aching muscles, headache, sore throat, and nausea, although not everyone gets every symptom, especially children. If you or your children are in a high-risk group (again: pregnancy, a chronic health problem, children under two) and you see someone who is clearly unwell -- leave the area as soon as you can.</p>
<p>- Second, wash your hands -- a lot.</p>
<p>- Third, cough or sneeze into your shoulder. If you cough into your hands, and then touch a doorknob, you've left your virus there for the next person.</p>
<p>- Fourth, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth -- especially when you are at work or at school.</p>
<p>- Finally, if you think you might have the flu, you have several options. You can visit www.HealthLinkBC.ca[http://www.HealthLinkBC.ca] for more information. You can call 811. Or you can call your doctor, especially if you are high risk.</p>
<p>Most of the time your doctor can diagnose the flu over the phone, and assess whether or not your symptoms are more alarming than usual -- i.e., whether you or your child need to be seen by a physician. Many doctors have a low threshold for prescribing Tamiflu, including over the telephone. Tamiflu is an antiviral that is safe for everyone, including pregnant women. Taken for five days, it can reduce the length and severity of the illness.</p>
<p>Our counselling visits in the office don't take too long ... all we say is get the shot when you can! The seasonal flu shot changes every year, and few people seem to worry that it hasn't been "tested enough." The same testing and research procedures have been followed in developing the H1N1 vaccine. If they hadn't, the vaccine would have been available a lot sooner.</p>
<p>The main side effect seems to be a sore arm for a couple of days after the shot, so get it in your non-dominant arm, i.e. if you are right-handed, get the vaccine in your left arm. There has been some talk of the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome after receiving the H1N1 vaccine, as there has been after other vaccines were introduced. This is very rare. It's important to put the vaccine risk in perspective. The risk of serious illness from H1N1 is much higher.</p>
<p>Have we each been vaccinated? You bet -- and we've advised all our family members to receive the vaccine when it's more widely available. We've even promised our non-physician husbands a Snoopy band-aid when they return.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Olympics propel legislation to end paramedics strike</b>
</div><div>Richard J. Dalton Jr., With files from Jonathan Fowlie   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>324 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon acknowledged on Tuesday that the Olympics are a factor behind legislation that would end the ambulance strike.</p>
<p>Falcon, who introduced legislation on Monday to force back to work the 3,600 paramedics and dispatchers, had said the demands of the H1N1 pandemic required an end to the strike.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the union representing ambulance workers released excerpts of a document from the Vancouver Organizing Committee that asks the BC Ambulance Service to guarantee that ambulance services would be provided during the Olympics without disruption.</p>
<p>"If we are unable to obtain that guarantee (through either settlement of the strike or legislated 'detente' for the Games), then Vanoc will be required to initiate alternative contingency plans to avoid cancellation of the Games," the document, sent in September, said, according to the Canadian Union of Public Employees.</p>
<p>CUPE president Barry O'Neill said, "Nobody would believe it had nothing to do with the Olympics, in particular after reading a document like that from Vanoc."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Falcon acknowledged the Olympics played a role in the legislation.</p>
<p>"There's no question H1N1 was the primary motivator here," he said. "The Olympics is a secondary but important issue, there's no question about it."</p>
<p>Separately, Labour Minister Murray Coell said Tuesday he would create a commission to develop a new bargaining structure for paramedics and dispatchers, who have been on strike since April 1.</p>
<p>The commission is expected to develop proposals by Dec. 15 to repair the labour relations structure.</p>
<p>If the legislation to end the strike passes, paramedics and dispatchers would get a three-per-cent raise under a contract set to expire March 31.</p>
<p>The creation of the commission was expected as Falcon had said he would ask Coell to appoint a commissioner to review the labour structure.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>B.C. drugstores see spike in Tamiflu prescriptions; Over 70,000 filled in past month, as patients at risk of flu encouraged to take precautions</b>
</div><div>Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>396 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The number of prescriptions of Tamiflu dispensed by B.C. drugstores for H1N1 swine flu treatment shot up in the past week, to 28,000 from 18,000 a week in the two previous weeks.</p>
<p>Altogether, 70,000 prescriptions have been filled in the past month alone, Dr. Bonnie Henry of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said on a live, noon-hour Vancouver Sun web chat Tuesday.</p>
<p>"That is considerably more than has been used in any other year although we do not track it specifically in most years," she added later.</p>
<p>Henry, director of public health emergency management at the BCCDC, said Tamiflu works by blocking viral replication.</p>
<p>People who don't have underlying conditions that may put them at higher risk of complications and severe disease from H1N1 should talk to their doctors about getting a Tamiflu prescription that could be filled if they get sick before they get vaccinated in late November or in December, she said.</p>
<p>"For some people, this will mean getting a prescription that they can fill if they get sick with influenza-like illness or having a plan to talk to their doctor's office if they get sick so they can tell whether they should take the medication or not.</p>
<p>"But it is very important not to take Tamiflu if you are not ill and [people] should not fill their prescription beforehand," she said, noting the virus could become resistant to the drug if it is overused.</p>
<p>Prescriptions are paid for by the government if they are dispensed to people with actual symptoms. Otherwise, consumers can expect to pay about $50 out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, provincial medical health officer, said Tuesday even high-risk people who have already received a flu shot should speak to their physician about having a prescription for Tamiflu on hand.</p>
<p>"It would be good to have that prescription handy, because it can take 10 to 14 days for the vaccine to provide a protective effect. In that interim period, you may need access to anti-viral drugs."</p>
<p>The province has purchased enough Tamiflu to treat one million people.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 virus linked to three more deaths in B.C.; Provincial medical health officer predicts additional deaths and hospitalizations as pandemic peak nears</b>
</div><div>Randy Shore   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>590 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Three more people have died in British Columbia from illness associated with the swine flu, according to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Two of the deaths were in the Fraser Health Region and one was in the Vancouver Coastal Health Region. One case was a sudden death that will require an autopsy, while the other two involved people with underlying health problems.</p>
<p>"As expected we have seen a jump in cases, severe cases and unfortunately in deaths," provincial medical health officer Dr. Perry Kendall told a press conference Tuesday.</p>
<p>The CDC's weekly report on the pandemic H1N1 outbreak gripping B.C. also shows a startling increase in the number of hospitalizations attributed to the virus in the seven days ending Nov. 2. Hospitalizations totalled 199 for the entire period from the pandemic's outbreak in April to Oct. 26. But another 162 people were admitted to hospital last week alone.</p>
<p>Sixteen people, including a child from Yukon, have died in B.C. since the outbreak began in April. Thirteen of the 15 British Columbians who died had underlying health problems, Kendall said. "We are reassured to note that the character of the illness is not changing," Kendall said. "It's predominantly mild to moderate and self-limiting."</p>
<p>Kendall said the sharp rise in hospitalizations was expected as the second wave of the illness struck. He cautioned that even more hospitalizations and deaths are likely as the peak of the pandemic approaches. "The health care system will show some strain and we are already seeing that in emergency rooms where people are showing up in large numbers," Kendall said.</p>
<p>Hospitals are acquiring extra equipment and shutting down non-essential services to handle the rising number of flu cases requiring hospitalization and intensive care. The province has ordered 25 additional ventilators to bring the total in B.C. to 992 units. "The federal government has a stockpile of 500 fairly sophisticated ventilators which are kept in Ottawa," Kendall said. "We can access those relatively quickly should we need to, in less than 24 hours."</p>
<p>As the number of people being hospitalized with swine flu has increased, hospitals are shutting down some ambulatory clinics, reducing day surgeries and postponing elective procedures. Children's Hospital has already set up a flu assessment centre separate from the emergency room for children with flu-like symptoms. Hospitals are also being hobbled by increased staff absenteeism due to illness, Kendall said. About 25 per cent of the staff at BC Women's Hospital took time off due to illness last week.</p>
<p>All areas of the province are reporting H1N1 infection, with high absenteeism in schools in the north. Five schools in Kitimat have been closed for the balance of the week, Kendall said.</p>
<p>By this time next week, clinics will have distributed 800,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine through 200 clinics, mainly to people deemed to be in the highest risk groups. They include people under the age of 65 with chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes or compromised immune systems, pregnant women past their 20th week, and those living in remote or first nations communities.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rare infection almost fatal for education minister; Margaret MacDiarmid now at home, expecting full recovery</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Fowlie   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>812 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Education Minister Margaret MacDiarmid was rushed to hospital late last month after the immediate onset of a searing headache.</p>
<p>Within just a few hours, the 52-year-old was completely unresponsive, and doctors were pumping antibiotics into her bloodstream and telling her family she had about a one-in-five chance of dying.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid has pneumococcal meningitis, a rare but serious infection that affects about one or two out of every 100,000 people each year in Canada.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, MacDiarmid said she's improved dramatically in the 11 days since the incident and is now recovering at home. She added that experts anticipate a full recovery, but say it can take a month for people to get back to full strength.</p>
<p>"It happens catastrophically quickly," MacDiarmid said Tuesday of pneumococcal meningitis in an interview with The Vancouver Sun, her first since the ordeal.</p>
<p>"It's really a life-and-death emergency."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said the headache arrived on the evening of Oct. 23, while she was having dinner with her youngest brother's family.</p>
<p>"I got up to play a game with my niece," recalled MacDiarmid, who was a family doctor for 23 years before getting into politics. "And suddenly I felt like the top of my head was going to blow off."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said she knew something was wrong, but was reluctant to go to the hospital, especially because of the pressures being put on the system by the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>But her brother, Andy MacDiarmid, an internist from Winnipeg, knew better.</p>
<p>"It was my brother who looked at me -- he'd been with me all day -- and he actually said within about five or 10 minutes, 'I think you have meningitis and we need to call 911,'" she said.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said within about half an hour she was on the floor, couldn't move, and was crying because of the pain.</p>
<p>"I had my eyes closed and I bowed to my brother's judgment," she said, adding that by the time an ambulance took her to the hospital she was completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said she considers herself extremely lucky she was with her brother and his wife when the headache came on.</p>
<p>"Had I been home -- my husband was out of town -- I probably would have gone to bed and, honestly, I probably would have died," she said.</p>
<p>"The mortality rate with this kind of meningitis is 20 per cent, even with treatment," she added.</p>
<p>"I obviously wouldn't have had treatment because I would have just gone to sleep."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said she can't remember anything from after Friday night when she was being taken to hospital, until almost two days later.</p>
<p>"I didn't know my family. I was unresponsive. My husband said he looked into my face and there was no one there," she said, adding that even when her memory returned, things were hazy.</p>
<p>"I recognized my husband, but even then I only saw his head. I couldn't see his body," she said, recalling the Sunday morning when her memory begins again.</p>
<p>"My brain got very swollen because of the infection," she added, saying she still has trouble remembering things like phone numbers.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said she was initially taken to Surrey's Peace Arch Hospital, but was transferred to Royal Columbian two days later because doctors thought she would need to be placed on a machine to help her breathe.</p>
<p>But the ventilator was not necessary, and MacDiarmid said she is now feeling better each day.</p>
<p>She said she got out of hospital last Thursday, but needs to remain on intravenous antibiotics until they have been in her system for a full 14 days.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said doctors are optimistic she will recover fully, but said they've told her it can take up to a month before people are truly better.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said she doesn't know when she will be back at work, but said other ministers have been covering her duties, and that she will return as soon as she's ready.</p>
<p>"Things will be just fine for the amount of time I'll be off and I do believe that when I come back I'll be 100 per cent and good to go," she said.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid added that she wanted to speak publicly about her ordeal now because she thought it important that people know the story, and because she wanted to thank all the health-care workers involved in her care.</p>
<p>"If you have to have a catastrophic illness, it's really good to know that the system is responsive and it's going to work for you," said MacDiarmid. "I was just absolutely inspired by everybody [who helped]. They really, really saved my life."</p>

</p>
<p>The city is counting on the province to pick up the tab for all the money it's spending on Ottawa's swine-flu vaccination program.</p>
<p>Councillor Diane Deans said municipal public health officials have been told that all reasonable expenses for the program will be covered, and she expects the costs could be in the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>"They tax for health care. They should be paying for health care," said Deans, chairwoman of the community and protective services committee.</p>
<p>The province has set aside $650 million to cover its H1N1 pandemic response. However, Health Minister Deb Matthews could not say Tuesday how much the province is spending on the effort.</p>
<p>She said the city, through its public health board, will pay for the distribution of vaccines while the province pays for the vaccine and the OHIP costs for physicians who administer it. "We've made it very clear to the public health units that if they need more resources to get the vaccine distributed we want to be able to help them," Matthews said.</p>

</p>
<p>Ontario's health minister says she doesn't know how many people in the province have been vaccinated to date, prompting renewed criticism of the province's H1N1 pandemic response.</p>
<p>Deb Matthews, named health minister in October, says she is waiting for better information before announcing the number of those vaccinated.</p>
<p>"We don't have good data yet," Matthews said in an interview. "We don't want to release numbers that aren't accurate."</p>
<p>She nevertheless listed off vaccination numbers for some of the province's 36 public boards of health during question period at Queen's Park. They included Ottawa's, which has administered 80,000 vaccinations, and Toronto, where 100,000 people have been inoculated. (Ottawa's medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, expects vaccinations in the city to break the 100,000 mark sometime today.)</p>
<p>In total, Matthews announced she could account for 322,300 flu shots across the province.</p>
<p>The tally is becoming more complicated as more vaccine is going into the hands of doctors, according to Matthews, who says she doesn't want to overwhelm practitioners with paperwork.</p>
<p>Despite the complications, she repeatedly expressed confidence in the province's progress.</p>
<p>"We are on track to deliver our target, which is 2.2 million doses to the people of Ontario, by the end of Saturday," she told the legislature.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians at Queen's Park cast doubts on the pronouncement.</p>
<p>"They're grasping at straws to try to convince the public they have this thing under control when all we've seen for the last week and a half shows exactly the opposite," said NDP leader Andrea Horwath. "The bottom line is it's very, very clear they have no idea how many people have been vaccinated."</p>
<p>Ontario's vaccine rollout has been characterized by regional inconsistency in messaging and execution.</p>
<p>Toronto health officials were perhaps the least prepared to deal with a surge in demand that erupted last Monday after the death of two children. Several clinics were overwhelmed with long lineups and were forced to close barely after opening.</p>
<p>Other parts of the province, such as Sault Ste Marie, Niagara and Algoma, were praised for their ability to handle much higher than expected demand. All three used a form of telephone or computer reservation form to assign appointments.</p>
<p>The latest complication is caused by a slowdown in production at the Quebec plant where the vaccine is made. It forced provincial officials to admit Monday the province may shortly see a total, if temporary, suspension of vaccinations.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, public health officials say they could run out of the vaccine in two to three days unless more is delivered. Ironically, that may be a sign officials are doing a good job getting the vaccine out.</p>
<p>Each health board is assigned vaccinations on a per capita basis.</p>

<p>The University of Ottawa Gee-Gees women's volleyball team will have two of its games postponed because of swine flu, in accordance with Ontario University Athletics H1N1 policy. A Tuesday release from Ontario University Athletics said a number of players on the Lakehead Thunderwolves team "have flu-like symptoms, including confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus." The Thunderwolves had been scheduled to visit the Gee-Gees for games on Nov. 6 and Nov. 7, which will now be rescheduled -- the release did not say when.</p>

<p>Despite a rising nationwide toll of sickness caused by the H1N1 flu virus and a government push to have people vaccinated for it, almost half of Americans say they aren't likely to get the vaccine, according to a new McClatchy-Ipsos poll. Just 52 per cent say they're likely to get the vaccine: 33 per cent who say they're very likely to get it and 19 per cent who say they're somewhat likely. Forty-seven per cent say they aren't likely to get it: 30 per cent who say they aren't at all likely to get it and 17 per cent who say they aren't very likely.</p>

<p>With the continued outbreak of the H1N1 Influenza Flu Virus this flu season will be unlike any other for employers. It's a good idea for employers to create a risk management team responsible for maintaining awareness, alerting others in the company, and implementing stages of a plan to deal with the outbreak. Employers should ensure employees understand the symptoms of H1N1 and when they should not attend work. Where necessary, attendance or leave of absence polices should be amended to allow employees to care for sick family members and dependents. And while it may seem obvious, employees should be reminded of basic preventative measures such as proper hand washing. Hand sanitizer should be made available in public areas, as should antimicrobial wipes for cleaning work surfaces. Small steps to promote a healthy workforce can lead to a healthy bottom line.

<div id="hd"><b>Votes don't spring from misery</b>
</div><div>John Ivison    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>1049 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>If you were watching the early edition of CBC's The National on Monday evening and found yourself nodding in agreement with a clean-cut young family man who was criticizing the government's response to the H1N1 crisis, a word of caution -- Mark Sakamoto has some skin in this game.</p>
<p>A strategist in Michael Ignatieff's office, Mr. Sakamoto was in line at a Toronto H1N1 clinic with his wife when he was asked for his opinion on the government's response. "It seems to me there's been a lot of lag time. We knew about this coming down the pipe for a long time, so I wonder why it is as disorganized as it is," he said, without identifying his affiliation to the CBC crew.</p>
<p>It's a small tale but it is representative of the opportunism that has typified the Liberal response to the H1N1 outbreak. From Bob Rae claiming that the life of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio may have been saved if the government had made vaccine available sooner, to Liberal president Alf Apps' e-mail to party members saying this could be Stephen Harper's Hurricane Katrina, there has been a less than tasteful tendency to attempt to score cheap political points.</p>
<p>In the emergency debate in the House of Commons on Monday night, health critic Carolyn Bennett said there is a fine line between the Official Opposition performing due diligence in holding the government to account and partisan grandstanding. She should know, having crossed that line by distributing a flyer that showed a distressed aboriginal girl with a thermometer in her mouth, under the heading "No vaccine, only body bags."</p>
<p>Mr. Apps went so far as to mull that the Conservatives are philosophically disposed to let Canadians fend for themselves and that we may all be victims of "some clinical cost-benefit analysis, premised on the theory that expense could be avoided if demand for the vaccine were suppressed and access to immunization for most was made well nigh impossible."</p>
<p>But those Liberals who think votes may spring from misery would do well to watch NDP leader Jack Layton, whose tone has been much more measured. Yesterday in Question Period, he suggested Ottawa should commit to picking up the tab for 90% of costs incurred fighting H1N1, as it would in the event of natural disasters. Mr. Layton learned the hard way that trying to profit from the misfortune of others doesn't work -- during the 2004 election, he was roasted for blaming then-prime minister Paul Martin for the deaths of homeless people because of lack of funding for affordable housing.</p>
<p>To be fair, Mr. Ignatieff has avoided the worst rhetorical excesses of some of his colleagues. In the emergency debate on Monday, he asked the</p>
<p>government why Canada was behind 35 other countries in ordering vaccine and did not roll out vaccinations until late October, behind other countries like China, the United States and the United Kingdom. He asked legitimate questions about why the Health Minister, Leona Aglukkaq, had previously said that vaccine would be available to all Canadians by early November but had now pushed that back to Christmas. "There is a failure to inform, a failure to prepare, a failure to lead," he said.</p>
<p>But what did the Liberal leader, or anyone else for that matter, really expect? If the government was in charge of the weather, Canada would run out of cold fronts. And here we have three layers of government trying to vaccinate 34 million people. The wonder is that anyone at all has had their jab.</p>
<p>Hard as it may be when you've been standing in the rain outside a vaccination clinic for six hours only to be told to come back tomorrow -- or when your child's temperature soars to 105F -- perhaps we should all put this in some kind of perspective. This is not a health emergency -- at least, not yet.</p>
<p>We are in Day 10 of a 12-week vaccination campaign -- the biggest in Canadian history. The government says vaccine was not ordered until August because the chief medical officer and his provincial colleagues agreed that Canada's seasonal flu vaccine should be completed first. It should be remembered that seasonal flu kills 4,000 people a year, mainly seniors, while H1N1 has killed a relatively small number -- 101 by the government's most recent count.</p>
<p>There has been a temporary slowdown in production of the vaccine at <span class="companylink">Glaxo SmithKline</span>'s Quebec facility because a batch of unadjuvanted version of the drug was produced for pregnant women (the government can scarcely be blamed for the World Health Organization changing its mind and now recommending that everyone can take the regular adjuvanted version). Unfortunately for all levels of government, the production shortfall coincided with a week of unprecedented demand because of the tragic, high-profile deaths of two young people in Ontario.</p>
<p>Of course mistakes are being made -- Alberta Health Services admitted as much when asked how the entire Calgary Flames roster was vaccinated last Friday while the public waited in long lines, only to see the vaccination program suspended the next day. And nothing should infuriate people more than public health agency decisions to give doses to private, for-profit clinics in Vancouver and Toronto.</p>
<p>But the long lineups and vaccine shortages are likely to be temporary. GSK has already shifted production back to adjuvanted vaccine and is contracted to supply over 50 million doses. Usually one-third of Canadians get a flu shot. Even if that number doubles for H1N1, Canada will still have twice as many doses as needed. One suspects that by the end of this month, there will few lineups and no vaccine shortages.</p>
<p>Still, for now, the unexpected surge in demand, combined with typical government befuddlement, and a temporary production shortfall have formed the cliched perfect storm for the government.</p>
<p>The Liberals have tried to make the most of the squally conditions but having sown the wind, they may yet reap the whirlwind if voters judge they have been more concerned about their own welfare than with that of the people who elect them.</p>

<p>Re: Swine Flu And The New 'Weirdists,' Colby Cosh, Nov. 3.</p>
<p>When Colby Cosh compares medicine's "rationalists and believers" who tell us the "swine-flu vaccine was an unconditionally and undeniably good thing" to the "nutcases and conspiracists who resist it," he misses perhaps the largest portion of the population not at either of these distribution curve extremes. This group no longer confidently knows who to believe.</p>
<p>Canadians spend a lot of money for honest and factual medical advice. Instead they receive pompous and frankly unbelievable messages from those in positions of trust on how we should live our lives. Is it any wonder that today so many are so malleable?</p>

<p>Canadians were justifiably shocked, and parents alarmed, by the recent H1N1 flu deaths of two healthy children. The tragic and sad news of the death of Evan Frustaglio, 13, and an Ontario girl, whose name was not disclosed, rightly made front-page headlines in virtually every Canadian newspaper.</p>
<p>But there has been scant reporting -- indeed, nary a mention here or in the U.S. --about the one specific group of children who have suffered the most fatalities from the scourge of H1N1: disabled children, and in particular, children with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, Down syndrome or asthma.</p>
<p>In the Sept. 4 issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in Atlanta, Georgia, a study entitled Surveillance for Pediatric Deaths Associated with 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection -- United States, April-August 2009 provides data on child deaths related to 2009 H1N1 virus infection. It shows that 36 children younger than 18 years of age perished of H1N1 influenza between April and August 8th and that 67% of these children had at least one highrisk medical condition.</p>
<p>Notably, among children with highrisk medical conditions, more than 90% had neurodevelopmental conditions, such as developmental delay and cerebral palsy. Fifty-nine percent of the children with neurodevelopmental conditions had more than one neurodevelopmental condition and 41% also had a pulmonary problem.</p>
<p>In addition, a study of influenza-associated child deaths during the 2003-04 influenza season also found that a considerable proportion of children had a neurodevelopmental condition.</p>
<p>Recently, the CBC News website reported that in the U.S., about half of hospitalized patients and one-quarter of the people dying of H1N1-related causes are under the age of 25. Many are teenagers, and about 70% of them have some underlying medical condition such as asthma, muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>Yet Quebec's Influenza (H1N1) Self-Care Guide, supposedly mailed to every household in the province, doesn't even</p>
<p>bother to list on its "people at risk" page children with neurological disorders, neuromuscular disorders, intellectual disability or developmental delay -- children that the CDC, in fact, considers at high risk of contracting either seasonal or H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>As a 53-year-old Montrealer who was born with cerebral palsy, I regard the exclusion of disabled children from mention in the Quebec guide as a serious omission, and urge Quebec parents (and indeed all parents) to make themselves aware of the more comprehensive information provided by CDC, which can be found at the following websites:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/highrisk.htm[http://www.cdc.gov.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/h1n1flu/highrisk.htm]-</p>
<p>www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/groups.htmAs[http://www.cdc.gov.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/h1n1flu/groups.htmAs] I write this, the Minnesota Department of Health is confirming the death of Oliver Finley, 11, of Hastings, Minn., who had cerebral palsy. Nancy Finley told the St. Paul Pioneer Press her son died Oct. 17 after an H1N1 flu infection led to a fatal case of pneumonia. Unlike the death of healthy Ontario teen Evan Frustaglio, which captured front-page headlines in newspapers across Canada, the death of Oliver Finley merits less than five lines of press in Minnesota newspapers.</p>
<p>Why the disregard? Well, Oliver had an underlying medical condition, a "mantra" that we've heard repeated so often in news reports of H1N1 deaths. It's almost expected, so let's sweep his death under the rug and not panic. In fact, the term underlying medical condition is deliberately used to reassure the public that it wasn't one of their healthy children.</p>
<p>So the next time -- God forbid! -- a healthy child dies tragically of H1N1 flu, please keep in mind that my 'peeps' and Jerry's Kids are dying too. - Samuel Miller, 53, is a Montrealer who was born with cerebral palsy.

<p>The White House denied Tuesday that any H1N1 flu vaccine is going to terrorism suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, heading off controversy over swine flu prevention priorities. "There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there's no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at his daily briefing. After Gibbs' comment, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said detainees at Guantanamo would receive the vaccine only after active-duty troops, deployed U.S. contractors and civilians and civilians working for the Department of Defense.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization said Tuesday it was valid to assume that most of the cases of influenza reportedly sweeping through Ukraine were caused by H1N1. Ukrainian authorities Sunday launched an urgent appeal for help from world powers after it imposed drastic measures to tackle a surge of flu-like illness in the country. More than 250,000 cases have been reported, according to official figures cited by the WHO. The UN health agency's statement commends Ukraine for "its transparent reporting and open sharing of samples."</p>

<p>Wendy Zajac stared at the cordoned-off area outside Tom Brown Arena on Tuesday morning. Something was missing: the usual lineup for the H1N1 flu vaccination clinic.</p>
<p>She needed a shot for two-year-old Liam.</p>
<p>She walked right up, waited for the couple ahead of her, and got Liam's wristband. Bring the boy at 5 p.m. for the shot, they told her.</p>
<p>"Easy," she shrugged.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>This was at 10:15 a.m., more than an hour after staff began taking reservations for the day, and the Tom Brown clinic still had no shots booked</p>
<p>for the late afternoon and evening. The twin heated tents for early-morning waiting stood empty.</p>
<p>At the Kanata clinic, 45 minutes later, Anna Gallea drove up and was turned away. The day's schedule was full.</p>
<p>But Gallea simply had a case of bad timing; if she had arrived half an hour earlier, she would have snagged a spot.</p>
<p>Is the surge over? It's beginning to look that way.</p>
<p>By the end of Monday, Ottawa had given out about 80,000 vaccine doses -- about the same number of vaccinations it gives for ordinary flu in a typical year's entire flu season. Dr. Isra Levy, the city's medical officer of health, is confident that number will reach 100,000 sometime today.</p>
<p>Other major clinics this week, such as in Orléans, have generally been able to serve everyone who lines up early, with enough wristbands left over to handle those arriving in the next hour or so.</p>
<p>Staff start handing out wristbands at 9 a.m. on weekdays, and the shots begin at 2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The one exception is the Centrepointe clinic -- wristbands at 1 p.m., shots from 5 to 9 p.m. The lineup there, mostly of people who need to go after their day jobs, starts a couple of hours before wristbands are available.</p>
<p>Centrepointe was, as usual, extremely busy Tuesday. The line stretched along Constellation Crescent and onto Centrepointe Drive, and at 1 p.m. there was a further influx of people arriving in cars.</p>
<p>But at Tom Brown, a surge never really developed.</p>
<p>Public Health staff had wristbands to offer until about 2 p.m. The only inconvenience was that hockey players couldn't get into the parking lot and had to park on the streets.</p>
<p>Tuesday was the first day for a "roving" clinic in Kinburn, and that went smoothly, too. At 3:15 p.m., Public Health announced on its Twitter feed: "West Carleton Community Complex (5670 Carp Rd., Kinburn) is now 60 minutes ahead of schedule. The clinic is releasing 100 more wristbands."</p>
<p>The department is taking it easy at some of the roving clinics -- smaller clinics that are set up one or two days at a time, mostly in rural locations. Today there are two:</p>
<p>a one-day event at the Stittsville Community Centre, and the first of two consecutive days at Jim Durrell Arena on Walkley Road in Ottawa.</p>
<p>At these smaller clinics, including Sarsfield on Monday, the practice has been to be conservative in handing out wristbands in the morning, so that Public Health officials can see how fast nurses are able to process the crowds.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No time to play politics - or jump queues</b>
</div><div>The Gazette</div>

</p>
<p>A crisis brings out the best in people, and the worst in people. So far the H1N1 swine flu seems to be bringing out mainly the less admirable side of some Canadians, starting with queue-jumpers and including those politicians who are stretching common sense badly out of shape in an effort to profit from public concern.</p>
<p>In Ottawa on Monday, opposition parties did what they could to depict Leona Aglukkaq, the federal health minister, as a moron or a menace, or both. We're having trouble seeing the advantage to anyone in that. To the extent that this is a genuine crisis, surely a more constructive tone would be more helpful.</p>
<p>Some in the media are just as bad. Yesterday we heard a respected Montreal radio broadcaster shrilly demand of Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc if he would resign as soon as a single Quebec child dies of swine flu.</p>
<p>What madness is this? In an ordinary year, ordinary flu and pneumonia kill about 13 Canadians per 100,000. Every death is a tragedy, but nobody demands any resignations. When did life in the modern nanny state cause some people to expect government to solve all problems perfectly and instantly?</p>
<p>The federal Liberals, with hawk-like hindsight, say Canada should have ordered vaccine sooner, as some other countries did. But the government notes that Canada has so far received more doses per capita than any other country. It's hard to get angry about that.</p>
<p>It is certainly easier to get upset about retail delivery of the vaccine, which is the responsibility of the provinces and regional health units. Most jurisdictions decided to inoculate people at a limited number of centres, and according to a priority system, with the most vulnerable demographic groups getting priority. Almost everywhere, however, this last part was not enforced. There's plenty of evidence of queue-jumping in many places: not all those healthy adults in those long lineups across Canada can be asthmatic.</p>
<p>A couple of teen deaths last week - statistically improbable, but dramatically alarming anyway - galvanized public opinion about the flu shot, giving an unforeseen shot in the arm to demand for the vaccine. Where early-October polls showed that only 40-some per cent of Canadians wanted the shot, the latest survey responses are closing in on double that number. Call it the pet-rock effect: There's nothing like a reported shortage to stimulate demand.</p>
<p>Just as there are no atheists in foxholes, there are few vaccine skeptics in epidemics, even incipient ones. Conspiracy theorists who toyed a month ago with the idea that the vaccine was a plot now think the government is plotting to keep it away from us. Get a grip!</p>
<p>Queue-jumping always poses a stark question of fairness. We would like to trust everyone to do the right thing, but apparently we cannot. Those who wait until they're called are penalized, while those who cheat the system prosper. This is fairly trivial at the bus stop, but more serious when it deprives vulnerable individuals of vaccination they need.</p>
<p>This tests each person's social solidarity, and not all Canadians are passing. Quebec health authorities said yesterday they will bring in a coupon and/or bracelet system to make sure only those actually in the currently-scheduled high-risk group get their shots; others will be turned away.</p>
<p>That will be an improvement, although this kind of improvisation does make Quebecers wonder why all this wasn't better thought out well in advance. Still, it is encouraging that officials are trying to improve the process.</p>
<p>While they're at it, authorities should broaden the roll-out of the vaccine, as soon as enough is available, to schools and workplaces. Making children and seniors wait in four- and five-hour lineups reveals that bureaucrats across Canada are tone-deaf to the public interest.</p>
<p>The decision to have so few administration points seems to have been intended to control vaccine supply tightly, to direct it to the neediest. That seemed reasonable when demand for the shots was low. But the failure to police the lineups has badly undermined that strategy.</p>
<p>Still, political leaders are not villains, health authorities are not fools, this challenge is in some ways unprecedented, and this is after all influenza, not Ebola or bubonic plague. Keep calm and follow the rules.</p>

<p>As I read the stories about the H1N1 vaccination debacle, I am getting angrier and angrier at healthy people who are refusing to wait their turn and at parents who are using their children's asthma to get to the front of the line.</p>
<p>In the middle of my front hall, I have an oxygen tank. It is for my 39-year-old husband who lives and struggles with cystic fibrosis. He spends an average of two months a year in hospital and next year he will finally be listed for a lung transplant. Yet he has to line up on Friday morning with all the others.</p>
<p>Why is there not a true priority system, so that people on oxygen and their families can be triaged and handled quickly? Not only does my husband need his vaccine, but so do I and my 4- and 6-year-old , since if any one of us gets sick, there is a very real chance we will make him sick as well.</p>
<p>Give the clinics a few days to handle truly sick people, then line up with your kids. I want everyone to get vaccinated, but it's time to establish a system of true priorities.</p>

<p>I got the kids vaccinated for H1N1 on the weekend and thanks to the wristband policy it went very smoothly.</p>
<p>I lazily headed over at 7 a.m. and was about the 100th person there. After around an hour of standing in the sunshine reading a book I had my wristbands and was assigned a 10:30 slot. We arrived at that time to a rather festive atmosphere. Children played on the nearby field or coloured or read quietly. We chatted with neighbours.</p>
<p>We were eventually called into the arena and watched a rec hockey game for another half-hour or so before entering the clinic and quickly receiving the shot. We were on our way home by 12:30. The pleasant weather certainly helped make the whole thing pretty painless.</p>
<p>Aside from doing our civic duty to help contain the spread of the virus and a mild concern about the possibility of serious complications should the kids get the flu, the whole process was far preferable to being up all night with sick children.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are lots of ways the delivery of H1N1 vaccine could have been improved, and the first few days were a mess, but the city seems to be getting the hang of it.</p>
<p>As an aside, there are now stories that people have been advertising to wait in line for others, at a rate of $15 per hour. To combat this, people are being required to wear their own or their families' wristbands until they get inside the clinic. That's fine. But is this really a problem? Seems entrepreneurial to me. Why shouldn't someone be allowed to pay to avoid waiting in line, particularly if pregnant or ill, or caring for small children?</p>
<p>Is there some moral requirement to do your own waiting? As long as the person who arrives at the door with the wristband is entitled to be there, who cares how he or she got there?</p>

<p>Shame on each and every individual who received the H1N1 vaccine knowing they were, in no way, in the priority groups.</p>
<p>All of you who did this, no exceptions, have placed the lives of those most vulnerable at risk.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that you say a prayer, and if you don't believe in God, then at least hope that not one Ottawa resident who should get a priority vaccination yet couldn't due to long line-ups or vaccine shortages, gets sick and succumbs to this virus.</p>
<p>And all because you made yourself a priority.</p>

<p>Kudos to the City of Ottawa employees who organized the H1N1 flu clinic at the Vanier Richelieu Community Centre on Saturday. My wife and I were very impressed at how they processed hundreds of people so efficiently and relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Daniel, who normally works at the St-Laurent Community Centre and was in charge of shepherding us through the process at the Vanier location. His friendly and thoughtful manner did wonders to defuse an already stressful situation.</p>
<p>Before handing out numbered bracelets, he chided the first 200 bleary-eyed souls who had lined up in the cold and wet darkness at 5:30 a.m. with a cheerful remark: "First of all, I think you're all crazy!"</p>
<p>The people in line went on to spontaneously applaud Daniel and his colleagues for their efficiency and good humour.</p>
<p>Despite the inconvenience of lining up so early for such a serious purpose, our family's experience was positive and reminded us that city staffers are more than capable of delivering outstanding service and value to taxpayers when called upon.</p>

<p>My husband and I are trying to be good citizens and wait patiently until it is our turn to receive our H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>We are both in our 50s and in good health. I will continue to follow the guidelines set out by the public health authorities to get the vaccine so we can prevent getting the flu.</p>
<p>But my worry is that when it is our turn there will be no more vaccine, then what? By following the rules are we placing ourselves in jeopardy?</p>
<p>I also worry and wonder whether our 20-year-old son, who is in residence at college in Toronto, will get his shot.</p>

<p>I received my H1N1 flu shot in Kemptville at the municipal centre on Monday. I was unsure if I would be included in the high-risk group despite having several health problems. After talking it over with several people who encouraged me, I did go. I was amazed at how well the clinic was organized and operated.</p>
<p>All of the public health personnel and volunteers I came in touch with were very professional, helpful and caring. These people are handling a very necessary and stressful job in a magnificent way. Thank you.</p>

<p>What is wrong with some Ottawans? Why do they feel that their health is so much more important than their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>I listen, read and watch the news and I think there is no doubt that many people are getting H1N1 shots when they don't fit into the priority categories.</p>
<p>I like to think the best of people but this behaviour has been anything but. I just hope the people with their shots continue to watch and hopefully feel some shame when they see infants and pregnant women waiting in line and fearing that short-term supply runs out before they get their shots.</p>

<p>Memo to the H1N1 vaccination chaos managers: what about people who travel?</p>
<p>Having tried unsuccessfully on Sunday for my vaccination because I didn't fit into one of the priority groups, I am reminded of the saying that rules and regulations are written for people who don't have any common sense.</p>
<p>How about those of us who must travel internationally in the near future and will come into contact with literally thousands of people from all over the world? I guess that doesn't qualify as being a high enough threat to our health.</p>

<p>Re: Hospital staff bring family to workplace vaccine clinic, Nov. 2.</p>
<p>This Citizen article suggests that the decision to give flu shots to families and The Ottawa Hospital's staff raises a question of ethics. It has nothing to do with ethics, but everything to do with common sense.</p>
<p>Is there anyone who would disagree that, at all costs and as a first priority, we must ensure the continued good health of our first line of defence? These are the people who work in our medical facilities of all kinds. They are the ones who, in one way or another, will take care of the rest of us. They must be the top priority for immunization.</p>
<p>And what of their families? It makes perfect sense to inoculate them at the same time, given the way the H1N1 virus spreads so quickly within families and that we are still unsure just how effective this new vaccine really is.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, my nephew, his wife and one of their two children in Toronto all got the H1N1 virus. It spread from one member of the family to another with blinding speed. None had been inoculated. How could they? The vaccine had not been rolled out at that time. Would it have protected any of them? All of them? We certainly hope so but we simply don't know.</p>
<p>By protecting their immediate family members, we are also protecting the health-care workers themselves. That is what is important and not someone's notion of how many angels should or should not be dancing on the head of a pin.</p>
<p>For humanity's sake, stop quibbling and get on with the job!</p>

<p>After reading and hearing several complaints about the Ottawa vaccination clinics, I felt compelled to write my personal opinion, which in no way reflects the views of my employer or co-workers.</p>
<p>We are all under a lot of pressure -- the people who line up for vaccinations and those of us who keep Ottawa's clinics running, both on-site and off. However, the public may deal with that one day in a line -- we are going to deal with weeks of this. We deserve support, particularly the nurses whom I believe are bearing the brunt of the pressure to vaccinate so many. I am not a nurse; I am in an administrative role.</p>
<p>We all felt badly about the long lines and our first week was brutal. The days were full of adults complaining and children screaming and crying. You may hear their screams and cries for the short time you are in the actual clinic but try eight hours or more of that while you sit on a hard chair or stand directing people. Then add in the reluctant, screaming kids who refuse to get the shot and hold up the line while their parent tries to convince them otherwise.</p>
<p>When we get home and read the newspapers or listen to the news the last thing we want to hear after a day like that are complaints about what an inadequate job, we or our department is doing-- when we are all working extremely hard, absolutely non-stop, with irregular and extended hours for many.</p>
<p>I can only hope we can be calm and patient with each other through this because we are all in this together. This is a new experience for everyone. We greatly appreciate any gratitude shown to us thus far. Thank you for caring about us, too.</p>

<p>We can stop H1N1's progress with a simple measure: Declare a Canada-wide (or affected region-wide) health week in mid-November.</p>
<p>During that week, all schools, colleges, stores, theatres, and other crowded places (except hospitals) should be closed; hockey and other games and gatherings of people cancelled; trains, buses, and the métro stopped, with free parking on streets instead.</p>
<p>In that one week, all sick people would end up in hospitals and the influx of infected people would be effectively stopped, thus, the spread of H1N1 virus would be prevented, at least temporarily. This measure has been successfully used in Mexico. We have to apply it right now.</p>
<p>I understand there is money involved. Small businesses would be helped if non-working employees were paid under the Employment Insurance plan. The savings to the health-care system and the uninterrupted labour of healthy people thereafter would more than compensate. We have to declare the Health Week right now.</p>

</p>
<p>A few months ago, 700 Haligonians would filter through the glass doors of Dragon Buffet King each day to slurp wonton soup from white porcelain bowls and wolf down plates of chicken wings – the Halifax buffet's most popular item.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks, manager Rui Yang says business has taken a nose dive. Now she's lucky to get 400 to 500 people in on an average weekday – a drop of 30 to 40 per cent. “Right now we're not as busy as before, probably because people are taking greater precautions and eating at home,” she said.</p>
<p>She suspects elevated fears of contracting H1N1 have driven customers away.</p>
<p>As the second wave of swine flu sweeps across the country, the public's fears are trickling down to the restaurant industry. While buffet operators such as Ms. Yang are noting a drop in business, others are fielding far more complaints than usual from germaphobic patrons. Some have loosened their otherwise strict sick leave policies so that sneezing servers don't infect others.</p>
<p>Customers may seem hesitant about taking the deep-fried shrimp from the stainless steel buffet trays at Ms. Yang's restaurant these days, but she says the take-out side of her business hasn't suffered in the same way – orders have remained strong since H1N1 hit.</p>
<p>That's no surprise to the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association. During the SARS outbreak of 2003, it noted that while many Toronto restaurants saw fewer customers coming in, those who offered take-out and delivery services enjoyed an increase in business.</p>
<p>Garth Whyte, president and chief executive officer of the CRFA, said it's still too early to measure the impact of H1N1 on the industry, but those in the restaurant business are bracing themselves. “It's a concern in our industry because we're front-line.”</p>
<p>Frances Liu, manager of Winnipeg's Foody Goody Chinese Buffet, said she hasn't noticed a change in the number of customers in her restaurant, but there is a difference in their behaviour.</p>
<p>In the past, most would turn a blind eye to patrons who skipped the tongs and instead grabbed at the spring rolls with their bare hands. Now, concerned about the spread of swine flu, customers are reporting the less-hygienic to staff.</p>
<p>“It happened a couple of times with kids running to the Jell-O and putting their hands into [it],” said Ms. Liu.</p>
<p>“Another teenager … he used his hands to grab pizza, split it, and put [the rest] back,” she said. “We always thought that it's just common courtesy – you don't touch other people's food.”</p>
<p>With every complaint, Ms. Liu says her staff immediately remove the contaminated serving tray and replace it with a new one. Her staff has also had to stop patrons from taking their dirty plates back into the line when returning for second helpings.</p>
<p>It's the image of cleanliness that's key. “Perception is everything,” said Mr. Whyte. “Their business depends on people having a healthy experience. Any type of sickness that would be linked to their restaurant would be bad. It's non-negotiable.”</p>
<p>In 2006, the CRFA drafted a guide to planning for a flu pandemic. The living document recommends that managers track illness among staff as well as who they may have come into contact with. It also recommends greater lenience for sick leave.</p>
<p>“If I see staff getting sick, I will just tell them to go home,” said Ms. Liu. “Other staff might get sick and we'll get the customers sick.”</p>
<p>She's also placed hand sanitizer at all the staff work stations in the restaurant so employees can disinfect their hands with alcohol gel before they retrieve coffee, tea and ice for customers.</p>
<p>In Halifax, Ms. Yang said she's encouraged staff who aren't battling flu themselves but who have ill family members to stay at home.</p>
<p>Mr. Whyte said restaurant managers should be encouraging employees to get the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Gregg Hebert, a server at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Toronto, said a few of his co-workers have called to cancel shifts in recent weeks due to illness and haven't been pressured by managers.</p>
<p>No one wants their order of chicken parmigiana brought over by a sniffling server, it seems.</p>
<p>“[Managers] are not really pressing them to explain themselves,” he said. “They're obviously not going to push it. I think they're playing safe.”</p>

<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>The Alberta government has launched an investigation into how members of the Calgary Flames and their families scored swine flu shots at a special clinic as thousands of people waited in line for the vaccine or were turned away.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert said he wants to know if the shots were "inappropriately diverted" to the hockey players while other Albertans stood in line for hours.</p>
<p>"There is only one supplier in the province and that's us," he said. "They would only be diverted with the approval of the chief medical officer of health."</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical health officer, said he first learned about the issue through the news media Tuesday and declined to comment due to the investigation.</p>
<p>Ken King, president of the Flames, said the players and their families received their shots Friday at a private location. He said the team contacted Alberta Health Services and requested the clinic based on recommendations from team doctors, the NHL and provincial guidelines in place at the time.</p>
<p>"We thought that we were working within a protocol that Alberta Health Services thought was appropriate," he said.</p>
<p>Players are at a high risk of spreading the virus "due to the fact that they have frequent physical contact, onerous domestic and cross-border travel, extreme exertion and, frankly, are in very close contact with other teams," he said.</p>
<p>Part of the consideration was that players are frequently recognized and could have caused a stir at a mass clinic, he said.</p>
<p>The revelation is one more hit for the Alberta government, which is facing criticism for the way it has managed its vaccination program.</p>
<p>Initially, anyone who came to one of the mass clinics was vaccinated. But that led to huge lineups and the clinics have been closed since the weekend so the plan could be fixed to focus on high-risk patients.</p>
<p>"It's a failure of leadership that we are providing vaccines willy-nilly to whoever has money, to whoever has access, when cancer patients, when chronic lung patients, when pregnant women and their children can't get it," said Alberta Liberal leader David Swann.</p>
<p>"It's a violation of the basic principles of public health care."</p>

<p>On dusty bookshelves in many offices at Queen's Park you will find them, reports on Walkerton, on Ipperwash, on forensic pathology, on wrongful convictions and more.</p>
<p>They are the work of judicial inquiries, ordered in the white-heat of crisis, usually years and millions of dollars in the making, released in a media spotlight, then often consigned to the obscurity of half-measures and good intentions.</p>
<p>The late Archie Campbell understood that it's human nature to divert the gaze to other matters once any emergency has passed. But he hoped that in matters of pandemics and public health, things might unfold otherwise.</p>
<p>Campbell was the judge who led the inquiry into the SARS outbreak in 2003. He died in 2007 at 65, too ill to have attended the release earlier that year of his final report.</p>
<p>But what a clarion call it seems, in hindsight, against just the kind of lost focus and lost momentum that appears to have contributed to last week's H1N1 immunization fiasco.</p>
<p>What happened during SARS, Campbell concluded, was a failure of the system, declines in public health, decay of emergency infrastructure, a starving of resources - all of which occurred through three successive governments of different stripes.</p>
<p>But "SARS taught us lessons that can help us redeem our failures," he said. "SARS may be the last wake-up call we get before the next major outbreak of infection, whether it turns out to be an influenza pandemic or some other health crisis. This is why we cannot forget how bad SARS was."</p>
<p>When Campbell died, then-attorney general Michael Bryant said the judge's report had pulled no punches and that "his thorough work and thoughtful recommendations have made the province a better and safer place."</p>
<p>But Campbell knew better. He knew mere recommendations couldn't do that. He knew only commitment and action could. And he knew that required political will - the most difficult of forces to sustain in a business of infinite demand and finite capacity.</p>
<p>That's why Campbell's first interim report in April 2004 ended with such an emphasis not on matters technical, but on political will.</p>
<p>"The decline of public-health protection in Ontario reflects a consistent lack of political will, over the regime of many successive governments and all three political parties. It will require significant political will on the part of the Minister of Health and the Ontario government to commit the funds and the long-term resolve that are required to bring our public-health protection against infectious disease up to a reasonable standard.</p>
<p>"It would be very easy, now that the SARS outbreak is over, to put public-health reform on the back burner. It is a general habit of governments to respond to a crisis by making a few improvements without fixing the underlying problems responsible for the crisis.</p>
<p>"It would be a tragedy if that turned out to be the case with SARS."</p>
<p>"There is no longer any excuse for governments and hospitals to be caught off guard."</p>
<p>When Premier Dalton McGuinty said Tuesday that in immunizing against H1N1 "there were some places where we didn't do as good a job as should have been done," he acknowledges failure.</p>
<p>When he says "one of the things we need to do when this is all over, is to bring the feds together with the provinces and territories and to ask ourselves questions about how we managed this," he acknowledges a breaking of faith.</p>
<p>With the Archie Campbells, with the Sheela Basrurs, with those who died of SARS. With the lessons they taught that weren't learned.</p>

<p>Some people are getting emails suggesting gargling with salt water or mouthwash, or using saline nasal spray to keep the "portals of entry" clear of the H1N1 virus. At the Big Carrot, a herbalist reaches for the NETI pot, a nasal cleansing pot that sells for $21.99, and suggests filling it with warm water and adding olive leaf, or andrographis and ginger.</p>
<p>But Mount Sinai's Allison McGeer says the only thing that will help prevent H1N1, besides the vaccine, is hand washing.</p>
<p>"Being well hydrated reduces the severity of cough, but gargling? Nothing," McGeer says. "They gargled arsenic in 1918. That didn't work either."</p>

<p>Customers have been asking at the Big Carrot's Wholistic Dispensary on the Danforth for help in preventing H1N1, says its herbalist, who goes by the name Francis Ashwagandha, who suggests a variety of immune-enhancing products.</p>
<p>Nadia Bakir, a naturopathic doctor and professor at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, says the best homeopathic treatment for H1N1 is an individualized one that takes the "chronic state" of the person into account.</p>
<p>When that isn't possible, she recommends homeopathic remedies like Influenzinum, made from three flu viruses.</p>
<p>Influenzinum sells for $6.99 at the Big Carrot and $13.99 at nearby Ottway Herbalist.</p>
<p>Boon says Influenzinum has not been tested with a randomized controlled trial, but that does not necessarily mean it doesn't work for the flu.</p>
<p>Health Canada says it has not licensed any homeopathic medicine for sale, which claims it can fight any flu strain.</p>

<p>What about vitamins, long thought to fight off illnesses?</p>
<p>Mount Sinai's Allison McGeer says "there is no evidence that vitamin C, any doses of vitamin C, protects you from infections like influenza."</p>
<p>She says the hypothesis that high doses of vitamin D might offer some prevention against flu complications is interesting, but it has not yet been proven.</p>

<p>Until swine flu abruptly raised its profile, the Medcan Clinic operated quietly - and profitably - in downtown Toronto offering two-tier medical services to anyone willing to pay.</p>
<p>For more than 20 years, it has depended on a corporate clientele - senior executives whose companies are willing to pay $2,300 a head so that their top managers receive full health assessments (otherwise known as enhanced annual checkups) in swish circumstances without having to endure the hoi polloi.</p>
<p>Technically, these assessments are deemed medically unnecessary, which is why the Ontario Health Insurance Plan doesn't cover them. In fact, these same executives could receive perfectly adequate annual checkups from their family doctors through medicare without paying extra fees.</p>
<p>But humans are snobs. And for many an aspiring corporate leader, membership in something like Medcan is akin to receiving the key to the executive washroom.</p>
<p>More important, should the assessment discover something amiss, the client is in a position to be treated (at medicare expense) from one of the more than 40 physicians affiliated with the clinic.</p>
<p>This mixing of medicare and non-medicare services is perfectly legal according to a provincial health ministry spokesman. And, says Medcan vice-president Bronwen Evans, the fact that a patient must pay a fee upfront before being offered necessary health services has never bothered Queen's Park.</p>
<p>She says that when Premier Dalton McGuinty's government - with much public fanfare - enshrined single-tier medicine into law in 2003, it quietly informed Medcan that its approach was just fine.</p>
<p>"We have worked closely with OHIP to ensure that they're happy with what we're doing," she said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the swine flu epidemic has disrupted this cozy relationship. Medcan ordered and received 3,000 doses of the scarce H1N1 flu vaccine to service the well-heeled clients on its books.</p>
<p>That's irked those who have to line up for hours in the rain to get their shots from overworked staff at temporary public health clinics.</p>
<p>Provincial Health Minister Deb Matthews, while insisting that she'll look at the issue of preferred access later, has subtly tried to shift any blame to those public health officials who authorized Medcan's vaccine allotment.</p>
<p>But surely the responsibility lies with the succession of provincial governments that allowed Medcan and similar clinics to, in effect, use a legal loophole to circumvent statutory bans on extra-billing for medically necessary services.</p>
<p>In this case a particular necessary medical service (the H1N1 vaccine) is largely available only to those who have already paid an extra out-of-pocket fee.</p>
<p>I say largely, because the politically savvy owners of Medcan (CEO Shaun Francis was chief fundraiser for Conservative supremo Tim Hudak's successful leadership campaign this year) are now allocating 20 per cent of their vaccine on a first-come-first-served basis, to members of the general public on the so-called priority list. All they have to do, says Evans, is email Medcan.</p>
<p>The remainder is to be reserved for the use of Medcan's paying clients - which sounds to me very much like what then Health Minister George Smitherman once decried as "pocketbook medicine."</p>
<p>Six years ago, the McGuinty Liberals promised a law that would make "two-tier, pay-your-way-to the-front-of-the-line health care illegal in Ontario." Alas, it seems they didn't mean it.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Auditor General Sheila Fraser says the Conservative government has dropped the ball in preparing Canada for pandemics and other national emergencies.</p>
<p>The broadside comes amid growing criticism of the federal government's handling of the problem-plagued cross-country H1N1 vaccination plan.</p>
<p>"For H1N1, coordination ... is not as efficient as it could be," Fraser told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>Among other things targeted in her fall report, Fraser said a federal emergency response plan, instead of being implemented, is still in the draft stage after almost six years waiting for Public Safety Canada to get it approved by cabinet.</p>
<p>"We found that the plan has not been formally endorsed by the (Conservative) government or other federal departments," she said in her opening statement to reporters, adding later she had no idea as to why the plan is not approved.</p>
<p>"Canada needs to have a planned and coordinated approach in place so that federal, provincial and municipal agencies know what part they will play in managing a crisis," Fraser said.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan said Canada has been operating under the draft emergency plan even though it's not formally approved, and disputed the suggestions the lack of a plan had anything to do with the government's pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>"Right now, Canada is operating under the pandemic management plan. Health Canada is the lead on that. That plan ... sets out the federal responsibilities, (including) the production of the vaccine in agreement with the provinces," Van Loan said, adding that 6 million doses of vaccine have been produced so far.</p>
<p>Ottawa has reassured Canadians for months there will be enough H1N1 vaccine for all who need and want to be immunized - a promise it still expects to fulfil by the holidays - but hundreds of thousands are growingly increasingly frustrated at delays for getting shots.</p>
<p>"I think we are seeing a rather flagrant example of their lack of preparedness for national emergencies like pandemics with the complete botch-up of the swine flu vaccinations process across the country," said Liberal MP Dominic LeBlanc (Beausejour).</p>
<p>New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton said the auditor general's report "matches what we are seeing right now, which is an unfolding chaos on waiting lines and people having questions about whether they should get vaccinated or not."</p>
<p>"This should have been addressed through a properly executed plan," Layton said.</p>
<p>The auditor's report said Public Safety Canada, established in 2003 to coordinate the government's response to emergencies, has not exercised that leadership role.</p>
<p>"Until it is clearly established how Public Safety Canada will work with other departments, it will be difficult for it to truly coordinate the federal response to emergency situations," Fraser stated.</p>
<p>The report noted that Public Safety Canada has made "considerable progress" in federal emergency coordination through its Government Operations Centre.</p>
<p>"The centre produced regular situation awareness reports for issues such as the H1N1 virus pandemic," the report stated.</p>
<p>The report also questions the government's ability to respond to the aftermath of a chemical, biological or nuclear attack because of a lack of coordinated response and training, and questions why there is no specific plan to protect critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants or power grids.</p>

</p>
<p>There is no silver or bronze medal in the race to host the 2015 Pan Am Games - only gold.</p>
<p>So Premier Dalton McGuinty, who flies to Guadalajara, Mexico Wednesday night for the final push before the winning city is announced Friday, is leaving nothing to chance.</p>
<p>"We're going to champion our cause," said McGuinty, who has travelled to Beijing, Copenhagen, Acapulco and Mexico City to boost Toronto's bid.</p>
<p>The premier, who played down opposition suggestions he remain home to handle the H1N1 flu crisis, hopes his personal lobbying will help best rivals Bogota, Colombia and Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>"I've been on the phone frequently of late, phoning up the various voters in this campaign. We think we've got the strongest bid by far.</p>
<p>"We think we bring a lot of certainty. These are worry-free Games," he said, alluding to concerns about security and infrastructure in Lima and Bogota. "We know how to do these kinds of things; much of our infrastructure is already in place. We have a broad level of commitment from the governments."</p>
<p>Indeed, McGuinty, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Toronto Mayor David Miller and other municipal leaders in and around the GTA are lined up together.</p>
<p>Even though the Progressive Conservatives and NDP support Toronto's bid, there are reservations.</p>
<p>"Clearly, if we are successful in this it can help bring some jobs and some investments to sports and recreation facilities," said Tory Leader Tim Hudak, noting he would expect McGuinty to have dealt with the flu pandemic before boarding his flight.</p>
<p>"I have every confidence that before he leaves he will have a plan in place to ensure clinics have greater opening hours and that pregnant women and children will be able to access the clinics instead of waiting in line for hours," said Hudak.</p>

<p>As H1N1 hysteria grows, some people are trying everything from onions to homeopathy to fend off the vicious bug.</p>
<p>"I'm hearing a lot of people talking about H1N1 and there's a lot of fear out there, that's for sure," says Heather Boon, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies natural health products.</p>
<p>A host of H1N1 prevention techniques and products are circulating on Internet websites and email chains. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been vigilant, sending cease-and-desist letters to companies marketing "fraudulent products" in relation to H1N1, including gels, inhalers, masks, body wash and "air system products."</p>
<p>Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, says she thinks a lot of people are "out to make money out of swine flu."</p>
<p>Novalis Integra Center for Healing and Transformation, an Ottawa-based company, was offering "free swine flu natural immunization" on its website until it was tracked down by the FDA. Co-founder Joyce Friesen says the immunization product is a powder you put under your tongue - an "energetic imprint" of the H1N1 virus created with a "homeopathic resonance system."</p>
<p>Novalis, which received warning letters from the FDA and the Competition Bureau of Canada, is no longer marketing the product on its website.</p>
<p>"It's really unfortunate because homeopathy works and it's a safe and inexpensive alternative and it wouldn't cost the government billions of dollars," Friesen says.</p>
<p>When it comes to homeopathy, McGeer says there are two kinds of people: those who honestly believe their medicine will help, and scammers.</p>
<p>"There's any number of homeopathic remedies and vitamins and herbs ... and a whole list of things that people are trying," she says. But the only things proven to fight H1N1, she says, are vaccination and washing your hands.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Piles of flaming garbage on reserves and drinking water tinged with raw sewage are just two possible consequences of weak environmental enforcement in First Nations communities, says Auditor General Sheila Fraser.</p>
<p>In an audit released Tuesday, Fraser takes the federal government to task for not cracking down as hard on environmental hazards on reserves as it does off reserves.</p>
<p>"A healthy environment and control over the management of land and resources are critical to sustainable economic development," Fraser told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Without them opportunities for First Nations to improve their quality of life and approach the standard of health and well-being enjoyed in other communities are severely limited."</p>
<p>Fraser's findings come as many First Nations communities are bracing for a second bout of H1N1.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus hit a number of remote reserves in Manitoba disproportionately hard this spring, in part because the people there live in close quarters and often in less-than-sanitary conditions.</p>
<p>Protecting the environment in First Nations communities is a responsibility of the federal government under the Indian Act. But Fraser's audit pointed the finger at Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and Environment Canada for falling down on enforcement.</p>
<p>The audit found garbage often isn't dumped in licensed landfill sites and there's no monitoring of the quality of drinking water or air.</p>
<p>"Off reserves, provincial and municipal regulations and enforcement help to prevent such situations."</p>
<p>The Indian and Northern Affairs Department says there are 365 First Nations in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario whose land is managed by the Indian Act. About 150 of those First Nations have agreements with municipalities to handle their solid waste.</p>
<p>The auditors say they expected the department would have issued at least one landfill permit for the rest of the First Nations. But instead, only 14 permits were issued, all in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Fraser's audit also found that the Indian and Northern Affairs Department has no idea how solid waste is disposed of in about 80 First Nations communities.</p>
<p>"We found that the department neither promotes not conducts significant surveillance on reserves to look for illegal dump sites or garbage burning and is not equipped to monitor compliance, conduct inspections, or enforce the regulations," the audit says.</p>
<p>Another problem area identified by the auditors is a lack of rules about dumping sewage into water.</p>
<p>Both Environment Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs say they don't get enough funding to keep on top of all their commitments.</p>

</p>
<p>CALGARY -- The Calgary Flames went into a defensive shell yesterday in the face of an all-out attack from detractors who wanted to know why the NHL team got special H1N1 vaccinations while millions of Canadians have had to stand in line for hours waiting for theirs.</p>
<p>News that the Flames and their family members had been inoculated at a special clinic last Friday created instant uproar and a political scandal at the provincial legislature yesterday. Politicians wanted to know how an NHL team was allowed to jump the queue and called for an investigation while an untold number of Calgarians called the Flames' front office to vent their anger.</p>
<p>The Flames released a statement and answered questions but never acknowledged any wrong doing. “We sought counsel and guidance on this matter and determined it appropriate given the facts available at the time,” the statement said pointing out it had all been arranged through Alberta Health Services. “We accept full responsibility for our actions and decisions.”</p>
<p>When interviewed yesterday, the Flames' players were of the same mindset and insisted they were only following instructions from the team. Flames captain Jarome Iginla said the players didn't believe, or even realize, they were cutting in front of those who may have been in high-risk groups in need of the vaccination.</p>
<p>“For us as a group of players, we were following the medical protocol given to us. Today, we can see … that they're stopping [the inoculations] and that there's a shortage,” Iginla said. “So yeah, we can understand why people might be upset.”</p>
<p>Flames defenceman Robyn Regehr admitted he was “pretty happy” to have received the shot.</p>
<p>“You're hearing all kinds of things – and having to go across the border [the Flames travelled to Dallas yesterday], they say you might need it, so at that point, we had the option and I took it as a player.”</p>
<p>Flames' president Ken King was adamant in his defence of the players saying, “Our players did not seek to avoid a line-up. They didn't ask for special attention, they followed the direction of our physicians, they followed the organization's direction.”</p>
<p>King added the situation concerning the availability of the swine flu shots changed between Friday and yesterday and noted that if the team had asked Alberta Health Service for the shots 72 hours ago it would have been declined.</p>
<p>“I think we would be declined,” King told reporters, “not because of the backlash but because of the change in the need-based distribution program. It's a different program today than it was Friday.”</p>
<p>The Flames are believed to be the only Canadian NHL team to have received vaccinations. In Edmonton, Oilers general manager Steve Tambellini said his team was still waiting to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>“I don't know when we're going to be able to get it. Hopefully soon,” he said.</p>
<p>As many as eight Oilers players – from defenceman Ladislav Smid, the only confirmed case of the H1N1 strain on the team, to centre Shawn Horcoff – have been affected to some degree by the flu.</p>
<p>The Oilers have followed all the NHL's protocols to minimize the spread of flu through the team. In fact, according to Tambellini, they took the pro-active step of introducing precautionary measures back in training camp, knowing that H1N1 could be an issue that they'd need to deal with.</p>
<p>“This isn't something that just happened to us,” Tambellini said. “We've been doing all these things since Say 1 – water bottles for every player, separate towels for every player. Our doctors and training staff have been on it since the start of the year.”</p>
<p>The reaction to the Flames' flu shots was especially contentious in the provincial government, where the Progressive Conservatives have already been under daily attack for their handling of the province's vaccination plan.</p>
<p>Alberta Liberal Leader David Swann called the special clinic set up for the Flames “a violation of the basic principles of public health care.”</p>
<p>Alberta NDP Leader Brian Mason said it was outrageous the government let high-risk groups such as pregnant women and children stand in line for hours to get the shot while a small elite group received it with little effort. “Of course, the owners of the team stand to lose a lot of money if their players all get sick but I don't think that is as important as making sure that a pregnant mother or a child [doesn't] get severely sick or die from H1N1,” Mason said.</p>
<p>Roman Cooney, a spokesman with Alberta Health Services, said the special clinic approved by “staff” for hockey players and their families “should not have happened … I am apologizing for a serious error in judgment.”</p>

</p>
<p>VICTORIA and VANCOUVER -- Most flu clinics in B.C. are expected to close next week while B.C. waits for more vaccine supplies from Ottawa, even as 162 new severe cases have been identified in the province, including three deaths, in the past week.</p>
<p>While the vaccine shortage has meant most school-age children are not yet eligible for the vaccine under B.C.'s priority distribution plan, an outbreak of the flu has closed every school in the district of Kitimat.</p>
<p>School absenteeism rates in Kitimat began to skyrocket last Tuesday, the day before the northern city learned a struggling pulp mill would be closed in the New Year, putting 535 people out of work.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, upwards of 50 per cent of students and teachers were away from city schools, resulting in yesterday's decision by the school district to close schools for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>“Everybody is either staying home because they're afraid of getting it, or they have the symptoms,” Coast Mountains School District chairman Barry Pankhurst said yesterday from Kitimat.</p>
<p>Health worries have added to the sense of gloom in town, where many families are grappling with the question of how they'll pay their bills once the mill closes in January, he added.</p>
<p>Vaccinations were expected to start today in Kitimat.</p>
<p>Five of Mr. Pankhurst's nine grandchildren were home sick yesterday. Schools were to close at the end of the day and are expected to reopen on Monday.</p>
<p>In a nearby native community, more than 400 children and adults were vaccinated for H1N1 at a clinic held by the Kitimaat Village Council on Monday, according to a notice on the council's web site.</p>
<p>The council has closed its community school, a seniors' centre and a recreation centre to help prevent the spread of the virus, and has asked people who were selling baked goods from their homes to stop doing so for a week.</p>
<p>In Victoria, provincial health officer Perry Kendall could not say when B.C. will have enough vaccine to offer flu shots to the general public.</p>
<p>“We are obviously having challenges with our vaccine supply,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>“We hope to hear that vaccine volumes will go up again soon so that in subsequent weeks we can really ramp the program up again. The delay in offering the vaccine isn't what anybody hoped to see.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall said the surge in severe cases was expected, but it is putting pressure on emergency rooms.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority issued a public notice yesterday in response to emergency rooms that have been swamped with people who are showing mild to moderate symptoms of the flu. It asked people to think twice about coming to hospitals if their symptoms are not severe.</p>
<p>“Many patients who are presenting with flu-like symptoms are well enough to be cared for at home and don't need to visit the ER,” health officials said.</p>
<p>The three people who have died since Oct. 27 were adults with other health conditions. Since April, 15 people in B.C. who had H1N1 have died, and only one did not have an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall said he expects the 818,000 doses of the vaccine now in B.C. delivered to communities by next week, allowing health officials to target those at highest risk for health reasons as well as “mission-critical” health care workers.</p>
<p>“I'd like to acknowledge those British Columbians who are staying back because they are not in the high risk group.”</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Ottawa has not moved quickly enough to get ready for pandemics, natural disasters and terrorist attacks that can cause major damage to the country, the Auditor-General said yesterday.</p>
<p>Sheila Fraser said the government still reacts to matters such as the H1N1 pandemic or major blackouts on a “case-by-case basis,” eight years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States highlighted the need to prepare for emergencies.</p>
<p>Ms. Fraser said the Department of Public Safety, created in 2003 to co-ordinate how different branches of the federal government work together in emergencies, has not carved out the appropriate leadership role.</p>
<p>“Canada needs to have a planned and co-ordinated approach in place so that federal, provincial and municipal agencies know what part they will play in managing a crisis,” Ms. Fraser told reporters.</p>
<p>The opposition jumped in, saying Ottawa's lack of preparedness is to blame for the confusion over the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>“[The current H1N1 crisis] confirms what people are experiencing, confusion and a lack of co-ordination. Why can the government not get its act together?” NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis said in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan, however, insisted that Ottawa must defer to lower levels of government in emergency planning.</p>
<p>“We have worked well with the provinces and territories, who we know are, of course, primarily responsible for the delivery of emergency and disaster management,” Mr. Van Loan said.</p>
<p>Ottawa started working on an “all-hazards approach” in 2004, meaning it wanted to be prepared to respond to any emergency, regardless of whether the cause was natural, accidental or malicious.</p>
<p>However, Public Safety Canada has had problems meetings its goals because of high turnover in its senior ranks. In the previous fiscal year, it had a 39-per-cent vacancy rate among its senior managers.</p>
<p>While massive floods or cyber-attacks have a “low probability of occurrence,” the government has to be ready given their “high potential impact,” the report said.</p>
<p>Ms. Fraser criticized the government for failing to compile a thorough list of the critical infrastructure that needs to be protected in Canada. As it stands, both Natural Resources Canada and Public Safety Canada are involved in mapping the country's strategic resources.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- The H1N1 vaccine is arriving too late for a remote native reserve in Northern Ontario, where one in 15 people are already sick with symptoms of the virus and the toll is climbing daily.</p>
<p>Four young children on the Kashechewan Reserve were confirmed with the H1N1 virus last Wednesday, two days before the fly-in community north of Timmins received enough vaccine for just over half of its 1,500 residents.</p>
<p>But as the rest of the community waits for their shots, about 100 residents have become sick with flu-like symptoms, and the number is growing daily, said Kashechewan Chief Jonathan Solomon. He has temporarily closed the two schools and is advising all visitors to postpone their travel plans.</p>
<p>Kashechewan is not alone. It's a similar story in other communities along the coast of James Bay, where inadequate housing in which multiple families are squeezed in together and chronic health conditions make them breeding grounds for the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Stan Beardy, Grand Chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, said the federal government pledged to provide his 49 communities – identified as a priority group – with enough vaccine to inoculate everyone as soon as Ottawa began shipping vials to the provinces. But many of the communities have received less than half the doses they ordered, he said.</p>
<p>And it takes at least a week after the flu shot for the vaccine to become effective.</p>
<p>Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, acknowledged yesterday that the remote northern communities were at the top of the list for getting vaccine.</p>
<p>“We're doing the best we can to try to prevent outbreaks in these communities,” Dr. King told reporters yesterday.</p>

<p>VICTORIA -- A Suburban truck headed out of Good Hope Lake, B.C., yesterday, loaded to capacity with seven members of the Dease River Band for a two-hour drive to the nearest town in search of H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>Residents of the isolated native community in northern B.C. are among those who are supposed to be at the front of the line for vaccination against the H1N1 flu virus. But provincial health officer Perry Kendall cannot say how many of the 70,000 flu shots earmarked for on-reserve aboriginal people have made it yet to those who need it most.</p>
<p>“Are they waiting until people die?” Dease River band official Albert Etzerza asked. “All this talk about the coming to remote communities, it is b.s.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall said 70,000 units of vaccine have been allocated for people on native reserves across B.C. – enough to cover the entire on-reserve population – and he expects all of those doses will have been delivered by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Where clinics have been provided, he said, between 80 and 90 per cent of the reserve populations have been inoculated.</p>
<p>“But I don't know if we have reached half the communities or three-quarters of the communities,” Dr. Kendall said.</p>
<p>And even places that have had clinics have experienced vaccine shortages.</p>
<p>Chief Doug Kelly of the Soowahlie Indian Band near Chilliwack attended a community clinic last Wednesday night where just 40 shots were available.</p>
<p>“We had to turn many people away,” he said yesterday. Chief Kelly spent the day in a native health conference, where he heard similar stories of native community nurses running out of the vaccine.</p>
<p>“First nations citizens understand the need, they appreciate the precaution of taking the vaccine,” he said. With overcrowding and other problems with on-reserve housing, he added, people living on both rural and urban reserves need to limit their exposure.</p>
<p>British Columbia has received enough doses of the vaccine to cover all of its high-risk population, an estimated 800,000 people, including pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>This week, the list was expanded to cover front-line health workers, caregivers for babies, and children aged six months to five years, but in some parts of the province, those people are still being asked to wait.</p>
<p>The Northern Health Authority is still working through the first group with the 23,000 doses received last week.</p>
<p>Eryn Collins, a spokesperson for the health authority, said the focus remains on the first priority groups until more vaccine comes in.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC / DR. DAVID BUTLER-JONES</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>A calm demeanour and a Mickey Mouse watch; Canada's Chief Public Health Officer acknowledges complaints of public, but is mainly pleased with the H1N1 inoculation roll-out so far</b>
</div><div>PAUL WALDIE   </div>
<div>827 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>Whenever David Butler-Jones heads out to work as Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, he sports one of his favourite accessories – a Mickey Mouse watch.</p>
<p>“I have Mickey and Goofy watches because I always figure it's nice to have something that doesn't quite fit,” Dr. Butler-Jones said yesterday, adding that one Goofy watch turns backwards.</p>
<p>“I just like the idea that I can be very formal, I can be whatever I am, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, but I still can appreciate Goofy.”</p>
<p>In his leather coats and oddball watches, Dr. Butler-Jones has become the public face of the federal government's effort to fight the H1N1 virus, patiently explaining the massive effort and why it is taking so long. Many Canadians facing long waits for shots might have a hard time picturing Canada's top doctor using a Goofy watch to tell time, but Dr. Butler-Jones said it's just who he is.</p>
<p>“I'm just not that kind of guy to be coiffed with nice suits. There's always got to be something that's just not quite right,” he said. The leather jackets were the idea of his ex-wife, Susan. She “bought me a leather jacket one year, and I found them really comfortable [and] they travel well, you can bunch them up.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, as he sipped a latte on a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> patio in Vancouver, Dr. Butler-Jones maintained an air of calm amid a storm of complaints about the government's handling of the H1N1 crisis.</p>
<p>Yes, there have been frustration and delays, he said, but over all, the plan has gone remarkably well. “This is the largest immunization campaign in history,” he explained. “Some [provincial] jurisdictions have already immunized more people in a week and a bit than they normally do in a whole flu season … It's frustrating for people, but it's also a remarkable accomplishment.”</p>
<p>As for politicians who have slammed the program, he said Canada's pandemic response program has been in the works for years, and “they should be crowing about it not criticizing it, actually.”</p>
<p>He acknowledged that he and other health officials were caught off guard by the public response to the vaccine.</p>
<p>“To some extent, you can predict that if you have a really good sale at Future Shop, there's going to be along lineup, or if there are tickets for Duran Duran, you're going to have a long lineup,” he said.</p>
<p>“We really, quite honestly, weren't expecting quite the lineups for vaccines. … Maybe we should have, but given all the signs before that, it looked like our biggest challenge would be convincing people to get out and get the vaccine.”</p>
<p>When asked whether he had second thoughts about the program, Dr. Butler-Jones offered some critiques.</p>
<p>He questioned the way some health regions have doled out shots, failing to vaccinate those most at risk first, as his office recommended. He expressed some frustration at the inability of GlaxoSmithKline Inc. to produce as much vaccine as promised last week because of a production glitch. And he suggested the government may have to consider other vaccine suppliers in future, instead of only <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>But Dr. Butler-Jones refused to assign blame. Delays were inevitable, he said, given the complexities of the production process, and everything will be back to normal in a week or so. He is worried about the growing public anxiety. “Nobody should be afraid that there won't be enough vaccine. And, those that are at low risk can wait, because the risk from this flu, for most of us at low risk, is no greater than the flu that we take for granted every year.”</p>
<p>Born in Toronto, Dr. Butler-Jones, 55, studied at the University of Toronto, earning a medical degree and a postgraduate degree in community health. He planned to go to Africa to work in a church-run mission, but was asked to go to Newfoundland instead.</p>
<p>He went on to serve as a medical officer of health in a variety of communities in Ontario and Saskatchewan before becoming the latter province's chief medical health officer in 2002. He also teaches at the University of Manitoba and University of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>In 2004, then-prime-minister Paul Martin named him Canada's first Chief Public Health Officer. While the job has taxed his personal life – his marriage ended two years ago and he is rarely at his home in Winnipeg – the work has been gratifying.</p>
<p>He recently received a two-year extension to his job. Asked whether he would stay beyond 2011, he replied: “Probably. We'll take one year at a time at the moment.”</p>

<p>Aurora, Ont. -- Medcan member Mitch Finkelstein says of the problems surrounding public access to the H1N1 vaccine: “Quite frankly, I think this kind of proves socialized health care doesn't work.” I think it kind of proves that Mr. Finkelstein has no idea how many people depend on socialized health care – the only health care available to them.

<p>Toronto -- I can sympathize with Medcan member Kim Goodman's wish to have her two children vaccinated (Private Clinics Offer Opportunity For A Few – Nov. 3). I really want to have my two-year-old vaccinated but my family doctor hasn't yet received the vaccine and I can't stand in a lineup for a public clinic, given I also have a five-week-old to care for.</p>
<p>I wonder what Toronto Public Health's view will be of Medcan for not vaccinating only those individuals in the high priority groups at this time. As far as I can tell from TPH's website, Ms. Goodman's vaccinated seven-year-old doesn't fall within the high priority group.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry and Toronto Public Health should recall the vaccine from private clinics and distribute it to family doctors who are waiting for the H1N1 vaccine for their patients. Two-tiered health care does not belong in Canada.</p>

<p>Toronto -- The Ontario government is facing a record budget deficit. Ontario is facing a temporary H1N1 vaccine shortage. Economic theory suggests that one “fair” way of determining who is first in line for the vaccine is to auction off those rights for cash.</p>
<p>It might be better than people taking time off work and standing in line for hours. At least the government gets the money, not the operators of private health clinics.</p>

<p>Guelph, Ont. -- I recognize the seriousness of H1N1, and will likely get a flu shot in due time, but not when I have to wait in lineups sitting on a lawn chair and deal with police having to control the mobs. I'm beginning to think people have lost their rational minds.</p>
<p>The odds of dying from H1N1 range from one in 100,000 to one in 250,000. How many Canadians are going to die from cancer, from Type 2 diabetes, from heart disease?</p>
<p>Many, many times more. So why aren't people lined up at the gym or on the hiking trails, why aren't they throwing away their cartons of cigarettes, why aren't they lined up at the fresh food section of groceries?</p>

<p>Toronto -- Thank you for the information on Medcan's offer to make some of its vaccine available to the public. As a group of four physicians with more than 1,000 high-risk patients in downtown Toronto and no vaccine, we've told our patients to go to Medcan for their H1N1 vaccine.

<p>Canada is heading into one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, and the H1N1 pandemic means travellers will have to consider possible cancellations or flu screenings in foreign destinations. Here are your Canadian travel questions answered:</p>
<p>I am about to fly overseas and I cared for my son while he was sick with the virus. Am I safe to travel?</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has said countries should not restrict travel across their borders, because the virus has already spread around the world. But last week, the federal government issued new advice telling Canadians to avoid travel – particularly long trips – if they have influenza-like symptoms, including sore throat, cough, fever, aches and fatigue. The government is also advising crew members to avoid travel if they are sick. Public-health officials say people should take measures to avoid spreading the virus, such as washing their hands frequently and using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>If I'm in a foreign country and get word my child is ill with H1N1, can I get a discounted or emergency rate to return?</p>
<p>Travel companies may allow special rates on a case-by-case basis. Last week, the federal government urged them to develop policies to make it easier for passengers to rebook their travel. FlightNetwork.com had been urging passengers to purchase travel insurance, but announced Tuesday it would waive cancellation and rebooking fees during flu season, up to April 1, 2010. The move won't protect passengers from any cancellation or rebooking fees charged by airlines, however. Air Canada, WestJet and some major tour operators say a passenger's best bet is to purchase travel insurance when booking a trip. Many have existing policies allowing people to change bookings, usually for a fee.</p>

For a sample of both ends of the fashion spectrum, you can't beat Apgujeong and the adjacent Cheongdam Fashion District – for international brands and South Korean labels – and Dongdaemun Shopping Mall Town, for quality fakes as well as edgy fashion-forward designers. If you've got the money and stamina, it's easy enough to do both districts in one day, thanks to the excellent subway and affordable taxis.</p>
<p>Apgujeong and Cheongdam Fashion District This area, south of the Han River, which bisects the city, features broad tree-lined streets and twisty laneways full of retail treasures. It offers the ultimate in upmarket shopping, with all the usual suspects from Prada to <span class="companylink">Jil Sander</span>. Ladies who lunch flock here from all over Asia.</p>
<p>If you visit at night, check out the façade of the posh Galleria department store (www.galleria.co.kr[http://www.galleria.co.kr]), which anchors the area. With 4,300 glass discs pumping out 16 million colours of light, Galleria lights up the night as multicoloured waves crash across its shiny skin.</p>
<p>But to make a day of it, start at Butterfinger Pancakes, an American-style diner, for chocolate pancakes (82 (2) 3448-1070). Then hit the nearby Designer Shoe Alley (between Galleria and Gucci) for South Korean designer shoes in wild styles that won't be in North America for another year.</p>
<p>Duck into Whoo Spa Palace for a ritzy rubdown using herbs and massage techniques developed for the Korean royal family (82-8-0022-0303). Later, Xian (82-2-512-1998) is an elegant choice for dinner, with its silk-hung dining room and food that flawlessly combines Asian and continental influences.</p>
<p>For a late night on the town, try Platoon Kunsthalle (82-2-3447-1191; www.kunsthalle.com[http://www.kunsthalle.com]), dedicated to street art, club culture and political action while featuring four concurrent exhibits, a resto-bar and an event hall where DJs spin.</p>
<p>Apgujeong Station, Subway Line 3; Cheongdam Station, Subway Line 7.</p>
<p>Dongdaemun Shopping Mall Town Located near the Great East Gate in central Seoul, Dongdaemun is one part village market and one part city of the future. There are street stalls selling cheap goods, a bustling wholesale market, and 20 high-rise malls in fancifully designed structures ranging from glass cylinders to neon-trimmed pyramids. Doota (www.doota.com[http://www.doota.com]) is the craziest of these – shopping as funhouse experience. (Its motto is “FASHION IS WAR!”)</p>
<p>Once the young crowd has pushed you past the entrance court where a Korean-pop boy band covers the Arctic Monkeys' Scummy Man, eight floors await, with 1,400 packed-in boutiques featuring everything from young Korean designers (in Basement 1), as well as high quality luxury knock-offs. The third floor's bag and shoe offerings – Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu – are staggering and plausible.</p>
<p>But finding anything in particular demands patience. The stores, packed cheek by jowl, are really stalls and stands, nooks and crannies – all of them open-fronted and most no more than three metres wide, merchandise so thickly stacked and hung and otherwise arrayed that shopping becomes a true treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Often the shoppers themselves are more fascinating than the fashion, hunting in prides up and down the heavily mirrored escalators. They cry out in ecstasy over dresses so layered, flapped and zipped you could camp out in them – and the best T-shirts anywhere. I fought a 13-year-old boy for a “TOUCH ME I'M SICK” tee (South Korea has thousands of H1N1 cases), but one of his confreres gave me a tae kwon do sucker chop and all was lost. Dongaemun Subway Station, Subway Line 4. Some malls are open 24 hours a day, while others open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>

</p>
<p>Why did the approximately 300 people on the Olympic torch team receive the H1N1 vaccine ahead of the people most at risk, who include our children?</p>
<p>According to the Health Canada website, it can take up to 10 days for the vaccine to work fully in an individual. The "chosen 300" could potentially spread the virus for up to 10 days, based on when they received the vaccination.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Stanwick says he decided to give the torch team the H1N1 vaccine because torchbearers will take the flame to remote First Nations communities.</p>
<p>If Stanwick is concerned about spreading the virus, given the shortage of vaccine, why did he not recommend that the 300 be tested for the virus? Anyone who tested positive could be replaced with an uninfected alternate. In addition, health officials could ensure that the remote First Nations communities which are truly at risk receive the vaccine before the 300 people involved in the torch relay.</p>
<p>I realize that the test takes time, but it's not like the H1N1 flu is a surprise. If cost is the issue, maybe Vanoc could cancel one or two of their private gala events to pay for it.</p>
<p>If health officials were thinking of their social responsibilities, they would ensure that the young and immune-compromised would be the first to receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>This once again looks like "the show must go on" at any price, except this time it is the ones who are most vulnerable who are paying for the show.</p>

</p>
<p>So what's the real reason striking paramedics have been legislated back to work? The NDP says it's the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>In the B.C. legislature yesterday, NDP labour critic Raj Chouhan released a memo to the government from the Vancouver organizing committee's director of medical services, Dr. Mike Wilkinson, warning of the consequences if paramedics' services couldn't be guaranteed.</p>
<p>"Vanoc Medical Services ... requires definitive confirmation by Oct. 1, 2009, that all required ambulance services will be provided as planned," Wilkinson writes in the memo. "This confirmation must also include a guarantee that no services during the Games will be disrupted or reduced."</p>
<p>Wilkinson suggests the government either settle the strike or legislate an end to the dispute, or face the possible cancellation of the Olympics.</p>
<p>Chouhan accused the government of letting Vanoc run the province.</p>
<p>Health Minister Kevin Falcon, who introduced Bill 21 Monday to legislate a settlement, didn't deny the Games played a part in his decision.</p>
<p>But Falcon said the H1N1 virus was the primary motivator.</p>
<p>B.C. Federation of Labour president Jim Sinclair said the dispute should have gone to arbitration, as the paramedics had requested.</p>

<p>Education Minister Margaret MacDiarmid was rushed to hospital recently after the onset of a searing headache.</p>
<p>Within a few hours, she was unresponsive, and doctors were pumping antibiotics into her bloodstream while telling her family she had about a one-in-five chance of dying.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid, 52, has pneumococcal meningitis, a rare and very serious infection that affects on average one or two out of every 100,000 people each year in Canada.</p>
<p>Yesterday, MacDiarmid said she has improved dramatically in the 11 days since the incident and is recovering at home. She added that experts anticipate a full recovery, but say it can take a month for people to get back to full strength.</p>
<p>"It happens catastrophically quickly," MacDiarmid said yesterday of pneumococcal meningitis.</p>
<p>"It's really a life-and-death emergency."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said the headache began on the evening of Oct. 23, while she was having dinner with her brother's family.</p>
<p>"I got up to play a game with my niece," recalled MacDiarmid, who was a family doctor for 23 years before getting into politics.</p>
<p>"And suddenly," she said, "I felt like the top of my head was going to blow off."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid said she was reluctant to go to the hospital, especially because of the pressures being put on the health system by the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>But her brother, Andy MacDiarmid, an internist from Winnipeg, knew better.</p>
<p>"It was my brother who looked at me -- he'd been with me all day -- and he actually said within about five or 10 minutes, 'I think you have meningitis and we need to call 9-1-1,' " she said.</p>
<p>By the time an ambulance had taken her to hospital, she was completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>MacDiarmid was discharged Thursday from hospital, but must take intravenous antibiotics for 14 days.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Three more die from H1N1 in B.C.; Officials await autopsy results to see if Island death related to virus</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts, Judith Lavoie and Jeff Bell   </div>
<div>Times Colonist; with files from Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>H1N1 swine flu has killed at least three more people on the Lower Mainland, bringing B.C.'s total fatalities to 15, B.C.'s chief medical officer said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall said three people have died since Oct. 27, two from the Fraser Health Region and one from the Vancouver Coastal Region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials are awaiting autopsy results to determine if H1N1 was involved in the death Monday of a 37-year old man from the Saanich Peninsula. Gordon Jack was a member of the Pauquachin First Nation, near Sidney, and is believed to have lived on the Tsartlip reserve.</p>
<p>Kendall said yesterday First Nations people make up about seven per cent of cases involving hospitalization, yet only represent about 4.5 per cent of the population. "[That] isn't surprising given the higher levels of chronic underlying illness in that population."</p>
<p>Kendall said about 70,000 of the 800,000 doses of vaccine B.C. expects to have received by the end of this week have been reserved for First Nations people, enough to cover the entire native population.</p>
<p>Reports from B.C.'s 203 First Nations communities indicate people are turning out in high numbers to be vaccinated. One of the 15 deaths in B.C. so far was a woman from the Beecher Bay First Nation.</p>
<p>More than 360 severe cases have been admitted to hospitals provincewide, with 63 in intensive care units. Kendall said before the second wave is over, he expects the province will experience fewer than 50 deaths from H1N1, compared with 200 to 800 deaths from seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>The second wave won't likely peak for at least two weeks, said Kendall, who estimates about 10 per cent of British Columbians have been infected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lineups continued at immunization clinics yesterday at the University of Victoria and at the Pauquachin First Nation. Target groups this week are children aged six months to five, some front-line health care workers and people living with infants under six months or those with immunity problems. Pregnant women and people under 65 with chronic health conditions also continue to be eligible.</p>
<p>Next week, the number of vaccine doses available is expected to drop to about 65,000 as manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> deals with production problems.</p>
<p>Kendall said absenteeism is starting to make life difficult in some B.C. hospitals. Overcrowding of emergency rooms is a bigger problem for Island hospitals, as people turn up with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>In southern Vancouver Island schools, the Sooke district's Crystal View Elementary appears to be hardest hit, with about 25 per cent of its 220 students absent. The normal level of absenteeism this time of year is about six to seven per cent. Two other elementary schools -- Poirier and John Stubbs -- have absentee rates more than 10 per cent above normal.</p>
<p>"If it's over 10 per cent above normal, then we send in a report [to health authorities] and we do the enhanced cleaning," said Sooke assistant superintendent Ron Warder.</p>
<p>Neither the Greater Victoria nor the Saanich school districts report a significant change in absentee rates.</p>
<p>In other H1N1 news:</p>
<p>- The Public Health Agency of Canada reported yesterday that the national death toll is now 101.</p>
<p>- The Alberta government is investigating how most players on the Calgary Flames -- along with families, coaching staff and management -- received vaccine shots in private last week, while thousands of Albertans stood in the cold for hours to be inoculated.</p>
<p>ISLAND FLU-SHOT CLINICS TODAY</p>
<p>H1N1 flu shots are only being given this week to people in high-risk groups, including:</p>
<p>- people under age 65 with chronic health conditions, such as asthma and diabetes</p>
<p>- pregnant women</p>
<p>- people living in rural and isolated settings</p>
<p>- children between six months and five years old</p>
<p>- some health-care workers</p>
<p>- people in household contact with infants less than six months old</p>

<p>BEST NONCHALANCE</p>
<p>"It's the same thing as every year ... it's the flu. It's a different form of the flu. But during past years we didn't want our players to get sick and we don't our players to get sick this year. It's a cold."</p>
<p>- Alain Vigneault, seemingly unconcerned about H1N1.</p>
<p>BEST TWEET</p>
<p>@Goro87: Why don't they try Bieksa as a forward? He's always pinching every game anyway, except as a forward it wouldn't be as bad.</p>
<p>- This came Tuesday morning. By game time, the Canucks gave this tweeter his wish.</p>
<p>BEST SONG</p>
<p>During the first intermission, fans heard a near-full version of the Rolling Stones' bluesy, brilliant "Casino Boogie." It's from their epic album Exile on Main St., which Phish spectacularly covered live, in its entirety, last week.</p>
<p>BEST JERK SAUCE</p>
<p>In Vancouver for the only time before the Olympics, John Tortorella, an assistant coach with Team USA, refused to answer any questions about the Games. Nice. Meanwhile, about a week ago, Detroit's Mike Babcock, head coach of Team Canada, answered every question and did so with class and eloquence.</p>

<div>The Province</div>
<div>876 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A56</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>There is a point -- and the Vancouver Canucks limped past that point about three weeks ago, presumably in a walking cast -- when you almost have to laugh.</p>
<p>Michael Grabner breaks his ankle playing soccer before a game? Sure. Call-ups to call-ups get injured, as was the case with Alex Bolduc? Why not? You dress eight defencemen and 10 forwards because they represent about the only healthy bodies you've got? Hey, you've got to do what you've got to do.</p>
<p>We could go on. If Mario Bliznak goes down, the call-up to the call-up to the call-up will have been injured, surely an NHL record.</p>
<p>But by now you get the message.</p>
<p>"I don't know if we can blame it on the schedule or what," Darcy Hordichuk said before Tuesday night's game against the New York Rangers. "But it's tough. This is the most I've seen on one team."</p>
<p>"We're shuffling them through on shifts right now but there's only so many hours in a day," says Mike Burnstein, the Canucks' trainer. "I think the guys can tell by my demeanour that I'm working hard to keep a positive attitude. Some days that's hard. But we're doing OK."</p>
<p>Which must be a relative term. Tuesday night, for example, marked the appearance of Matt Pettinger, who started this season skating with the East Coast league's Victoria Salmon Kings before he signed a 25-game contract with the AHL's Manitoba Moose. Pettinger thus became the 20th forward to dress for the Canucks this season -- that's counting blueliners Aaron Rome and Matt Schneider, who've been employed in Alain Vigneault's imaginative new formations -- and that number will go up if Pavol Demitra ever gets back in the lineup.</p>
<p>But let's look at the bright side. Sami Salo, who's played in three straight games, is now working on an ironman streak. And Jannik Hansen -- remember him? -- is close to returning.</p>
<p>"We have to keep our guys focused on the day-to-day," said Vigneault. "We've got to come up with the best plan to give us the best chance to win on that particular day. This has been going since Day 1 of the regular season. We're going to continue to do that as long as we're faced with this situation."</p>
<p>Vigneault was then asked if that means his team will have to play a certain style -- i.e., defence-first, last and always -- until they start to get some bodies back.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, before pausing for effect. "Yes."</p>
<p>The Canucks, in fact, are to be commended for hanging around the .500 mark given their current state of health. For the last month, Vigneault has essentially cobbled together his lineup based on that night's availability and the team has been three games over .500 since Daniel Sedin went down with a broken foot in Game 4.</p>
<p>True, it hasn't exactly been an aesthetic success but under the circumstances, it's been more than acceptable. That also raises the question: Where do the Canucks go from here? And that's where things get interesting.</p>
<p>There's a tendency to assume the team is simply concentrating its allotment of injuries for the season in its first 20 games and there's some comfort in that. Assuming that's the case, you can envision a Canucks team with Robert Luongo, Sedin, Demitra and others playing together without interruption over the final four months of the season, and that would be a formidable group.</p>
<p>But there's also something disturbing about this season; something which suggests the current situation isn't an aberration. This, we remind you, is an Olympic year, which means games are compressed into an uncomfortably tight schedule. As for H1N1, it would seem its full effect has yet to be felt around the league.</p>
<p>You only have to look elsewhere at the alarming list of the fallen to understand there are dark forces at work in the NHL. Of the superstar ilk there's Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, Ilya Kovalchuk, Eric Staal, Luongo and Marian Hossa. There's another level of stars in Marc Savard, Johan Franzen, Sergei Gonchar, Simon Gagne and Sedin. And another group of young guns including Shea Weber, David Booth, Jonathan Toews and Valtteri Filppula.</p>
<p>"It's kind of inevitable there will be more injuries when the game is going as fast as it is and bodies are as big as they are," said Canucks goalie Andrew Raycroft.</p>
<p>Inevitable? Maybe. But that doesn't make it any less disturbing.</p>

forward Michael Grabner has joined a long list of teammates on the
injury list after fracturing his ankle during a pregame warmup. The
Canucks' injuries woes, however, don't seem to be restricted to the
team, with a slew of players from around the league such as
Chicago's Jonathan Toews and Washington's Alex Ovechkin having
recently fallen victim to the injury bug.

<p>It is not enough during the week leading up to the biggest game of the season for the Lions that Wally Buono also is worrying whether the fridge door in the office lunch room at Camp Surrey is being wiped down for germs daily.</p>
<p>For once, however, the coach/GM of the CFL team is being justifiably paranoid. Flu season has hit smack in the middle of playoff season.</p>
<p>Trainer Bill Reichelt said some 12 players have been hit with some form of sore throat or flu symptoms that seem to grow worse by the day. Starters Korey Banks, Geroy Simon and JoJuan Armour were all told to stay away from practice Tuesday, though all are expected to play against the Eskimos Friday.</p>
<p>"We're all getting it at once," quarterback Buck Pierce said.</p>
<p>The only player with a confirmed case of the H1N1 flu, Reichelt said, is reserve lineman Damone Duckett, who returned to practice Tuesday after being away last week.</p>
<p>But the Lions have stockpiled quantities of the resistance drug Tamiflu, players with asthmatic conditions are being given inoculations and Buono is preaching washing hands and drinking extra fluids before dissecting the passing habits of Ricky Ray.</p>
<p>"We're not taking any chances," Reichelt said.</p>
<p>The club's only planned roster changes, aside from the return of safety Barron Miles, is to start rookie Martell Mallett ahead of tailback A.J. Harris, although rookie Scott McCuaig could return on special teams.</p>
