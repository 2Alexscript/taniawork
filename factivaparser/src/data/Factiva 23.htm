<p>For the first time since the economy sunk into a troubling recession late last year, health care has emerged as the leading issue for Albertans, according to a new poll.</p>
<p>Following a number of medical controversies--including hospital bed cuts -- 32 per cent of Albertans consider health care to be the province's most important issue, says the <span class="companylink">Environics Research Group</span> survey provided exclusively to the Herald.</p>
<p>"Health care is sort of our <span class="companylink">apple</span>-pie issue . . . as Canadians and as Albertans, and so whenever there's a threat to the system, people become concerned," Environics pollster Tony Coulson said Thursday.</p>
<p>The economy remains a key concern, however.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,000 Albertans shows 29 per cent of residents identify economic issues as a leading concern.</p>
<p>But the telephone survey, conducted Oct. 19 to 31, found at least some of the financial doom and gloom is beginning to ebb.</p>
<p>Nineteen per cent of Albertans believe the economy is getting stronger, up from 11 per cent a year ago.</p>
<p>Though 32 per cent of respondents believe the economy is getting weaker, that's better than the 40 per cent figure the poll found in October 2008.</p>
<p>Just less than half of Albertans-- 45 per cent--believe the economy is staying about the same.</p>
<p>"The broad sentiment is the economy is going to chug a long for a while and hopefully growth will return before too long," Coulson said.</p>
<p>Like many Albertans, the economy was top of mind Thursday for Premier Ed Stelmach.</p>
<p>Stelmach acknowledged the hardships the downturn has brought.</p>
<p>"It is a significant recession. We realize that and we're going to keep ensuring that we're working with Albertans," Stelmach said.</p>
<p>Yet health-care concerns have emerged as the leading issue.</p>
<p>Though currently viewed by about a third of Albertans as the most important issue in the province, only a fifth of respondents held that position last year at this time.</p>
<p>However, since the fall of 2008, the provincial government has had to shrink spending as it deals with the impact of a slumping world economy and weaker energy prices.</p>
<p>Last month, the province's health superboard asked employees to take a two-year wage freeze. In September, the board revealed plans to shut 290 Calgary and Edmonton acute care beds when it moves seniors from hospitals into nursing homes.</p>
<p>"I know right now the buzz is about H1N1, the flu, and there is some of that (in the poll), but it doesn't account for that whole jump," Coulson said.</p>
<p>Val Crompton, a Calgary grandmother who brought her two grand-kids to a northeast clinic Thursday for an H1N1 shot, said uncertainty surrounding the medical system is what has many Albertans concerned.</p>
<p>"With health care you never know what to expect," said Crompton. "Are they going to do your hip or not?Will your kids get their shots or not?"</p>
<p>On the economy, Coulson said views across the province were largely consistent, calling it a "wait-and-see" mood. The poll found 59 per cent of Albertans are not worried about the overall economic situation, while 41 per cent are worried.</p>
<p>Adam Legge, chief economist at Calgary Economic Development, still expects another 12 to 16 months of volatility in the economy.</p>
<p>"As energy prices, and most notably natural gas, ebb and flow, I think we're going to still see a very significant layer of uncertainty around people's views on the economy," he said.</p>
<p>No other issues resonated with Albertans in a big way in the poll. Despite intense international focus on the oilsands, only three per cent of respondents named the environment as the top issue.</p>
<p>Roger Gibbins, president of the Canada West Foundation, a public-policy think-tank, noted that environmental concerns have disappeared from polling data in the United States. "You at least begin to wonder if public support for greater action on the environment was a product of good times," Gibbins said.</p>
<p>The Environics survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 95 times out of 100.</p>

<p>Calgary-Egmont MLA Jonathan Denis will vote for "the boss"-- Premier Ed Stelmach--in Saturday's leadership review. But he isn't sure his riding delegates will follow.</p>
<p>"I know they'll vote their conscience and you never can tell with a secret ballot," says Denis, one of the young MLAs who came to office with the premier last March 3.</p>
<p>Such uncertainly is rampant in a Tory party dazed by mishaps, from royalties to recession, ministers' pay hikes, swine flu foul-ups and plunging polls.</p>
<p>And yet, it would be shocking for party members to force a leadership convention on a premier who won 72 of 83 seats only 20 months ago.</p>
<p>Stelmach's backers say the party would literally be throwing its mandate to the wolves. And the soaring Wildrose Alliance might be there to snap it up.</p>
<p>But public feeling has turned so powerfully against the government, and Stelmach himself, that hostile votes might lurk behind the uneasy smiles of party members.</p>
<p>"We think he should be fine, but that's predicated on people telling us the truth about how they intend to vote," says one of Stelmach's loyalists.</p>
<p>The latest poll showing the Tories at only 34 per cent, compared with 28 per cent for the fledgling Wildrose party, suggests public support is still dropping. And that survey was done before the flu shot uproar hit Alberta.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the Stelmach camp says it would be madness to dump the premier with no successor in sight and two years remaining before an election.</p>
<p>They recall that Ralph Klein's polls were far worse--about 17 per cent--in the spring of 1993.</p>
<p>The Liberals under Laurence Decore were far ahead and seemed certain to win the impending election.</p>
<p>But Klein made dramatic moves --notably dumping MLA pensions-- that quickly turned sentiment around. He won his first election in June and went on to a legendary career.</p>
<p>Stelmach's position isn't nearly as dire, his backers say. He already has a majority and the economy could be roaring again in two years.</p>
<p>But the people who want Stelmach kicked out worry about a deeper problem; the fading lustre of the Tory "brand."</p>
<p>Critics like Calgary Tory Alan Hallman say the premier is dragging down the party he leads, and the damage may be irreversible.</p>
<p>To this group, dumping Ed and replacing him with an fresh, able leader is the only escape. The problem they have is identifying that leader.</p>
<p>Between the extremes of pro-Ed and anti-Ed sentiment wander many uncertain Tories who will make up their minds at the convention.</p>
<p>"I want to do what's right for the party, the province and the government," says one of the dazed, "but I still can't figure out what the heck that is."</p>
<p>Another influential Calgary Tory has decided to vote for Stelmach, "but only on the understanding that there will be big changes."</p>
<p>"If he doesn't make those changes, we'll have a serious conversation later on about him getting out of the way for somebody else."</p>
<p>As the Tories focus on their party's navel, they risk further alienating the voters.</p>
<p>High support for Stelmach-- 85 per cent, say--could convince Albertans the party doesn't care about the feelings of the general public.</p>
<p>That's exactly what Wildrose wants. "Vote for Ed," cries one Wildrose party strategist. "He's our best friend."</p>
<p>A shaky result for Stelmach could be dangerous, too, by kick-starting covert leadership races like those that eventually ran Klein out of office.</p>
<p>The premier's one solid ally is time. He ardently hopes his party grants him more of it.</p>

<p>There were balloon-makers, a 5 a.m. tailgate party and even Calgary's most famous toddler team--Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia, better known as the Jepp quadruplets. And the only jostling, yelling and screaming happened in front of the needle-wielding nurses and glass display of doughnuts at the nearby <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span>.</p>
<p>Similar to the one in 13 million chance of the local birth of a set of identical quadruplets two years and three months ago, on Thursday morning Calgary experienced what many by now would consider a miracle: a well-run, properly thought-out H1N1 vaccine campaign.</p>
<p>I'd apologize for the sarcasm, if it weren't for the fact that the original rollout last week was done with the kind of expertise befitting Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber; an apt comparison that would be comical if not for the fact that people are actually dying from this virus.</p>
<p>Any of the busy moms in line on Thursday morning, juggling babies, bottles and DVD players playing Dora the Explorer, could have come up with a better plan simply scribbling quick thoughts on a paper napkin in between feedings and nap time; but it's insulting to moms everywhere to state such an obvious fact.</p>
<p>The past 10 days of screw-ups and outright scandals started with a chaotic free-for-all that caused widespread panic and eight-hour lineups--ignoring the fact that for most healthy adults, there is little risk of becoming gravely ill from this new strain of influenza.</p>
<p>In a scene lifted from the annals of the Titanic, it was followed by the discovery that Alberta Health Services' "priority list" includes rich and famous athletes, and then a call from the province's ombudsman to investigate the disastrous pandemic response. But now, miracles of miracles, it appears someone just might have turned for advice to people with that rare commodity: common sense.</p>
<p>For this is what finally prevails on Thursday as moms, dads, grandparents and other caregivers arrive at the city's six vaccination clinics set up for children between the ages of six months and five years. At the two clinics I visit in the early morning hours --Avenida and the grandstand building at the Stampede Park-- I'd be hard pressed to make even one suggestion on how things can be improved upon. The parents who come in droves, not surprisingly, have geared themselves for the worst, or as Kahleia Murdoch, mom to two-year-old Cavan, says as she leaves the Stampede grounds after only a one-hour wait, "I set the bar very, very low." To find things not just tolerable, but in fact relatively easy, has many relieved to the point of giddiness.</p>
<p>"Last week we tried coming three times," says Sandra Articas, who arrived at 7 a.m. at the Avenida location with her six-month-old Omar. "It was like something out of an end-of-the-world science fiction movie. Do you know how hard it is to stand in one place all day with a baby, with no easy way to even change a diaper?" Articas, who was in and out of Avenida in less than two hours, was so happy she could hardly stop giggling. "This is wonderful, now I can get him home in time for another nap."</p>
<p>Janine Gervais could hardly believe her eyes when she arrived at Avenida at 6 a.m. to hold a spot for her sleeping four-year-old Jenna, who has asthma. "I pulled up to the parking lot, and saw a tailgate party, complete with TVs on the back of trucks and people doing runs for <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> coffee and doughnuts," says Gervais, a working mom who had planned to get her daughter vaccinated over the weekend, but lost the opportunity when the province shut down the clinics temporarily.</p>
<p>"This was just a bunch of dads, holding down the fort for their families, and they found a way to make it fun. When I saw them on their lawn chairs, I just burst out laughing."</p>
<p>At the grandstand, the many TV monitors are tuned into the kiddie Treehouse network, there's free coffee and hot chocolate, and a steady stream of parents leaving the building with the kind of smiles you usually see on those who got on stage with Kreskin.</p>
<p>"I didn't have enough time to unpack his toys," says one young mom named Sabrina. "I was in and out in under 40 minutes."</p>
<p>As she walks out into the morning sunshine, Sabrina gleefully informs those entering that it takes less than an hour. "Are you kidding me?" says one woman pushing a stroller with twins. "This is too good to be true."</p>
<p>It's all so good, in fact, that even J.P. Jepp and his wife Karen take the risk of rounding up their four identical daughters, all in what Karen calls "truly terrible twos," and bringing them out for their flu shots. "They're doing a good job," says J.P., who's helped by in-law Diane Ron, of the organizers on this day. "I can't imagine having to wait in line all day with them."</p>
<p>So while the more cynical among us might huff, "a day late and a dollar short," on this day when they finally get it right, the caregivers of our city's youngest aren't complaining. For them at least, the H1N1 lineup nightmare has turned into a dream.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stelmach to urge unity</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete And Renata D'Aliesio   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>1107 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>With his government sliding in the polls, Premier Ed Stelmach will appeal for party unity today when he speaks to Progressive Conservative supporters who hold his fate in their hands at this weekend's Tory leadership review.</p>
<p>Twenty months after Albertans handed Stelmach and his Tories an overwhelming mandate in a provincial election, about 1,500 PC delegates will determine where the party, premier and embattled government go next.</p>
<p>Stelmach will deliver one of the most important speeches of his term tonight at the party convention in Red Deer, before delegates--including current and former Tory MLAs, and representatives from riding associations--vote Saturday on whether they want a leadership contest called.</p>
<p>In Calgary on Thursday, the premier noted the economic slump may weigh on how delegates vote, but said it's a critical time for all PC members to band together to pull the party and province out of a trough.</p>
<p>"We have to work together, pull together to work through this recession," Stelmach told reporters. "It will be a speech tied to unity and remind our party membership and remind Albertans that we went into this recession (in a) better economic position than anyone in Canada and we're going to come out stronger."</p>
<p>The leadership review comes amid public discontent over government's management of the economy, fallout of the new oil and gas royalty plan, and the controversial rollout of the H1N1 flu vaccinations.</p>
<p>It also falls on the heels of a new Environics poll indicating the upstart Wildrose Alliance is challenging the Tories as the favoured party in Alberta and has overtaken the PCs in Calgary. The survey also revealed the Tories have sunk to their lowest level of popular support in 16 years.</p>
<p>"It's something I expected to take place heading into the leadership," Stelmach said about his party's sagging popularity, arguing government support often sinks between elections.</p>
<p>But with the Wildrose Alliance surging in the polls, hard-core Tories are doing some soul-searching.</p>
<p>"I'm a true-blue fiscal conservative. I don't think the present government is," said former Calgary Tory MLA Richard Magnus, a voting delegate heading to Red Deer who also holds a Wildrose Alliance membership.</p>
<p>"I'm watching what they're doing and I'm distressed."</p>
<p>Chaldeans Mensah, political scientist at Grant MacEwan University, believes Stelmach needs at least two-thirds support from delegates, otherwise the party would have a crippled leader who potentially accelerates their tumble in the polls. A strong endorsement, however, would be a vote of confidence for the party that propels it toward the next election in a stronger position, he said.</p>
<p>"The choices are stark," Mensah said about the leadership review. "The Tory party faces a very serious challenge to its hegemony right now."</p>
<p>That emerging challenge has seen some political heavyweights voice their opinions on the state of the provincial Tories.</p>
<p>Former premier Ralph Klein has predicted Stelmach will face a tough time at the leadership review and needs 70 per cent backing to hold onto the leadership. Another former premier, Peter Lougheed, believes Stelmach is doing a good job and has urged PC delegates to rally behind the leader.</p>
<p>Klein was forced to resign as Tory leader and premier in 2006 after receiving only 55.4 per cent support in a leadership review, although he enjoyed backing in the high 90s during his heydays.</p>
<p>David Taras, political analyst at the University of Calgary, describes Stelmach's review as "potentially huge, potentially crossroads, potentially decisive."</p>
<p>"There's no question that there's a lot of dissatisfaction."</p>
<p>Peter McCormick, political scientist at the University of Lethbridge, doubts the Conservatives can push Stelmach "off a cliff" right now.</p>
<p>"I think a lot of them wish he would jump," he said.</p>
<p>Stelmach, however, noted that he's repeatedly proven his naysayers wrong--including in the lead-up to the 2008 provincial election--when polls suggested trouble for the Tories, before the party captured 72 of 83 seats in the legislature.</p>
<p>"It's in the hands of the delegates. This is, you know, it's a difficult time, in a recession -- see how that reflects," the premier said. "The most important poll is election day and that will be March 2012."</p>
<p>Independent Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo MLA Guy Boutilier, who was punted by the premier from Tory caucus in the summer, said there's a widening gap between what Albertans are saying in coffee shops and the decisions being made by government.</p>
<p>"Any time this gap gets so wide, I think as a leader you have to be worried. It's time to start listening to MLAs that are freely elected by people as opposed to non-elected officials," he said.</p>
<p>Boutilier, who is still a PC member, wouldn't disclose how he will vote at the Conservative convention or whether the poll results will motivate him to join the Wildrose Alliance. He suggested Tory members are being muzzled and warned against expressing negative opinions of Stelmach.</p>
<p>But Culture Minister Lindsay Blackett, who represents Calgary-Northwest, said party members realize it's not a good time to change the leader.</p>
<p>"Look at the fact that across the world, across our country, we're all facing the same tough problems-- whether it's H1N1, whether it's the economy--and we've done a lot to position Alberta to be in a place to be able to recover from this better than most other places," Blackett said.</p>
<p>"We'd be the laughingstock of Canada if we changed any of that right now."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Iris Evans has a message to Tory members who suggest the party is finished unless it tosses the leader: "They're dead wrong."</p>
<p>Bonnyville-Cold Lake MLA Genia Leskiw said she backs Stelmach because he's a "good man." Asked why the Tories are slipping in public opinion polls, she said it could be because people don't like tough choices.</p>
<p>"I sort of equate it to running a family," Leskiw said. "When you make tough decisions your kids don't like it, but sometimes you have to do what you think is best for the province."</p>

<p>As Alberta reported four more deaths related to H1N1 on Thursday, the country's top doctor said hospitalizations and intensive-care unit admissions from the new flu strain have tripled across Canada since last week.</p>
<p>Two elderly Albertans and two middle-aged people with H1N1 influenza died this week, bringing the total number of flu-related deaths in this province to 18 since the virus first appeared in the spring.</p>
<p>Health officials -- who relaunched swine flu vaccination clinics for high-risk patients Thursday -- said one of the victims was from Calgary.</p>
<p>"Given the amount of influenza that's circulating in the community, having four deaths this week is not unexpected," said Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health with Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>CalgaryHerald.com</p>
<p>Log on for breaking news and our special section on the H1N1 flu outbreak</p>
<p>"It is tragic," said Predy. "It's unfortunate when anyone dies. Even during seasonal influenza, when we get to this level of activity, we do see deaths."</p>
<p>At least three of the victims had risk factors that predisposed them to developing serious disease from the flu.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said Canadians should be prepared to hear about more swine flu deaths as the H1N1 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the spread of the H1N1 virus picked up speed over the past week and its prevalence is nearing levels that were seen at the peak of the first wave in June, he said.</p>
<p>"We expect to hear of more illness and deaths in the coming weeks as we go further into the second wave," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>In total, 115 Canadians with H1N1 have died, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>In Alberta, Predy said about 70 people with H1N1 are in hospital intensive-care units. A total of 439 Albertans have been hospitalized with the virus since the spring.</p>
<p>The four latest deaths included one person from Calgary, one from Edmonton, one from southern Alberta and one from central Alberta.</p>
<p>In Ontario, this week's toll is believed to include a two-month-old baby from London.</p>
<p>News of the deaths comes as Alberta restarted its stalled H1N1 immunization program Thursday.</p>
<p>Last week's program was criticized for multi-hour lineups and for allowing low-risk Albertans to receive the vaccine before concerns about supply forced health officials to suspend the clinics on the weekend.</p>
<p>However, at the six clinics in Calgary on Thursday, queues were substantially shorter than last week. Those who faced longer waits were given wristbands and told to come back at a specific time.</p>
<p>"It was only 45 minutes to get a shot," said Megan Zilkey, who brought her one-year-old son to the new Stampede grandstand site.</p>
<p>"Last week was chaos. . . . They should have had some sort of plan from the beginning."</p>
<p>At the Whitehorn EMS station, Brenda Else said the wait was manageable, at less than one hour.</p>
<p>"It's a far cry better than last week," said the mother of two.</p>
<p>The clinics were restricted to children who are less than five years old as of Nov. 1. Infants must also be older than six months of age.</p>
<p>Today, as the first shipments of non-adjuvanted vaccine arrive in the province, the clinics will open to pregnant women.</p>
<p>Alberta's H1N1 vaccination program was a point of debate in the legislature again Thursday as the NDP criticized the government for opening its flu-shot clinics to all Albertans last week, instead of focusing only on high-risk people.</p>
<p>"The chaos and confusion surrounding the entire vaccination program ultimately comes down to a total failure of leadership at the highest level," said NDP Leader Brian Mason.</p>
<p>But Health Minister Ron Liepert, who has said the program has been a success, said he's not dwelling on what happened.</p>
<p>"Hindsight is great," said Liepert, speaking to reporters in Calgary. "I'm going to dwell on what it is we need to do to get those persons vaccinated with the limited supply we have now."</p>
<p>Controversy also continued to swirl Thursday around Alberta Health Services' decision to fire a mid-level manager who helped the Calgary Flames jump the queue for H1N1 flu vaccinations last week.</p>

<p>Talk about a sense of relief. NASA recently announced, with one hundred percent assurance, that there will be absolutely nothing to worry about in the year 2012. The sun won't crash into Kansas. Quetzalcoatl will remain lost and therefore set nothing afire. If it exists--and NASA is positive that it does not--planet Nibiru will not provoke the catastrophic reversal of Earth's magnetic field. All good news indeed, because if the five years that have unfurled since this magazine was born have taught us anything, it is that we have entered a new era in which total apocalypse never seems to be more than a paycheque or two away. Thus, being able to rule out cosmic cataclysm for an entire twelvemonth period, even one that's a few guaranteed-to-be-tumultuous years away, ought to be something to celebrate.</p>
<p> I sense this partly because I was the guy assigned to write the cover story in the inaugural edition of Swerve about the reprise of the guilt-free liquid lunch as the defining hallmark of Calgary, circa late-2004. Looking now at that article, the literary equivalent of jazz hands, I can see what a vastly different epoch it must have been. In it I giddily referenced cartoonishly busy restaurants, $37 lunch entrees and, to the unrestrained glee of serving staff, tables full of women who actually drank--and tipped. I now find it astonishing that I got paid to write sentences like this little beauty: "In truth there is a certain pleasure, guilty of course, to living in a city where the divine liquidity of lunch can be measured not so much in the ancient standard of martini multiples, but in the tangy, effervescent mood of its citizens."</p>
<p>(I have no idea what that means. I don't generally get drunk before sitting down at the keyboard, but obviously in this case I made an exception. It was, after all, 2004.)</p>
<p>But how times have changed one demi-decade down the bumpiest road we've travelled in our lifetime. Granted, that route hasn't been quite the post-apocalyptic nightmare of</p>
<p>Cormac McCarthy's 2006 novel, The Road-- talk about spirit of the times, it was beloved by Oprah--but it's safe to say that contemporary Calgarians are effervescing at a considerably less tingly pace than before, if not literally being forced to consume human flesh. When historians finally get the stomach to digest this era, they may well refer to these five years as the most jerked-around in human memory. To recap our royal ass-kicking courtesy of the zeitgeist: Ralph Klein tipped us $400 apiece, presumably because we were drinking buddies several times removed. (Just ponder that nostalgic oddity, if you will: cold cash from a government's "unbudgeted surplus." Go try to tell the kids that, they won't believe you.) Meanwhile, the price of oil tripled. But then it quartered. Blue-ribbon securities imploded. Then oil doubled again. With Ralphie gone, his heirs jacked up liquor taxes. For fun, they almost immediately dialed them back. GST went to six percent, then five. Then they outlawed happy hour. Charles Ponzi returned from the dead bringing a horde of fellow cash-sucking zombies. And we all narrowly escaped death from any number of novel threats, including bird flu, swine flu, C. difficile, ballroom dancing and poker.</p>
<p>The latest to yank our chains? "Experts" are suggesting that Alberta should introduce a sales tax. And really, why not? Neck-snapping change for its own sake has clearly emerged as the most sensible ongoing public policy. What's the point of getting used to anything anymore?</p>
<p>On a personal note, for those of us who toil at killing trees and keeping recycling depots busy, there have been some painful realities. This autumn, that great arbiter of slenderness, the September Vogue magazine, was down to a svelte 584 pages, well below its high-water mark--oxygenated water, undoubtedly--of 840 pages back in 2007. Meanwhile, the lesser publications for whom I once worked appear to either asymptotically approach pamphlet size, or else simply evaporate like dry ice. Bless Swerve, therefore, for the immense feat of continuing to exist.</p>
<p>But maybe it was ever thus. Old-timers will tell you, of course, that they've seen it all before and moreover, it's the price of choosing to live at boom/bust ground zero. Which begs the question, are recent setbacks categorically different from those of, say, 1981? Depends on what you lost, I suppose, and how much you managed to make and spend before that. Maybe if you neither bought nor sold nor mortgaged real estate, and somehow retain a platinum-plated pension, these five years haven't been substantively different at all.</p>
<p>As someone who was born and raised in Calgary, I always used to say that in spite of whatever economic tides conspicuously buffet the overall system, there's a sameness to one's everyday existence here which has much to do with being an urban island isolated in the middle of a vast northern frontier. But now I'm not as certain. For an increasing number of reasons, most of which originate in places far, far away, life is getting dependably weirder all the time.</p>
<p>So, while I'm not ordinarily given to formulating five-year plans, maybe at this historical juncture it might be a good idea. But let's not overcomplicate it. First, I would say, stop panicking. Panic is killing us. Freaking out is for the dance floor, not the trading floor. After that, I'd say eat more vegetables, invest locally, resurrect a savings account, stop caring about Jon and Kate, and, finally, get that weatherstripping installed. Also, drink at lunch from time to time, if only to retain midday-drinking fitness. You never know.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, make it the prime directive to spread calm and reason wherever you can. If citing the authority of NASA helps nudge that feeling along, then so be it. It doesn't matter that the space agency says it won't get astronauts to the moon by 2020, as the 2004 George W. Bush promised it would--that it somehow can't get back to a place that it reached 40 years ago equipped with less computing power than a 1972 HP-35 pocket calculator plus the belief that Tang is a vital nutrient. Nor does it matter that, in 2009, they can't even crash a rocket into the moon.</p>
<p>What matters most is that the Mayans and the crystal-mongers are wrong. Oh sure, there are bound to be some hiccups. But if we can just make it through to 2012, I'm practically certain we'll be home free.</p>
<p>And what if, you ask, the universe does go ahead and collapse upon itself ? Well, then Swerve owes you a Coke.</p>
<p>THE TAO OF BROOKER</p>
<p>Think globally, eat locally." Most of us have heard the maxim about shopping only on the perimeter of the supermarket, not the middle aisles. Reasonable advice, until you get to that dreadful pinkish factory tomato from the Imperial Valley, which begs two separate questions: Does it contain any food value whatsoever, and how does that farmer sleep nights? I have come to believe in the paramountcy of locally grown food, and I try to preserve as much of it as I can each fall. (Gem jars and cold rooms, I submit, are overdue for a society-wide comeback.)"</p>

<p>"Me, I just go around reminding people that the exclamation 'Whee!' should never have left their vocabulary... And as for the immense scenic beauty of the places skis can take us, I submit that the right day up there can refresh the spirit every bit as much as a plunge into a tropical lagoon."</p>

<p>While many Canadians who are not among the priority groups are still waiting for their chance to get the H1N1 vaccine, some have been able to get their shot early - but not without some controversy.</p>
<p>Several members of the Olympic 2010 torch-relay team received their H1N1 shots last week, ahead of pregnant women, health-care workers, children and others in high-risk groups. Hockey players for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Calgary Flames and the minor league teams in Moncton and Abbotsford, B.C. have all been jabbed.</p>
<p>The public outcry over the players' shots spurred New Brunswick's medical officer of health to chastise the minor-league Moncton Wildcats, saying the organization erred in vaccinating its team.</p>
<p>As The Globe's Michael Valpy writes, the debate over who should get priority poses plenty of ethical quandaries. Ethicists seem to agree that GlaxoSmithKline Inc.'s decision to vaccinate its staff and their families is justifiable - if they aren't healthy, who will keep the rest of us healthy?</p>
<p>Mr. valpy also writes that many see getting high-value athletes vaccinated “'makes good business sense' – likely the same maxim of U.S. financial giants Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, which got short-supply vaccine from New York City health authorities against a backdrop of outraged media reports."</p>
<p>So who deserves to get the vaccine first? Join the discussion and leave your comments below.</p>

<p>The difficult journey to a nursing home, Column, Nov. 4</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in reviewing the "process," from hospital to long-term care, Carol Goar has reinforced some of the key elements about which people are misinformed. For example, when a patient is waiting for admission to one of their chosen homes, the maximum amount that can be charged by the hospital by law is $53.07 a day, although many people with low incomes are entitled to a reduction in this fee. While we advise clients that lengthy hospital stays may not be in their best interests, patients or their decision-makers do not have to choose homes from a "short list" where there is, or will soon be, an available bed.</p>
<p>Many hospitals have such "first available bed policies," which result in the "penalties" discussed in the article. However, most of these policies are contrary to the legislation governing the placement system. Unfortunately, patients and families are often unaware of the law and their rights because most of the information comes from the hospital. To counter this problem, we have published a paper entitled "First Available Bed Policies and Discharge to a Long-Term Care Home from Hospital" which is available at www.acelaw.ca[http://www.acelaw.ca].</p>

<p>The Toronto Maple Leaf management and team have scoured away the remaining vestige of self-respect this organization had left. After the queue-jumping of Calgary Flames players for the H1N1 virus came to light, I proudly thought our once-beloved Maple Leafs had not acted in the same manner. Now I feel betrayed and baffled by the team's explanation for this.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu shots for Leafs, Raptors spark fury; Ontario launches probe as shocked minister scolds star athletes</b>
</div><div>Robert Benzie   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>872 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>MET</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The Ontario government is investigating whether players on the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Toronto Raptors jumped the queue for increasingly scarce H1N1 flu shots, says Health Minister Deb Matthews.</p>
<p>A visibly unhappy Matthews told reporters Thursday she was flabbergasted the millionaire athletes managed to get their vaccine while at-risk people, such as young children and pregnant women, are still waiting to be immunized.</p>
<p>"I don't care who you are, how rich you are, how famous you are. If you're not in the priority group, get out of the line and let the people who are in the priority groups get their vaccination," she said.</p>
<p>The minister said the province was "getting the facts" to determine who administered the vaccine to some players and staffers at the hockey and basketball clubs.</p>
<p>Most Leaf players continued to say little regarding the H1NI vaccine, but centre John Mitchell said he believes pro athletes are at a higher risk than the rest of the general public for contracting bugs.</p>
<p>"I would say so," said Mitchell. "We go from city to city and rink to rink. There's people that might be an avid fan who doesn't want to miss game even though he's feeling a little sick. They come to the rink. You never know what will happen from there. We have every bit of a chance of catching it as everybody else, maybe a little bit more."</p>
<p>Leaf coach Ron Wilson said he was not vaccinated, but now is feeling under the weather.</p>
<p>"I haven't had a shot," said Wilson. "Coaching in the NHL is a high-risk job, let alone catching the flu. I haven't felt great the last couple of days myself, but I've been taking Tamiflu and I don't feel too bad."</p>
<p>Calls to the office of Leaf doctor Noah Forman were not returned.</p>
<p>Bryan Colangelo, the Raptors president and general manager, said one member of his team has been vaccinated for H1N1. He declined to identify the player.</p>
<p>"No athletes here have jumped the line or jumped any queues," said Colangelo.</p>
<p>In Alberta, a health-care worker was fired after members of the Calgary Flames and their families received preferential treatment for the shots - and Matthews suggested heads could roll here, too.</p>
<p>"I take it extremely seriously. The priority groups absolutely must be respected both by our health-care professionals who are administering the vaccine and the people of Ontario. There are people who are a much higher risk of complications of H1N1," she said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter whether it's through a private clinic or through a doctor's office or through one of the public health unit clinics, the priority groups remain the same."</p>
<p>In Ottawa, chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said the priority list was developed according to who was at greatest risk of getting really sick or dying from H1N1, and hockey players are not in that category.</p>
<p>"We do love our hockey, but the guidelines are based on those who are at greatest risk of developing severe disease or dying," said Butler-Jones, the head of the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>"There will be vaccine available for everybody, so those at lower risk really should wait because the risk of death is higher in other groups and hockey players are at no greater risk than anyone else, unless they have underlying diabetes or another chronic condition that puts them at greater risk," he said.</p>
<p>At Queen's Park, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said it's astonishing the governing Liberals have been unable to explain "why ... millionaire professional athletes (were) able to get the vaccination."</p>
<p>Matthews told the Legislature she shared Horwath's "outrage." "This is a global pandemic we are in the midst of now. There are priority groups. Those groups need to be respected."</p>
<p>Because of the vaccine shortage, the Ontario government has identified six priority groups: health-care workers; pregnant women, children aged six months to under 5 years; adults under 65 with chronic health problems such as asthma; people living in remote communities such as First Nations reserves; and people who live with someone who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants.</p>
<p>Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Toronto's associate medical officer of health, said doctors and clinics are required to provide data to the health unit on a weekly basis showing how their allotments of the vaccine have been used.</p>
<p>"We are now in the process of looking at the data. If there are any issues, we will certainly be following up with the physicians or offices to clarify what groups need to be vaccinated," Yaffe said.</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty urged Ontario residents to respect that protocol and enable the most vulnerable to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>Leafs, Raptors get shots amid vaccine</p>
<p>shortage, Nov. 5</p>
<p>I am dumbstruck that some professional athletes have "jumped the queue" ahead of priority groups, including young children and pregnant women. Imagine the captain of the Titanic ushering panic-stricken passengers to the lifeboats with instructions to the crew: "Hockey players and basketball players first, followed by young children and pregant women."</p>
<p>We are fortunate that the current flu outbreak has not taken the severe death toll of past pandemics, such as the 1918 Spanish Flu. If that were the case, I am quite certain that the irresponsibility of government health officials would provoke rioting in the streets, or worse.</p>
<p>Joseph Verdirame, Markham</p>
<p>Why does the Star consider it a problem if Leaf and Raptor players receive H1N1 shots in advance of others? And why was a health-care worker fired for doing the same for the Calgary Flames?</p>
<p>I don't pay much attention to professional sports, but millions do. The Leafs and Raptors contribute significantly to the Toronto economy. If a flu virus circulates in a team's locker-room and, as a result, the entire team is incapacitated and cannot play, that will have an impact on many people - from businesses and workers that depend on the games to ordinary citizens who invest time and money to watch and cheer on their teams.</p>
<p>It makes economic sense to ensure that an important public resource such as a major league sports team is not taken out of action by the flu.</p>
<p>David M. Sherman, Toronto</p>
<p>News that professional athletes are getting preferential treatment in receiving the flu shot only shifts the anger away from the fact our governments are incapable of delivering goods and services in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>The frustrations that we feel today are similar to what people in Communist countries felt when they were waiting in long lines to get food. Government central planning always leads to much waste of time and resources.</p>

</p>
<p>So I'm at the gym, on the elliptical trainer, talking to my friend on the left about my H1N1 fears.</p>
<p>Later this month, I am beaching it in Jamaica and I want to be immune before I board any flying germ can. That means I have to get the shot at least 10 days before take-off - which is about how long it takes for the vaccine to take effect.</p>
<p>The last thing I want is to be hitting the buffet while, all around me, people are hacking and cacking into the jerk chicken.</p>
<p>Anyway, just as my friend says he's hoping to get immunized too, the guy on the right, a total stranger, rips off his headphones and starts raving about how the "stuff" in the vaccines is the same poison they gave U.S. troops who got "Gulf War syndrome."</p>
<p>Now, it would have been easy enough to laugh this guy off - I played the dumb, sweaty blond - except that, right after the gym, I went to the drugstore to pick up two litres of hand sanitizer, a large pack of Tylenol Flu capsules and, just in case the very worst happens, Gravol and Imodium.</p>
<p>While paying, I asked the pharmacist how his Tamiflu supplies were holding up, thinking that, just in case my doctor can't get the vaccine in time, I'll get a 'script for the antiviral drug.</p>
<p>He shook his head solemnly. Not good.</p>
<p>Throwing caution to the contaminated wind, I ask if he is getting the shot.</p>
<p>No. And you know why? Because "they" have "rushed it into production" without sufficient clinical testing. Now it's one thing for my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friends to face off over my H1N1 postings with crazy conspiracy theories about nefarious connections between Stephen Harper's government and drug giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, but it's quite another when a health professional does as well.</p>
<p>Has everybody gone mad? Do they honestly believe that the entire medical establishment is in league with Big Pharma?</p>
<p>I've had the flu once as I can recall - and I can't recall much of it since I was barely conscious for a week. It was one of the few seasons that I did not get a flu shot. Never again.</p>
<p>What's more, there's now a documented case of a cat with H1N1 - and the last thing I want is for my pets, who would take advantage of my weakness to lie on top of me, to get sick.</p>
<p>Which is why I have been relentlessly phoning my physician, who informed me weeks ago that doctors were expected to accept orders of 500, far more than they could handle, and that he hoped he'd have some vaccines in by Friday.</p>
<p>Meantime, I have spent a lot of time consulting Dr. <span class="companylink">Google</span> on this matter - even though he's a bit of a quack.</p>
<p>Much of what's circulating is just downright nuts, including a viral video with nearly a million views, of a Washington Redskins cheerleader who claims she acquired a horrible neurological disorder from a flu shot.</p>
<p>Even Bill Maher is in on this, tweeting "if u get a swine flu shot ur an idiot" to his fans.</p>
<p>Of course, solid information appears on government sites - but that hardly makes up for the screw-ups that have sent millions into near panic. Who can blame us, what with such ineptitude? Full-page ads urging us to get the shot clash with headlines telling us no shots are available.</p>
<p>As blogger BuckDog notes, "If we let Harper put the Conservative logo on EACH dose of H1N1 vaccine - there would be millions in short order."</p>
<p>It would all be very funny if it weren't so sick.</p>

<p>If you ask Lauren Gervais how she's feeling this week, the answer is: "Good. No flu." But if the H1N1 virus does knock on the door at Gervais' market research firm, Data Probe, she will be ready.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg entrepreneur has been checking the World Health Organization's website to track the progress of the flu. She's provided 150 employees with hand sanitizer, encouraged those who are high-risk to get vaccinated and told them to stay home if they aren't feeling well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, she has a work-sharing agreement with her competitors. If the flu keeps seats at her call centre empty, she can subcontract her firm's work so it still gets done and her clients remain happy.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, they will ride it out, Gervais said.</p>
<p>"Small business is the backbone of the economy so we just have to keep chugging along."</p>
<p>Across the country, businesses are quietly making plans to ensure that, in the face of the flu, the lights stay on and customers can keep coming through the door.</p>
<p>At least, that's what some are doing. Two recent surveys have found that most small businesses, in particular, are unprepared for any event that may disrupt the workflow and only a minority actively make contingency plans.</p>
<p>A June survey by <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> found that 82 per cent of Canadian small businesses did not have what business experts call a health-related continuity plan. "When you consider the potential risk to business, this low level of preparedness is disturbing," said Cathy Pin, vice-president of commercial banking.</p>
<p>A quarter of respondents said having a plan was not a priority. A poll by American Express Canada uncovered a similar sentiment: 40 per cent of respondents said a plan was a low priority.</p>
<p>"The kind of economy we've been in the last 18 months makes it difficult for them to step back and prepare for something like this," said Howard Grosfield, general manager of small business services at American Express Canada.</p>
<p>Banks, financial institutions and business groups such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have posted tool kits on their websites for small business owners who want to develop a plan.</p>
<p>At <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>., the focus is on communicating with employees, said senior communications manager Shawn Hall. It has launched a special section on its internal website giving flu updates, health information and links to government authorities.</p>
<p>"Our overall plan goes back two or three decades. We updated it for SARS and we updated it for H1N1," Hall said. "Companies that plan for any eventuality tend to survive crises. Companies that look at that as a luxury tend to fail."</p>
<p>Nearly half of Telus's 35,000 employees are equipped to work from home or another site using laptops, video and audio conferencing and a virtual private network that keeps the company's data secure. Several hundred of its call-centre employees already work from home.</p>
<p>Employees showing flu-like symptoms, even mild ones, are told to stay away from the workplace. In B.C. and Alberta, where Telus operates the 911 emergency systems, extensive cross-training ensures that properly-trained employees can cover for absent colleagues.</p>
<p>"That means those technical teams don't feel like they need to be the hero and come in and infect the rest of the team," Hall said.</p>
<p>The task of preparing for an event that may never occur can seem daunting for small business, Grosfield said. It's important to remember that each company is different and would have different priorities in an emergency.</p>
<p>"Businesses need to think about what are the top one or two things that would create the biggest issue for the kind of business we're in, and what are the top one or two things that we could do to solve that," Grosfield said.</p>
<p>For many firms, clarifying company policy would be a good start. "You'd better make sure that supervisors know what to say. They're going to be getting calls from employees asking, 'My son came home with a fever. What should I do?'" said Rod Phillips, president and chief executive of Shepell.fgi, an employee assistance plan provider.</p>
<p>Shepell.fgi handles about 4,000 calls from workers each day. "The biggest single increase in calls has been people asking about health," Phillips said.</p>
<p>Small business owners also need to determine whether they have the technology to handle a large number of employees working away from their usual workplace. Many may need to upgrade.</p>

<p>Parents should brace themselves for another round of confusion as H1N1 immunization across this province, and across Canada, moves toward vaccination of school-age children. All the troubling regional variations in the vaccine's rollout to date seem about to be repeated. And that's likely to further sap public confidence in this country's pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>There's general agreement among public health authorities that otherwise healthy schoolchildren, age 5 and over, should be first in line when flu shots are extended beyond the more vulnerable populations that are a priority now.</p>
<p>This seems right. In the United States, children under the age of 15 have five times the hospitalization rate from H1N1 of any other age group, and youngsters tend to transmit viruses picked up in the outside world to their families at home. Some jurisdictions, however, are far better prepared for immunizing school-age children than others.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan could be giving H1N1 shots, in some schools, as early as today. But British Columbia health officials have said they won't have any school clinics, thanks to difficulties in obtaining consent.</p>
<p>Ontario's situation seems especially confused, due in part to different levels of local preparedness. Peterborough's public health officials have been preparing for weeks and are ready to start immunizing 24,500 local schoolchildren as soon as Monday, if the province expands eligibility for the shot by then. Consent forms have already been distributed and a clinic is to be held in every area school over a three-week period.</p>
<p>In Toronto, by contrast, nothing much has been decided by public health officials - except that there will be no school clinics. With 1,000 schools in this city, that just won't be possible, says Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Toronto's director of communicable disease control. Under consideration are other approaches, such as class field trips to immunization clinics. That would still require parental consent forms, but Toronto isn't ready to circulate those. More direction from the province is needed and more talks with the boards, says Yaffe. Yet Peterborough was able to proceed.</p>
<p>Adding further confusion to all this, Dr. Vivek Goel, head of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, told reporters earlier this week that parents would need to accompany their children to school vaccination clinics in order to provide consent. Why? Peterborough public health officials consider a parent's written consent good enough and rightly so.</p>
<p>At this time of year, children are concentrated in schools. Immunizing them at school makes good sense. If Toronto public health officials can't manage visits to all 1,000 locations, they could at least hold clinics in those schools with the largest vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Surely our schoolchildren deserve to be given greater priority than immunizing the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>

</p>
<p>GUADALAJARA, Mexico -- Mario Vazquez Rana sits centre stage on a podium in a huge hotel ballroom.</p>
<p>This is a man clearly comfortable in the limelight as he chairs the general assembly of the Pan American Sports Organization, which represents 42 countries in the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>And why not - it's a familiar spot. He's been PASO's president for nearly 35 years and was re-elected, unchallenged, to another four-year term last year at an Acapulco meeting where Toronto officially launched its bid to host the 2015 Games.</p>
<p>He has also headed the Association of National Olympic Committees, which includes more than 200 countries, for 30 years.</p>
<p>The wealthy 77-year-old Mexican businessman runs a media empire that includes many of the country's newspapers, which have featured him prominently in their pages this week. His holdings briefly included the wire service <span class="companylink">United Press International</span> in the 1980s.</p>
<p>On Friday, he will preside over final presentations and the vote on which of three cities - Bogota, Lima or Toronto - will get the 2015 Games. The Golden Horseshoe bid, backed in Guadalajara by the likes of Premier Dalton McGuinty, is projected to come in at $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>While he's not saying which bidder should emerge victorious in the vote, Vazquez Rana is influential.</p>
<p>"He's been admired for his leadership by the delegates, who keep putting him back in as president," said Michael Chambers, Canadian Olympic Committee president and a PASO vice-president. "If there's a sense that can be determined of his leaning, then that will have an impact on the delegates.</p>
<p>"But he's a good president. He doesn't tip his hand, so to speak."</p>
<p>In his opening speech this week to delegates, Vazquez Rana spoke of his love of sport and the media: "I'm very proud that since I was a kid, I've been directed to sports, and I've dedicated my life to sport."</p>
<p>Like many in the Olympic movement, Vazquez Rana also had his time as an athlete; he competed in the 1972 Olympics in shooting. Younger brother Olegario, also in the media business, has been president of the international shooting sports federation since 1980.</p>
<p>Chris Rudge, chief executive officer of the Canadian Olympic Committee, explained that it's not unusual for leaders in the world of sports to be in place for years.</p>
<p>"This is a world built on relationships. It takes a while to establish relationships. That's why you tend to see people in their roles for a significant period of time," Rudge said.</p>
<p>Calling Vazquez Rana a strong leader, Rudge said he has contributed to building sports in the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>A member of the International Olympic Committee, Vazquez Rana was once a potential successor to Juan Antonio Samaranch but bowed out, citing age and his unwillingness to move to Switzerland.</p>
<p>He was an outspoken critic of the vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games, saying in 1999 that "our marvellous, wonderful movement ... will always be besmirched" by it.</p>
<p>This year, Vazquez Rana suffered personal tragedy in the H1N1 pandemic. The flu's emergence in Mexico last spring delayed the submission of bids because Mexico cancelled all public events.</p>
<p>It was later learned that his toddler grandson, Miguel Tejada Vazquez, was the first U.S. fatality.</p>

<p>EDMONTON and CALGARY -- For a person many consider to be one of Canada's dullest politicians, Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach has a knack for finding himself at the centre of high political dramas.</p>
<p>The latest pivots around a mandatory secret-ballot vote on his leadership at a Progressive Conservative convention in Red Deer tomorrow.</p>
<p>Few, including Mr. Stelmach, are publicly predicting the outcome, although the Premier's predecessor, Ralph Klein, has said he must be approved by at least 70 per cent of the delegates to keep his job. About 1,500 people, including all former MLAs and Alberta Tory MPs, can vote.</p>
<p>During a similar vote in 2006, PC delegates showed Mr. Klein the door after handing him an embarrassingly low 55-per-cent support.</p>
<p>Mr. Stelmach, a former farmer from northeastern Alberta, finds himself in a potentially vulnerable position only 20 months after leading the party to a surprise landslide election victory that saw the Tories capture 72 of 83 seats in the legislature. The Progressive Conservative dynasty has governed Alberta since 1971, but both the party and Mr. Stelmach have seen their popularity nosedive.</p>
<p>A poll published yesterday found 34 per cent of Alberta voters support the Tories, down from 55 per cent a year ago. Meanwhile, support for the upstart Wildrose Alliance Party, a right-wing rival to the Tories, continues to surge. It now stands at 28 per cent, ahead of the Opposition Liberals and the NDP.</p>
<p>While Mr. Stelmach shrugged off the numbers and blamed them on the recession, he acknowledged the vote comes at a “difficult time.”</p>
<p>“All I know is that this isn't the first time I've faced a situation like this,” he said.</p>
<p>Many Albertans are unhappy with the way the government has handled the once-booming province's finances and its rollout of the H1N1 vaccination program. Still, even some of Mr. Stelmach's political enemies expect the party won't punt him – yet.</p>
<p>“I would be very, very surprised if he took less than 70 per cent,” said Ernie Isley, a former Tory cabinet minister who made headlines when he denounced the party and joined the Wildrose Alliance. He won't publicly say which way he'll vote.</p>
<p>Mr. Isley said Mr. Stelmach's convention speech tonight needs to be a barnburner if he wants to convince party faithful he's still in charge. “It appears we don't know what the hell we are doing,” he said, referring to the Stelmach government.</p>
<p>Despite the problems, Mr. Stelmach has enjoyed the endorsement of former premier Peter Lougheed, as well as MLA Ted Morton and Calgary businessman Jim Dinning, former rivals for the PC leadership.</p>
<p>“I've been through this stuff before federally, and you don't refight leadership races after they are over,” Mr. Morton recently told reporters. “When they're over, they're over.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>CFL / Lions cast their lot with Printers</b>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- It's not that Casey Printers has progressed by leaps and bounds in just two weeks. It's that Wally Buono's initial premise was incorrect.</p>
<p>Printers, and not former No. 1 Buck Pierce, will start at quarterback for the B.C. Lions tonight against the Edmonton Eskimos. The winner of the showdown at B.C. Place Stadium will claim the final playoff berth in the CFL's West Division. The loser will require a Winnipeg Blue Bombers loss on Sunday to qualify for the postseason.</p>
<p>This is the first time the Lions have flirted with missing the playoffs in the Buono era, and it would mark just the second non-playoff season in the coach's illustrious 20-year sideline career.</p>
<p>That the game is in the hands of a quarterback who has played three contests in the last 53 weeks is not Buono's way, and it flies in the face of the coach's original statements about how Printers would be brought along slowly. Buono said he feared “too much, too soon” for Printers, and didn't want to cast the former CFL most outstanding player as a saviour, repeating the mistake made by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats when they signed him in September of 2007.</p>
<p>But even before injuries started thinning B.C.'s quarterback ranks and bumping Printers up the depth chart, Buono was already recognizing his errors. He said Printers's memory from his first tour with B.C. was sharper than expected, and that his attitude was splendid compared with the immaturity and selfishness he displayed in 2005, his final season in Vancouver before signing with the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>“My biggest concern was his emotional state of confidence, and that's maybe where I miscalculated,” Buono said. “He's a lot further along than I thought, and maybe I didn't give him enough credit.”</p>
<p>When the quarterback signed a practice-roster agreement with the Lions on Sept. 21 – coming back to the CFL franchise where he flourished in 2004 – Buono immediately declared that it would be best for all parties if Printers didn't have to play this year.</p>
<p>But then he began noticing how Printers interacted with his teammates, how he talked offence with the other pivots and assistant coaches, and that the scout team had vastly improved under its new leader.</p>
<p>“I misjudged his retention of what we did in years past,” Buono said. “That was something that really impressed me, and I felt that as long as he knew the signals, he would be okay.”</p>
<p>Printers, 28, has been more than okay, even though the team is 0-2 since he began starting.</p>
<p>He has passed for more than 300 yards in each of those games, and has given B.C. an explosive playmaker capable of turning broken plays into big gains. But Printers admits that he is still making mistakes on every series and that there is room for improvement.</p>
<p>That's where the new attitude is most apparent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, for example, he said he “chooses not to be rusty” despite a nearly year-long layoff. When asked how that was possible, Printers explained that he refuses to blame mistakes on rust, rather he takes personal accountability when he misreads a defence or overthrows a receiver.</p>
<p>“If you say rust or you bring it into your existence, then that's what it is,” Printers explained. “It's about the power of thought. It's my choice not to be rusty. If I miss a throw, it's because I missed it.”</p>
<p>Neither team is expected to be missing bodies tonight, though several players on both sides are going to play in weaker states than normal.</p>
<p>As many as 20 B.C. players have been sick with colds or the flu over the last week or so, including reserve offensive lineman Damane Duckett, who was quarantined in a hotel with H1N1 virus. Head trainer Bill Reichelt said that he is hoping to vaccinate six asthmatic players for the virus after the game.</p>
<p>About six Eskimos have been hit with the flu this week, including receivers Fred Stamps and Andrew Nowacki, and return specialist Tristan Jackson.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Leafs seek vaccine for sickly starts; Toronto has yet to score the first goal in a game, but Hurricanes are in even worse shape</b>
</div><div>DAVID SHOALTS AND MICHAEL GRANGE   </div>
<div>984 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>S1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Scoring first is as big a topic in the Toronto Maple Leafs' dressing room as H1N1 flu is everywhere else.</p>
<p>The latter topic, by the way, remains off-limits in the Leafs' dressing room after news leaked out that some players were vaccinated amid concern an infection could have spread to the Leafs from their farm team, the Toronto Marlies. Leafs' head coach Ron Wilson said he has not had the shot and the players remained under orders to keep quiet.</p>
<p>That left obsessing over relatively obscure statistics as the topic du jour. However, perusing NHL statistics shows there is something to scoring first, which the Leafs have not accomplished in all 13 of their games this season.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 29 teams in the league, 22 have records above .500 in games in which they score the first goal.</p>
<p>And scoring first is important tonight for the Leafs because their opponents are in an even bigger swoon than they are. The Carolina Hurricanes have not won in their last 10 games (0-7-3) and technically nosed the Leafs out of 30th and last place overall yesterday because although both teams have seven points, the Hurricanes have played one less game.</p>
<p>To snare the lofty prize of 29th-place overall, then, it stands to reason the Leafs need to score first and then play the way they have of late in the latter two periods, which is not bad at all.</p>
<p>“You want to get a jump on them early, fan that negative atmosphere they probably have in their mind,” Wilson said, adding that he speaks from experience. “It's no different than [what's happened to] us. I think that's what a team wants to do. You see a wounded animal, you jump all over it.”</p>
<p>To that end, the coaches have tried several psychological ploys to spark their players, including trying to convince them they were behind 2-0 before the opening faceoff. All to no avail, Wilson sadly conceded.</p>
<p>“We're not good enough to say, ‘Okay, we're going to score three goals in the first period,' ” Wilson said.</p>
<p>“We're in last place in the league, we're just trying to find our way here.”</p>
<p>Wilson declined to say if Jonas Gustavsson will start in goal tonight and also in tomorrow's game at home against the Detroit Red Wings. The only lineup change will see defenceman Jeff Finger replace Garnet Exelby.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fence, easygoing Raleigh is a long way from hockey-preoccupied Toronto, but the teams have a lot in common, and some differences, too.</p>
<p>While Hurricanes head coach Paul Maurice – just a season removed from his post behind the Toronto bench – acknowledges the public scrutiny is a little easier to deal with in Raleigh, internal expectations aren't.</p>
<p>The Hurricanes have won a Stanley Cup, been to a Cup final and played in an Eastern Conference final in the past eight years, so while the Leafs came into this season hoping to make the playoffs for the first time in four years, that won't cut it in Raleigh.</p>
<p>“The expectation level internally is different,” Maurice said. “Inside the Carolina Hurricane house, there is more pressure, based on the last seven, eight, nine seasons.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make the playoffs and compete for a Stanley Cup, that's an in-house philosophy. We're built to believe that.”</p>
<p>Another difference, Maurice said, is there's less risk for those involved to take the blame when things go wrong.</p>
<p>“When there's less external pressure, there's less temptation to fragment as a group, there's less pressure to protect yourself,” he said. “So if you want to know why we got off to a slow start, I think it's my responsibility. Jim Rutherford will say it's his responsibility, for whatever reason he feels that way, and every player in the room will stand up and say, ‘I haven't played the way I need to play.'</p>
<p>“You can say that here,” Maurice said. “It will hit the airwaves and it will be taken as a comment, [in Toronto] you don't have statements like that often enough because of fear.”</p>
<p>Regardless, the two teams are on parallel paths for now. Carolina has just 28 goals this year in 14 games, worst in the East, worse even than punchless Toronto, which has 31 goals in 13 games.</p>
<p>“Our record isn't indicative of how we've been playing,” Carolina captain Rod Brind'Amour said. “We just haven't found a way to get it done. If you're not scoring a lot of goals, it puts a lot of pressure on your whole game. A little mistake here or there seems to cost you the whole game, where if you're scoring goals, you can come back from mistakes.”</p>
<p>The Hurricanes were an unexpected success story last season when they made the Eastern final. But they started off slowly enough that Rutherford, the long-time general manager, fired Peter Laviolette on Dec. 3 and installed his friend Maurice for his second go-round with the club. The Hurricanes were merely 12-11-2 at that point last year, a mark that would look pretty good now given they're 2-9-3.</p>
<p>Rutherford, for the record, says he won't be firing his good friend again any time soon: “I wouldn't [change coaches] in short order. You have to understand my change last year was due to things that had happened over a two-year period where things were faltering. I'm not going to make a decision like that over 15 or 20 games.”</p>

<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>The ethics of queue-jumping: for many, it's okay; Canadians are getting edgier, but deciding who's in a priority group is a dodgy proposition to begin with</b>
</div><div>MICHAEL VALPY   </div>
<div>805 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Employees of Canada's sole manufacturer of H1N1 influenza vaccine yesterday received immunization shots along with their spouses and offspring. Was it shocking queue-jumping or gold-standard health ethics?</p>
<p>The answer is gold standard. The children and their mommies and daddies walking through the doors of Quebec's GlaxoSmithKline Inc. did so with the nod, if not the blessing, of medical ethicists.</p>
<p>Most plans for pandemic influenza preparedness place front-line health care workers and vaccine production and distribution workers at the top of the list for being inoculated. The principle is that people who care for the sick and make provisions for keeping others healthy need to be healthy themselves.</p>
<p>Immunizing children and spouses at the same time is a little dodgy, but probably defensible.</p>
<p>As the flu virus flies across the country and the vaccine roll-out still hits bumps, Canadians are getting edgier about who among their fellow citizens succeed in getting needled.</p>
<p>Ethicists such as Ross Upshur, director of the University of Toronto's Joint Centre for Bioethics, say that, if governments want the public to co-operate and accept difficult decisions, they must be transparent and open in explaining what ethical choices have been built into pandemic plans.</p>
<p>Dr. Upshur also said that, in a society where citizens generally trust each other's moral behaviour, have a collective sense of caring for one another and have confidence in their governments to deliver on their commitments, there's a low likelihood of people sneaking treatment ahead of sequencing – queue-jumping, in a word.</p>
<p>Thus, on the one hand, there's the experience of Winnipeg school teacher Kelly Fuerst.</p>
<p>At least 10 people she knows, she said, went with their children to a public clinic at the University of Manitoba and got vaccinated even though they weren't in a priority group. But when Ms. Fuerst's husband went to the clinic with their severely disabled son, he was told that, because of a vaccine shortage, caregivers of high-risk people – like their son – no longer qualified.</p>
<p>Ms. Fuerst doesn't blame her acquaintances who, as she puts it, “slid into line. That's human nature.” They were looking after their children. She blames the bad organization of health authorities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hockey players for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Calgary Flames and the minor league Abbotsford, B.C. Heat – all of them successfully jabbed but almost all outside the priority groups for immunization – cannot be said to have contributed to Canadian social cohesion.</p>
<p>Yet one ethical model designed by U.S. health economists for setting priorities for who gets vaccinated says otherwise. It's called the principle of “save those who are instrumental in making society flourish through economic productivity or by contributing to the wellbeing of others.”</p>
<p>The Calgary Herald newspaper applied the principle in an editorial on the Calgary Flames, noting first that team members play in venues where thousands of people gather, and . . . “are in close sweaty contact with the players of other teams.”</p>
<p>But getting the team and their families vaccinated, it said, also “makes good business sense” – likely the same maxim of U.S. financial giants <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, which got short-supply vaccine from New York health authorities against a backdrop of outraged media reports.</p>
<p>With reports from Rhéal Séguin, Justine Hunter, Dawn Walton and Caroline Alphonso</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Priority models</p>
<p>Who should have immunization priority when there's not enough vaccine? Medical ethicists have several models:</p>
<p>1. Save the most lives</p>
<p>Front-line health-care workers and vaccine workers get the shot first.</p>
<p>2. Women and children first</p>
<p>No one believes in that any more.</p>
<p>3. First come, first served</p>
<p>The principle followed in hospital intensive care units. Admitted patients retain beds despite the arrival of more patients who are equally sick or worse.</p>
<p>4. Save the worst-off</p>
<p>Used now in organ transplants. Could apply to those most likely to get ill, such as people in aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>5. Save those most likely to recover fully</p>
<p>Principle for giving penicillin to soldiers during the Second World War.</p>
<p>6. Save those instrumental in making society flourish</p>
<p>The Calgary Flames principle.</p>
<p>7. Life-cycle principle</p>
<p>Devised by Ezekiel Emanuel, brother of U.S. President Barack Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and special adviser for health policy to the White House Office of Management and Budget. It's basically age-determined. Dr. Emanuel would start with healthy six-month-olds and chronologically work up. At the end of the list would be people with "life-limiting morbidities or disabilities, prioritized according to expected life years."</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Canada needs two vaccine suppliers, Ottawa admits; Official says ‘there is no debate' about enlisting more than one flu-shot manufacturer in future pandemics to avoid current delivery delays</b>
</div><div>DANIEL LEBLANC AND PAUL WALDIE   </div>
<div>730 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Canada needs more than one vaccine manufacturer to deal with future flu pandemics and to avoid production delays that have affected the fight against the H1N1 virus, federal officials say.</p>
<p>“There is no debate. We all feel that when the time will come to renegotiate, we will go to tenders on a two-part contract to ensure maximum flexibility,” said a senior official who has been working directly on the file.</p>
<p>While the Harper government has applauded GlaxoSmithKline Inc. for making more than 6 million doses so far at its facility in Ste-Foy, Que., a number of officials involved in the crisis said Canada deserves a second producer in the future.</p>
<p>Had that been the case this time, one manufacturer could have worked on the production of vaccines with the adjuvant additive, while the other one could have produced non-adjuvanted vaccines for pregnant women.</p>
<p>GSK was forced to make changes to its production line in mid-course, which caused delays in the delivery of vaccines to the provinces.</p>
<p>The official said that a simple stroke of bad luck can endanger thousands of doses of vaccine, and that it's better to “be safe than sorry” when it comes to production matters.</p>
<p>The GSK contract dates back more than a decade when health officials across Canada began planning for a pandemic, and mass inoculations, in the wake of an avian flu scare.</p>
<p>At the time, officials feared a global flu outbreak would prompt countries with vaccine plants to close their borders and hoard supplies. John Spika, a senior federal health official, led an effort to secure a Canadian-based vaccine supplier, arguing in 2000 that “we feel the only vaccine we could be assured of having would be produced here in Canada.”</p>
<p>The only Canadian-based supplier was BioChem Pharma Inc. of Laval, Que., which got into the flu vaccine business in the early 1990s. The company's chief executive at the time, Claude Vézeau, saw the federal pandemic preparations as something of a godsend for the company.</p>
<p>“We were losing money manufacturing the [seasonal flu] vaccine,” Dr. Vézeau recalled yesterday. “So we went to the government and said, ‘Listen for this to be a viable manufacturer we need to increase the price of our vaccine.' ”</p>
<p>The price hike became part of the pandemic-planning negotiations and in 2001 the federal government signed a 10-year contract with the company worth around $300-million. The contract required BioChem to supply all vaccination needs in the event of a pandemic and the government agreed to buy half of its annual flu vaccine from BioChem at a higher price. The company also received some help from the government to expand the Ste. Foy plant.</p>
<p>Over the next few years the flu vaccine business became more lucrative for multinational drug giants and they began snapping up facilities. BioChem was sold several times and ended up in the hands of GSK in 2005 as part of the company's $5-billion expansion of its global vaccine business.</p>
<p>Dr. Vézeau defended the government's decision to go to a local supplier, saying the fears about closed borders were legitimate. But others tried to stop the move.</p>
<p>“We at the time argued, unsuccessfully, that while [fear of supply] might be a concern it wasn't the only concern,” said Rob Van Exan, an executive with the Canadian division of French drug maker <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis SA</span>.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Exan said flu vaccines are difficult to make, which is why many countries have more than one supplier. If one company has a problem, the other supplier can step in. The United States has five suppliers including Sanofi, which has been making H1N1 vaccines at plants in France and the United States nonstop since September.</p>
<p>While controversy over the contract continues, GSK took time out yesterday to vaccinate some employees at the plant. GSK spokeswoman Megan Spoore said yesterday that Health Canada authorized the vaccinations. Only those employees considered essential workers who work daily on vaccine production and their families were to be vaccinated, she said. .</p>

<p>Readers of the article Private Clinic Patients Jump the Line For Flu Shot (Nov. 2) may have concluded patients at the Copeman Healthcare Centre in Vancouver were able to obtain the H1N1 vaccine before others. This was absolutely not the case. Our clinic was allocated vaccine by the B.C. health authority based on our patient numbers. The limited supply we received was administered strictly according to government authorities' priority-distribution guidelines.</p>
<p>Through our computerized medical records, we were able to identify patients in high risk groups. As random requests came in, we were able to validate they were part of these groups (unlike public clinics that generally don't have this information). When people weren't high risk, they were denied. We were well organized, there were no lineups.</p>

<p>Fredericton -- As far as the vaccine rollout goes (More Than Half Of Vaccine Doses Sitting in Storage – Nov. 5), Mickey Mouse seems a fitting symbol for more than the Chief Public Health Officer's watch.</p>

<p>Toronto -- Why wouldn't private clinics secure H1N1 vaccine for their patients? Why wouldn't organizations such as the Calgary Flames inoculate their “assets”? It's the responsible thing to do, given the government's urgings.</p>
<p>Anyone feeling the H1N1 program is a mess and that someone must shoulder the blame need look no further than the government.</p>
<p>The Chief Public Health Officer says that, over all, the plan has gone remarkably well. Quite the self-assessment. It's all about expectations.</p>

<p>Toronto -- It comes as no surprise the Chief Public Health Officer was caught off guard by public response to the vaccine. His remark that “if there are tickets for Duran Duran, you're going to have a long lineup” demonstrates that David Butler-Jones doesn't exactly have his finger on the pulse of the nation (A Calm Demeanour And A Mickey Mouse Watch – Nov. 4).</p>

<p>Brantford, Ont. -- Isn't it the citizenry who have, or should have, ultimate responsibility to foster a safe and lawful environment for society's members?</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons (convenience, administrative efficiency – it sometimes happens, recent H1N1 programs notwithstanding – specialized expertise, etc.) we delegate various responsibilities to others for day-to-day operations, but constant vigilance is required to keep these bureaucracies from losing sight of the fundamental objectives and becoming focused on their own priorities. Recent experiences with police forces (problems with the RCMP in B.C. and elsewhere, the politicization of the OPP, etc.) should remind us of those dangers.</p>
<p>This is not to advocate vigilante action run amok but we should be encouraging more, not less, citizen involvement in keeping society safe. The treatment of David Chen by authorities is a disgrace.</p>

</p>
<p>AS the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper celebrates the passing by the House of Commons of a bill that would abolish the long-gun registry, it perhaps should water the wine just a bit.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have opposed the registry since it was implemented by a Liberal government amid the distress that followed the killing of 14 women at the Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal in 1989. But in government they have done little to fulfill their promise to abolish it. It took a private member's bill, put forward by Manitoba Conservative MP Candice Hoeppner, to move the issue forward.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, it moved ahead by a giant step as MPs voted to eliminate it. The use of a private member's bill to eliminate this extravagant and pointless piece of penitence was a good tactic, as it allowed Liberal and New Democrat MPs to participate in a free vote. At the end of the day, the result surprised almost everyone, with the bill passing by an unexpectedly large majority -- 164-137 -- in a packed House of Commons that included one swine-flu-infected Bloc Quebecois MP in a face mask who struggled in to support his party's defence of the registry.</p>
<p>The Bloc was unanimously opposed to the bill and has already begun trying to make political hay out of the vote, telling Quebecers that all three federal parties are soft on gun crime. There is no logic in that. Most owners of long guns -- rifles and shotguns -- are farmers, hunters and recreational shooters who pose no criminal threat. If the bill passes as it should, handguns and prohibited weapons will still have to be registered.</p>
<p>The long-gun registry cost at least $1 billion, perhaps as much as $2 billion, to establish under a Liberal government that loved it, and costs at least $1 million, perhaps as much as $2 million, a year to maintain, and that is under a Conservative government that has hardly bothered to enforce it.</p>
<p>The cost is not hard to measure. What is difficult is to find is the benefit all that money has bought Canadians. The answer would be none, or at the most optimistic, very little. Most polices forces, although, tellingly, not all of them, like it, but the police tend to be professionally obsessed with identification. What all that expense has done is to inconvenience, harass and sometimes criminalize farmers with shotguns.</p>
<p>Even the Liberal party -- along with the Bloc Quebecois the last, lorn supporter of the gun registry -- is now watering its own wine. Leader Michael Ignatieff suggested this week that the farmer who neglects to register his shotgun should not be criminally convicted, but merely punished by a pointlessly punitive fine.</p>
<p>No one should be popping champagne corks yet, however. Ms. Hoeppner's bill has a long way to go before logic is restored to this country's gun laws. It must first go to a parliamentary committee, where opposition parties can try to disarm it, then to another reading in the House of Commons and finally to Senate, which at the moment, is dominated by Liberal political appointees.</p>
<p>If common sense prevails in the committee, however, and the MPs remain true to the votes they cast on Wednesday, and the Senate realizes that this is not an issue on which it should disgrace itself once again, then it is possible that by the end of this parliamentary session, Canadians will be freed from this bit of tiny-tyranny that the gun registry represents.</p>

<p>1. We love when companies take on each other in their advertising: It's the business world's version of WWE wrestling, except the body blows aren't (as) fake. South of the border, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> has been smarting over a Verizon campaign using maps to compare the two company's 3G coverage. The ad's tag line? “There's a map for that.” <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>, which has exclusive rights to the iPhone, is now suing Verizon for false advertising. It seems to us that if <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> spent as much effort on upgrading their oft-maligned network as they do on legal tussles, this never would have happened.</p>
<p>2. Bad news: breakfast cereals apparently don't cure cancer. Under pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Kellogg is pledging to remove big, bold claims from boxes of Rice Krispies and Cocoa Krispies that the cereals help boost immunity. Parents and public health professionals said consumers could be misled into thinking the cereals could help fight H1N1. Last spring, Kellogg's had to pull ads that claimed Frosted Mini-Wheats improved the attentiveness of children by 20 per cent. Hey parents, do you know what really improves kids' health? Not feeding them sugary crap for breakfast.</p>
<p>3. Speaking of marketing gone awry: The Down Under division of <span class="companylink">Kraft Foods</span> recently hit a bad patch of yeasty brown sludge when it dared to fool with the national food Vegemite, blending it with cream cheese and holding a contest in which Aussies were able to vote on a name for the new concoction. The winner, Vegemite iSnack 2.0, wasn't a winner with the public, and the company was forced to hold another vote. The new winning name? Cheesybite. That strikes us as fairly gross. Then again, we live in a country that adores something called poutine.</p>
<p>4. Congratulations to the folks at Taxi Toronto for winning a pair of gold statuettes at the London International Awards for their work on <span class="companylink">Pfizer Canada</span>'s Viagra account. The winning ads, a trio of 16-second TV and mobile spots, each featured a 60-something fellow recounting how he and his wife had grown obsessed with a leisure activity. “Antiquing took over our lives,” says one of the men. “So I tried Viagra, and now my antiquing is pretty much gone.” The spots are wry, yet pointed, without being déclassé. If only we could say the same for every ad out there.</p>
<p>5. Buy an ad, get out of town? This week <span class="companylink">Astral Media Radio</span> announced it had paired up with Aeroplan to offer program points to clients who directly buy ads on one of Astral's 83 radio stations across the country. For its launch promotion, the companies are giving every Astral client who is registered with the program by next August a shot at winning 200,000 Aeroplan Miles. That might just be enough points to get you to some exotic location where you won't have to think about advertising, radio, or any kind of business at all. Simon Houpt</p>

<p>Heartbreaking hardly begins to describe the emotional torment surrounding the loss of a loved one to diseases such as the current H1N1.</p>
<p>Those parents in poorer corners of the world who lose children to diseases preventable with cheap and effective vaccinations invariably suffer as we in the developed world do.</p>
<p>While thousands of parents in Canada stand in lines to ensure that their toddlers receive the free H1N1 vaccine, we should take a moment to remember the millions of parents whose poverty forces them to simply stand by while their children die from easily preventable diseases.</p>
<p>Last month, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chan, made this comparison:</p>
<p>"The H1N1 pandemic draws attention to the promise and dynamism of vaccine development today. Yet it also reminds us once again of the obstacles of bringing the benefits of science to people in the poorest nations."</p>
<p>According to a recent World Health Organization report, vaccines are more readily available than ever before and the impact has been profound. Measles deaths alone fell by 74 per cent in the seven years from 2000-2007. Furthermore, the WHO reports that if all the vaccines now available against childhood diseases were widely adopted, an additional two million deaths a year could be prevented among children under five years old by 2015.</p>
<p>A great deal of work remains to be done to meet this goal. Life-saving vaccines still do not reach an astounding 24 million children who are the most at risk. To reach them, an additional $1 billion per year is required. That is why the WHO is calling on wealthy countries to sustain and increase funding for immunizations in order to build upon the progress made so far and, more importantly, to ensure that hard won gains are not lost.</p>
<p>Ajebush Wakalto is a health extension worker. With a mere 12 months of training after graduating from Grade 10, she has the skills she needs to provide basic and preventive services in a health post in her remote community in Ethiopia. Ajebush helps members of her village of Timbicho to proactively prevent disease and provides vaccines for mothers and children. One of the vaccinations the DTP3, protects children in her community against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.</p>
<p>The WHO and UNICEF estimate that Ethiopia's national DTP3 coverage is 69 per cent. In Timbicho, the vaccination coverage rate is around 80 per cent and Ajebush aims to get it up to 100.</p>
<p>One of her clients is Meseret Teshome, a mother of five, who visits Ajebush at the community health post. Meseret used to have to walk two hours to reach the nearest health centre. Now that she can meet the health extension worker regularly and her children are benefitting from increased access to basic immunizations and services, she says that her children have less diarrhea and don't cough as much.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Immunizations Initiative (CIII) is a home grown Canadian initiative that has had tremendous global impact. Through the CIII, Canada has been a leader in ensuring the provision of basic immunizations to poor children worldwide.</p>
<p>A key objective of CIII has been to help achieve the 1990 World Summit for Children challenge which called for immunizing 90 per cent of one-year-olds worldwide, eradicating polio, eliminating neonatal tetanus, and reducing measles mortality by 95 per cent. The global immunizations campaign, of which CIII has played a major part, has led to some amazing successes, like the 74 per cent drop in measles deaths referenced earlier.</p>
<p>In 2003, Canada announced a total of $80 million over five years for CIII. In 2008, this funding was renewed for one year. Now, that year is up and CIDA's support for CIII is in danger yet again of expiring.</p>
<p>Canada should not only renew its support for CIII but should increase it. The current global funding gap for immunization is about $1 billion a year, which would save an additional two million lives by 2015. Canada's fair share of this, based on the relative size of our economy, is an additional $50 million per year. Basic immunization is one of the most cost-effective and life-saving foreign aid programs in existence. It should be held up as a clear and proud example of Canadian aid at its best, especially at a time when the effectiveness of foreign aid is often questioned and the global need is so great.</p>

<p>THE doctrine of equality before the law means that everyone is to be treated the same, regardless of title, wealth or political power. It means that the penalty for a crime should be the same for every citizen, all things being roughly equal.</p>
<p>The people of Waywayseecappo First Nation, however, would be justified in wondering if there is one law for them, and another for their leaders, after the band's chief avoided a jail sentence this week for his third drunk-driving conviction. Chief Murray Clearsky received a 30-day conditional sentence, including a requirement that he remain in his home under curfew except to attend to reserve business.</p>
<p>The Criminal Code carries a minimum penalty of 30 days in jail for a second drunk-driving offence, and 120 days for a third offence. Those are the penalties applied to the vast majority of drunk drivers. The Crown, however, can exercise discretion in cases that it feels are exceptional. In the case of Chief Clearsky, both the defence and Crown told court they saw no point in sending him to jail because the community needed his leadership during the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>With respect to the learned judge, why not just postpone sentencing until the pandemic is over? Was there no one else on band council capable of managing the current crisis? Chief Clearsky is not indispensable (Rene Levesque famously said graveyards are full of indispensable people) and the court was wrong to treat him differently than others would have been under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>The chief, in fact, appears to have been treated lightly over the years by the courts. In 1983, he was fined for refusing to provide a breath sample, and again in 2004. Two years ago, he was stopped by police after he nearly crashed into another vehicle. His blood-alcohol level was twice the legal limit, a sign of gross contempt for the law. He's also been convicted for a weapon's offence.</p>
<p>By establishing minimum jail sentences for repeat offenders, Parliament has made it clear that the offence is reprehensible and not to be tolerated by the courts. It is one of the most serious offences in the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>Chief Clearsky has done the right thing by seeking help for his drinking problem and for recognizing that he failed his people. His insight into his own problems and responsibilities is commendable.The court's sentence, however, sends the wrong message, particularly for those who already mistrust the legal system. It says that there is one law for the rich and powerful, and one for those who are not.</p>

<div>H1N1 / BAD BEHAVIOUR</div>

<div id="hd"><b>Stop the swining and swanning</b>

<p>jtimson@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Call this what it is – the season of behaving swinishly.</p>
<p>Whether it's swining (whining constantly about how badly handled the Canadian H1N1 vaccination rollout has been), or swanning (skipping arrogantly in front of others to get your poke in the arm), or swooning (dramatizing any mild ailment you have as “possibly H1N1, but I don't think so”), living in the shadow of this pandemic and coping with the considerable confusion of the vaccination schedule has caused some of us to behave badly.</p>
<p>Let me count the ways.</p>
<p>The first shake of the head in disgust goes to the Toronto lawyer who, after taking his family to be vaccinated at a private clinic (he has a corporate membership) ahead of other, less privileged patients who lined up for hours at public clinics, said: “Quite frankly, I think this kind of proves socialized health care doesn't work.”</p>
<p>No, it kind of proves that corporate entitlement is alive and well.</p>
<p>Then there were the Calgary hockey players and their families who sparked outrage by jumping the queue and getting early shots. Perhaps they would now consider contributing to an unemployment fund for the health official who was fired for arranging it.</p>
<p>Apparently that is only the tip of the ice rink: Pro and amateur hockey players in quite a few cities – surely among the healthier specimens in our society – have been vaccinated early because, why exactly?</p>
<p>I wonder also whether we in the media have gone too far by hyping H1N1 news to the point where anxiety about the disease is spreading faster than the virus itself. There's something about blaring headlines that the vaccine is running short that makes you want to run madly to get it.</p>
<p>There were the celebrity naysayers who gave odd answers to the question of whether they would get the vaccine. I'm puzzled most notably by Margaret Atwood, usually sharp as a tack, who said she was undecided because “I was told (by a talk show host in New York) that as I am over 65, I may have some immunity, as my parents had the 1919 flu.” For as clear-eyed and observers as Ms. Atwood, it didn't make much sense, especially the part about believing what a talk show host told her.</p>
<p>There is widespread confusion and chaos surrounding this pandemic, some of it caused by an erratic vaccination program. You can't repeatedly tell an anxious population to go get a vaccination, then not have it available when you say you're going to, and in the doses required.</p>
<p>To say, as several health officials have, that they were “surprised” by the public's avid response (admittedly fuelled suddenly by the deaths from H1N1 of two Ontario children) is to partly admit you are shocked that anyone believed your public service announcements in the first place.</p>
<p>Even slightly objectionable H1N1 behaviour stems from a very human place of fear or worry. Like parents I know who heard privately that a Toronto community clinic would be dispensing the vaccination early. They decided not to tell more than a few other people the good news before they could hurry their two young kids to the clinic. But it turned out their children were sick with something else, and couldn't be given the vaccine anyway. They wondered if it was nature's way of paying them back.</p>
<p>People do it all the time in a catastrophe (which this isn't yet, thankfully). They push themselves – either forcefully or subversively – to the head of the line, or into the Titanic lifeboats, ahead of the truly vulnerable. They also hoard – you can bet more than a few people have stocked up on the antiviral medication Tamiflu just in case. I hope they'll share if they don't require it. Confusion about what H1N1 is, exactly, has caused people to act in an unsettling fashion. Like the friend I saw on the street who, when I casually asked how she was, told me she had a sore throat but she didn't think it was “you know.” I reared back, and she noticed it. I felt bad.</p>
<p>We will sort this all out. There will be postmortems on how the government could have improved its rollout, and how it can beef up its emergency preparedness; there will be analyses of the media's H1N1 coverage; and perhaps some individual stock-taking too.</p>
<p>Let me go first: I admit it, I've been swining – complaining about the inefficiency of the rollout. And I've even been swooning – convinced by the onset of even one symptom that I have “you know.”</p>
<p>So far I haven't swanned, and got myself a VIP vaccination. But if I thought the lives of my loved ones were truly on the line, I'm not sure what I'd do. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.</p>

<p>By rights, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff should own the H1N1 issue and the botch that the authorities have made of it, just as he should own the health-care issue overall. His party built and sustained our health-care system, which has re-emerged as the main concern of voters. A new poll this week finds a 90 per cent majority approve that “universal” system – crossing all regions and demographics. Most support is “unqualified,” and is highest – this surprised me – among the youngest group, the 18- to 29-year-olds. They haven't, on this, been swayed by the individualistic rightward shifts of recent decades, although none of them were around during the original war over medicare.</p>
<p>The opposition leader could have taken definitive possession of this affinity if he had visited the United States during the recent health-care debate there to defend our system against lies told about it, while proudly standing up for it. Instead, he wrote another book on his family and gave interviews to magazines in London and New York. Perhaps his new chief of staff, Peter Donolo, will rectify that. (Or maybe they should just eliminate the middleman by making Mr. Donolo the new leader, via a coup of the kind that installed Mr. Ignatieff.)</p>
<p>Stephen Harper cannot own this issue. It doesn't fit him. To him, our health-care system more than anything else marks Canada as what he once called “a second-tier socialistic country.” He has a second-tier minister in charge of it, and their record is spotty, not just on H1N1 but on medical isotopes, for instance. He clearly lacks “empathy,” as John Ibbitson wrote, with those living in some fear of flu. Health care just doesn't turn his crank.</p>
<p>You could see this in the verve with which Tories shifted to abolishing the long-gun registry this week. They were back in their element. What I found odd watching it unfold is that it seemed to be of a piece with their favourite political activity: getting tough on crime. Yet, it was a bill eliminating a gun-control measure; it was opposed by the police chiefs' association. Victims of gun crimes sobbed in the gallery – no matter. Was it the implication that crime is so bad that we all need guns to defend ourselves? Or is it just that Tough on Crime is the issue? They own it, and it's whatever they say it is.</p>
<p>In the National Post yesterday, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson outlined “the Tory vision: a safe Canada.” The way there, he said, is an end to “double credit” for time served before trial, stiffer terms, abolish parole, end the “revolving door,” etc. Notice that all these have no part in preventing more crime; they involve solely an increase in punishment. What a gloomy vision. “We” can do nothing but live in fear of “them”; then make them suffer for doing it to us. I don't really get why this has such voter appeal. Maybe if they actually acted effectively to diminish crime, some people might feel they had lost their precious right to a sense of grievance. Search me.</p>
<p>It will be costly and require a prison “boom” of around $4-billion. The Tories don't mind lavishing tax dollars, if they go to being tough on crime or the military. To each his own comfort zone. You say safe, I say healthy.</p>
<p>At any rate, this could shape the next election in terms of issues: flu versus crime, health care versus prisons. It's interesting how different they are, almost metaphysically. Illness is a force that affects us all, sometimes daily. Crime is a thing we rarely encounter, often never. When you experience crime, it can be hellish, but it is very unlikely statistically, compared with the odds on illness. Yet, the power of fear and projection can't be discounted. Mere “reality” has no predictable advantage over the imagination when voters are confronted with choosing between issues. It will be an interesting election, whenever it visits us.</p>

<p>LEAVING A LEGACY</p>
<p>The Royals seem set on leaving a little marker everywhere they go. In their first four days in Canada, the couple has planted two trees, laid one wreath and unveiled four permanent commemorative plaques.

<p>While in Ontario, two Lincoln Town Cars were fitted with red licence plates, each with a gold crown at the centre. They scream, metaphorically, 'Royalty on Board'. The concept is amazing to me. Do they have a new set of plates for every country they visit? Will they be used again in British Columbia, or are they held in a vault until the next time a member of the royal family comes to Toronto?

<p>A THRONE FIT FOR A PRINCE</p>
<p>Of the 27 seats prepared for special guests at last night's presentation of colours, held in the chilly, outdoor Varsity Stadium, only one was made of sturdy wood.</p>
<p>TO TOUCH A PRINCE</p>
<p>It is one thing to show up for a royal appearance, it is an entirely other thing to be selected from the masses for a one-on-one encounter. There is a definite strategy to being a royal watcher.</p>
<p>Step 1: Show up early It's not Prince Charles's fault that he shakes hands only with those lined up in the front row. It's the fault of physics. Diane Gauvin said she arrived at Hamilton's Dundurn Castle well over an hour before the Prince was expected, to secure a place in the front row. "I saw people lining up on TV and decided it was time to come down," said Kay Beddome, nestled in a row behind.</p>
<p>Step 2: Be adorable Five-year-old Ashley Laidlaw smiled shyly as she waited for the Royal couple to notice the bouquet of flowers she was carrying. Kind strangers had let her pass to the front of the crowd, where she waited in an olive green, faux fur-lined jacket. "She got to give Camilla her flowers," her mother later said. "She is ecstatic."</p>
<p>Step 3: Peacock Among the longest handshakes Prince Charles shared was with a woman wearing a Union Jack toque. The unmistakable identifier not only drew him in, it also provided an effective talking point. Those nearby later confirmed the prince had voiced his admiration for the hat,</p>
<p>A Royal T I Lt</p>
<p>Entering Niagara College Teaching Wine's visitor centre in Niagara-on-the-Lake yesterday Prince Charles reportedly walked in "gingerly," joking they had already been sampling Ontario's fine product. "We've been drinking wine already," he said. He would later sample three styles of Ontario wine: a chardonnay, a meritage and a cabernet franc icewine. It's a fine thing they travel with a driver.</p>
<p>POLITICS OF A HANDSHAKE</p>
<p>Among the most asked questions during yesterday's gatherings on the royal tour was, "Will they be shaking hands?" With H1N1 influenza fears at their peak in Ontario, it was a valid question. But Charles and Camilla opted for the traditional handshake over the haute fist bump. Charles launched in barehanded yesterday, while Camilla wore thin leather gloves while greeting fans in the cold. "I'm surprised he shook my hand," said Dee Dee Larocque. "He wasn't worried about H1N1 at all." Later, outside Hamilton's HMCS Haida, it was Liz Walker's turn to marvel: "I should have taken my gloves off when I shook his hand. I wonder if it</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 Nears Peak: Experts; Dreaded second wave 'has been fairly mild'</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>992 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is spreading rapidly across the country, causing more illness than some doctors have seen in a flu season, but the pandemic has yet to seriously burden the country's hospitals and might be close to peaking, experts and government statistics suggest.</p>
<p>For days, Canadians have heard much about tragic deaths and the panicked rush by some to get vaccinated. The big picture emerging of the novel influenza suggests the country is indeed in the grips of an extraordinary epidemic, but one that is far from crippling.</p>
<p>In fact, the feared second wave of the pandemic strain of influenza, coming at the time of year flu typically starts spreading most readily, has yet to reach the heights of the spring wave, Dr. David Butler-Jones, the government's top public-health official, said yesterday, although he warned against becoming complacent.</p>
<p>"We've actually been quite fortunate because the pandemic, though affecting large numbers of individuals, has been fairly mild," said Dr. Andrew Simor, infectious-disease specialist at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. "In fact, it's not substantially worse than you'd see with seasonal flu. That's good news."</p>
<p>Still, even accepting the most optimistic prediction of when H1N1 activity will peak, Canadians should make sure they get vaccinated when possible, most doctors advise. The virus will likely percolate at some level until at least January and could return for a third wave in spring, they say.</p>
<p>Plus, it remains unknown why a small minority of apparently healthy young Canadians become gravely ill from it, unlike seasonal flus that prove fatal chiefly for the old and sick.</p>
<p>"This is a population of people who for the most part are in their young, productive years," said Dr. John Marshall, head of the Canadian critical-care trials group, a coalition of intensive-care physicians studying the most severe H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>Immunization could also bring the epidemic to a close sooner. Without a vaccine, this wave would likely not peak and start declining until December or January, said Dr. Butler-Jones, head of the public health agency of Canada. With more and more people getting the shot and extending immunity through the population, though, the virus could play itself out more quickly, he said.</p>
<p>"Because by the end of this month close to half the population could potentially be immunized ... then the peak will be November because we've gotten ahead of it," said Dr. Butler-Jones in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>Some other experts suggested the plateau could come in days, and the wave end by December.</p>
<p>Most people have no natural immunity to the brand-new virus, helping it spread more speedily. It disproportionately affects the young but the vast majority of patients experience relatively mild illness.</p>
<p>Seasonal flu epidemics typically last six to eight weeks, starting in December or January. The second wave of H1N1 appears to have begun about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>There is no question it is on the rise now, with the number of laboratory-confirmed cases, flu-related doctor visits and localized outbreaks increasing steadily. In the week ending Oct. 24, the last for which the agency has issued a detailed report, there was a "striking" leap in overall flu activity, including 175 people sent to hospital, 39 admitted to intensive-care and nine dying. Almost 100% of flu cases tested turned out to be the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>In the last week, Dr. Butler-Jones said yesterday, the number of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths has tripled.</p>
<p>British Columbia would appear to be the country's hot spot, with 162 new hospitalizations in the week ended Nov. 2 and three new deaths.</p>
<p>"All our trajectories are just rising really, really fast," said Dr. Bill Bowie, a veteran B.C. infectious-disease specialist. "I have no recollection of ever being aware of this many</p>
<p>cases of clinically recognized disease with any previous influenza outbreak."</p>
<p>Family doctors, pediatricians and emergency departments are reporting unusual crowds of patients. Yet the second wave has not caused the kind of overwhelming burden on the health-care system some anticipated, with ICUs being forced to ration life-support machines and make tough ethical decisions on whom to treat first.</p>
<p>"I've not heard from anybody that we've not been able to cope," Dr. Bowie said.</p>
<p>Although he would like to see more attention paid to the most seriously ill H1N1 victims, Dr. Marshall noted that the system's capacity to treat patients has not been overly stretched.</p>
<p>The burden on the system has so far been "manageable," said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones said that may be largely due to antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. There was a "dramatic" reduction in the severity of cases in the spring wave once doctors started using them widely, he said. About one million antiviral doses have been drawn just from the federal stockpile in recent months, according to the public-health agency. That compares with a total through the past five years of just over 300,000 prescriptions sold in pharmacies, according to <span class="companylink">IMS Health Canada</span>, which tracks drug sales.</p>
<p>When Will It End?</p>
<p>When will the number of cases plateau, and start to decline? - Within days, with the wave ending by December: Dr. Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief officer of health; Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious-disease specialist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital. - Two-three weeks: Dr. Andrew Simor, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. - Soon, but could have a long, flat plateau if vaccine campaign successful: Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious-disease specialist at University of Alberta. - Difficult to predict, wave could go on for months: Dr. Bill Bowie, B.C.-based infectious-disease specialist.</p>

<p>Re: "Patience, calm on flu vaccine," editorial, Nov. 3.</p>
<p>The editorial nailed it in saying that B.C.'s H1N1 vaccination needs were foreseeable months ago -- that is, by the health minister, his officials and the several B.C. health authorities. As it is, citizens have been left confused and stumbling around for the information they need. Even doctors have not been well-informed. And supply added to the problem.</p>
<p>The B.C. circumstances are similar to the then-federal minister taking responsibility for Chalk River and the world isotope supply, for which Canada had major responsibility.</p>
<p>We have no evidence that in taking on his responsibility the minister made himself aware of the critical success factors in keeping the supply going and saw that these were assured.</p>
<p>The obvious management-control obligation of the minister was to have the needed backup steps in place for supply assurance in view of the known condition of the atomic reactor.</p>
<p>Apparently missing from the B.C. government's arrangements for such large-scale vaccination was project management, carried out to standards of project management that citizens are entitled to see met.</p>
<p>These standards exist. They would have included having backup for the <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> supply once the World Health Organization had given its alert, and full and fair public explanation of how the vaccinations were to work and the risks in supply and how they would be dealt with.</p>
<p>Observed government performance affecting citizens in important ways is attributable to some mix of the motivation and competence of those having responsibilities.</p>
<p>Citizens don't know the levels of these main causal factors in B.C. government operations, and need to know. Perhaps B.C.'s auditor general can shed light on this.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Forces return flu vaccine to aid civilian immunization program; 30,000 doses shipped back to authorities</b>
</div><div>Richard Watts   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>

</p>
<p>The Canadian military is shipping some of its special allotment of H1N1 vaccine back to help with civilian shortages, a spokesman said yesterday.</p>
<p>Lt.-Cmdr. Elmer Roque, Pacific regional surgeon, said the Armed Forces has its own health-care system and put in a requisition for vaccine.</p>
<p>But when recent delays in production caused shortages, the military decided to return some for distribution to civilian authorities.</p>
<p>"We are very cognizant of what is happening with supplies of H1N1 vaccine in civilian settings," said Roque.</p>
<p>Nationally, the Armed Forces requested an allotment of 105,000 doses of the vaccine. But it has already made arrangements to send back 30,000.</p>
<p>The allotment for Forces people in B.C. so far has been 5,500 doses and some of them may be returned.</p>
<p>Last week, about 1,000 of those were administered to Forces personnel, based on a priority system similar to the civilian target list: pregnant members and front-line health-care workers first.</p>
<p>Roque said it's important for Armed Forces personnel to stay illness-free to deal with emerging situations, citing last month's arrival of a ship carrying Sri Lankan refugees as an example.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, B.C. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Perry Kendall acknowledged the Armed Forces obtain their vaccine through different channels, but said if it were up to him he would redistribute it elsewhere.</p>
<p>"When vaccine is scarce, if we had the vaccine around, if I had access to it, I would probably have given it to the more vulnerable," said Kendall in his daily media briefing.</p>
<p>He said federal public-health authorities have confirmed the expected arrival of an additional 1.98 million doses of vaccine sometime late next week. The B.C. share will amount to 250,000 doses.</p>
<p>Prior to that, only 89,500 doses will be available next week because of manufacturing problems. Of those, 25,000 will be the unadjuvanted vaccine, reserved for pregnant women who want it.</p>
<p>Next week, the vaccination priority list will expand to include more health-care workers. So far, the priority list has included pregnant women, people under 65 with chronic health conditions like asthma, children aged six months to five, and those living with infants under six months.</p>
<p>By the end of this week, it's expected 800,000 doses will have been administered, accounting for about 20 per cent of the population of B.C.</p>
<p>IN OTHER H1N1 NEWS:</p>
<p>- Canadians should be prepared to hear about more swine-flu deaths in the coming weeks as the H1N1 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down, the country's top doctor warned yesterday.</p>
<p>In fact, the spread of the H1N1 virus picked up speed over the past week, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said at a news conference, and its prevalence is nearing levels that were seen at the peak of the first wave in June.</p>
<p>- The latest death toll from the Public Health Agency of Canada indicates that 115 Canadians with H1N1 have died. Health officials in Alberta announced that they had seen four more deaths in the past few days.</p>

</div><div>Jim Parker   </div>

<p>The H1N1 flu virus has officially arrived in the Ontario Hockey League.</p>
<p>Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds goalie Robin Lehner did not join the team for a road trip that started Thursday in Windsor against the Spitfires.</p>
<p>"Our team doctor has confirmed he has (the H1N1 vir-us)," Greyhounds general manager Dave Torrie said.</p>
<p>According to OHL vice-president Ted Baker, that makes Lehner, who was a second-rou-nd pick by the Ottawa Senators, the first league player to contract the virus.</p>
<p>"It's the first confirmed I've heard of," Baker said.</p>
<p>OHL players routinely receive seasonal flu shots, but vaccination for the H1N1 has been limited to those at high risk.</p>
<p>The Spitfires have not been vaccinated for either H1N1 or the standard seasonal flu as yet.</p>
<p>"We're not jumping ahead of anyone," Spitfires head coach Bob Boughner said.</p>
<p>"We're hoping that the seasonal one will be available sometime next week and we'll wait, like everyone else, for the H1N1 (vaccine)."</p>
<p>Battling the flu is a normal occurrence in the OHL each season although the Spitfires have not had to battle an outbreak as of yet.</p>
<p>Former Spitfire Ben Dubois did not play for the Owen Sound Attack Wednesday because of the flu, but it is not believed to be the H1N1.</p>
<p>The OHL has taken extra st-eps this season to educate all teams on the risks presented by H1N1.</p>
<p>"From a league standpoint, we're giving more direction and educational resource material than ever before given this is a more serious strain," Baker said.</p>
<p>The league is not trying to downplay the situation and realizes this is an unusual strain that has already forced Moncton to cancel a game in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey Lea-gue when several players contracted the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"Something is different," Baker said. "We've never had a team have to cancel a game."</p>
<p>Hand sanitizers can be found almost everywhere in offices and the dressing room and teams are using individual water bottles and not sharing food.</p>
<p>"We've asked teams to file what they're doing within their organization," Baker said.</p>
<p>"We summarize it and send out the best precaution.</p>
<p>"If anyone has flu symptoms, they should not come to the rink."</p>
<p>It's a topic that will get more and more attention in the coming weeks with the virus still spreading.</p>
<p>"Everyone's going a little crazy," said former Spitfire forward Richard Greenop, who is now with the American Hockey League's Toronto Marlies.</p>
<p>Greenop missed five days last week with the flu and a couple of other Marlies were suspected of having the H1N1 virus, but it was not confirmed.</p>
<p>"I wasn't throwing up, but I had bad headaches and my eyes were sensitive to light," said Greenop, who said he hasn't had a shot for seasonal flu or H1N1.</p>
<p>"You just try to be more aware and use precautions, but you don't want to panic."</p>

<p>According to Monday's paper, the Liberals would like us to think they are doing OK. Do you call losing $1 billion to eHealth doing OK? Are there more losses to come? Is anyone going to jail over this money, or will the Liberals recover any of it?</p>
<p>Or, can the people responsible for this missing money resign and receive a big fat severance cheque? Did they have taxpayers at their convention this past weekend? Maybe they meant when they are doing fine, they all had their H1N1 flu shots.</p>

<p>Parenting is hard enough but when you consider the latest immunization blitz, media coverage, and fear-inducing statistics that have been the topic on everyone's mind, parenting just seems a little bit harder these days. I've never seen more parents more scared, and not sure of themselves and their decisions, than in the last few weeks since the immunization for H1N1 came out. Can you blame us? Who knew we were all such avid gamblers?</p>
<p>Parents are being told by the powers that be that not getting their children vaccinated is like playing Russian Roulette with their health. Great, just what any parent wants to hear. Within 24 hours they receive a letter from their trusted naturopathic doctor that getting the vaccine is too big a gamble and the ramifications may not be seen until months down the road. What? No one wants to play games with their children's health, and no one wants their child to be the unfortunate recipient of a bad decision.</p>
<p>Why can't we all work together? Let's support one another in whatever steps we take to protect our children, not as gamblers throwing our precious "investments" to the wind, but as parents doing the very best that we can.</p>

<p>My spouse is less than 65 years old, has lesser heart problems, but was vaccinated. Both of us lived through both of the flu pandemics they use as an excuse to stop older people with health problems from receiving the vaccine.

<p>I cannot believe the nerve of people. Once again, we are in the flu season but of a different kind this year. With all the hype about this swine flu, I cannot believe people are still so bold and ignorant. Not only were they out and about, you know who you are, the people with the flu-like symptoms, but you were also giving out candy to the kids who came to your door. Have you any sense at all?</p>
<p>Hacking all over your house and all over the candy and then handing it out to excited children, not knowing what you may have passed along inside their treat bags. You should have turned off your lights to nurse yourselves back to health.</p>
<p>I came across some people who have been home from work with the fever and feeling sick, yet they still went out to Halloween parties and dragged their kids all over town being sick and exposing all of us who are still healthy -- and hope to be. I am disappointed and outraged. It's all over TV, and the newspapers, to stay home.</p>

<p>Steve Bernier has been flattened by the flu, but Kevin Bieksa isn't concerned that his teammate may have contracted the H1N1 virus, even though David Krejci of the Boston Bruins is the latest to be diagnosed and four others NHL players have had it, too.</p>
<p>"I'm not too worried about it," said the Vancouver Canucks defenceman, who replaced Bernier on a line with Henrik Sedin and Alex Burrows against the Minnesota Wild on Thursday.</p>
<p>"From what I read, you don't have any more of a risk than catching the normal flu.</p>
<p>"To me, it's something that's been overdone by the media. You wash your hands and cough in your sleeve.</p>
<p>"I sat beside Bernie on the whole flight here and we were kind of suspecting he was a bit sick, so we had the hand-sanitizer there and we just kept doing that every five or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>"We are susceptible because the more tired you get ... the weaker your immune system gets.</p>

<p>SHANGHAI -- So much for that notion that American golfers don't travel well.</p>
<p>The first World Golf Championship in Asia opened Thursday to a leaderboard filled with Stars & Stripes, led by wide-eyed Nick Watney and his</p>
<p>8-under 64 that tied the course record at the <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> Champions. Tiger Woods had an opening-round 67.</p>
<p>Watney got more excitement than he expected when he went to Shanghai's metropolis in a cab that weaved through six lanes of cars on a three-lane highway. He felt far more safe at Sheshan International Golf Club, where he kept it down the middle and close to the flag. Watney made an accidental eagle and ran off four straight birdies while building a two-shot lead.</p>
<p>"It was just one of those days where everything was feeling really good, so I wasn't too jumpy," Watney said.</p>

<p>Oops, we've fumbled the ball and reported the wrong venue.</p>
<p>The annual Archbishops' Trophy high school football game between the Vancouver College Fighting Irish and the Notre Dame Jugglers will be played today at Vancouver College (2 p.m.).</p>
<p>A win by the Irish will give them the Western Conference Triple A regular-season title and a first-round playoff bye. Notre Dame's Stephen Spagnuolo needs to rush for 409 yards to become B.C.'s all-time single-season record holder.</p>

<p>LESNAR FIGHTING MONO</p>
<p>Already rescheduled once, the UFC heavyweight title match between Brock Lesnar and Shane Carwin is on hold again as Lesnar recovers from mono.</p>
<p>UFC president Dana White confirmed the diagnosis on Wednesday, ending rumours that Lesnar was suffering from the H1N1 flu. White told <span class="companylink">Yahoo! </span>Sports that Lesnar can't train for at least a month, putting the Jan. 2 match at UFC 108 out of the question.</p>
<p>The two were originally scheduled to meet Nov. 21 at UFC 106, but Lesnar pulled out of that date because he had been unable to train for weeks.</p>

</p>
<p>Pandemic H1N1 influenza is now in virtually every country in the world, and health officials are bracing for an upsurge in cases as winter sets in, World Health Organization officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>"At WHO, we remain concerned about the pattern we are seeing, particularly because a sizable number of people do develop serious complications and death," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a special adviser to the WHO director-general on pandemic influenza, said at a news conference. "We anticipate seeing continued or increased activity during the winter period in the Northern Hemisphere. This also means we expect to see continued reports of serious cases and deaths."</p>
<p>The most recent figures available show that at least 5,700 people worldwide have died from swine flu, with 4,175 of those in the Americas.</p>
<p>Fukuda said that vaccinations against swine flu have started in 20 countries and that millions of doses have been delivered safely with no adverse effects.</p>
<p>He complained, however, that the agency had yet to receive most of the 200 million doses of vaccine that were to be donated by 11 countries. Delays in production of the vaccine have led to shortages, and most countries, like the U.S. and Canada, have chosen to vaccinate their high-priority groups before making good on their pledges.</p>
<p>The virus is not known to have mutated, including in people infected in a large outbreak in Ukraine, meaning that the current pandemic vaccines are expected to provide "good protection," WHO said.</p>
<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that as of Wednesday, some 500,000 cases of acute respiratory illness and 86 related deaths had been reported in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Most people recover without specialized medical care for symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat, but pregnant women and people with underlying chronic conditions like asthma are at higher risk of potentially fatal complications.</p>
<p>In an effort to ease the burden on its health-care system, Norway has decided to allow sale of Tamiflu without prescription. Some health officials have feared that such sales would lead to indiscriminate use of the drug, increasing the risk of the virus developing resistance to what is currently the most valuable tool to fight infection.</p>

<p>How about a couple of majors and maybe a misconduct for the media over its coverage of the Calgary Flames' flu vaccinations.</p>
<p>This whole swine flu scare has been perpetuated by you and I'm tired of hearing about it.</p>
<p>So, some hockey team got a vaccine ahead of others. Hooray for them! How much will The Province pay to someone who sues because they contracted the flu at a hockey game, knowing the vaccine was available to players and they didn't take it in the interests of being politically correct?</p>
<p>This may be a nasty flu virus but how much time do you devote to those who die every year from flu and other respiratory illness?</p>
<p>Quit hyping this one out of all proportion, you're a major part of the problem, rather than part of the solution. You have a responsibility to your readers so start working with people to stay healthy rather than terrify them with confrontational and antagonistic journalism.</p>

<p>Players of the Calgary Flames have jumped the queue and been vaccinated against H1N1 ahead of pregnant women and small children and other members of the public deemed at high risk.</p>
<p>Not only did the Flames jump the queue, but so did its farm team the Abbotsford Heat.</p>
<p>A coincidence? Hah! More a deliberate attempt to get a leg up on the competition.</p>
<p>Once the H1N1 really gets rolling and millions come down with the flu, including many NHL players, the Flames will have a distinct advantage. For a member of team management of the Heat to declare players should be declared high risk would be laughable if it weren't almost criminal.</p>
<p>It is disgusting for players like Jerome Iginla to plead ignorance to the fact they were taking the vaccine away from members of the public who are at high risk, including small children.</p>
<p>More heads should roll than the one scapegoat in Alberta.</p>

</p>
<p>Somewhere on Earth there are people, outwardly sane people -- stuck-in-the-1980s people, perhaps, or Don Matthews fans -- who will mist up a little, maybe even dab a few tears away, when they collapse the big marshmallow sky of BC Place Stadium for the last time.</p>
<p>For the B.C. Lions, tonight is it.</p>
<p>What amounts to the only home playoff game the Leos will have this season -- because when the real post-season starts, they will be on the road at best, and on the outside looking in at worst -- marks the last time they will play under the dome, before it comes down following the 2010 Olympics.</p>
<p>After the regular-season finale against the also 8-9 Edmonton Eskimos, which guarantees the winner a playoff spot and the loser an anxious 24 hours before its fate is determined, the Lions will be gone from their home of the past 27 seasons. They'll play 2010 al fresco, in a temporary, pre-fab facility on the former site of Empire Stadium, and when they return in 2011, the air-supported ceiling will be gone -- replaced by a retractable curtain that will let in the sun or shut out the rain, but will never again be the immutable, depressing Roof That Time Forgot.</p>
<p>And you have to admit, that's a good thing, whether you are from the Save The Dome crowd that was in favour of replacing the roof . . . or from the Blow It Up faction that thought there was nothing wrong with BC Place that a little dynamite couldn't fix . . . or whether you wondered why the Lions and Vancouver Whitecaps couldn't have put their heads together on Option C, considering that the soccer team's sugar daddy, Greg Kerfoot, was willing to put his own money into a new stadium, until he ran into the all-powerful Gastown hemp-shop/souvenir-store/panhandlers' lobby . . .</p>
<p>Whatever your slant on the issue, the end of the dome, and the crappy playing surfaces that have camped beneath it, are reasons to celebrate, not mourn. When BC Place reopens in 2011, it will be with a one-piece FieldTurf playing surface that will remain in place and be covered over for conventions and concerts.</p>
<p>Lions coach-GM Wally Buono was leery of waxing sentimental on the eve of such an important game, and even disputes the home-dome advantage the Lions have enjoyed for 27 seasons. But it's been a considerable edge for the home team.</p>
<p>"I can remember coming here in the '80s, and it was like hell on wheels," Buono admitted. "It was hot, it was tough, it was loud. And they had great teams. It was a very hostile place."</p>
<p>The lighting under the dome always was kind of sketchy, and even now takes some getting used to, said Eskimos quarterback Ricky Ray. And the footing -- on that second-hand Olympic Stadium carpet made of checkerboard squares with a thousand seams -- presents problems of its own.</p>
<p>And yet, it was a semi-fabulous spectacle when it was brand-new -- notwithstanding the bilious olive-green carpet that someone obviously thought looked better than a colour resembling, say, grass.</p>
<p>"It was a prosperous time for the CFL in 1983, and when you come in here as a rookie, you look up at that dome and think: 'Wow. This is the big time,'" said Eskimos head coach Richie Hall, who in 1983 was a rookie defensive back in Calgary.</p>
<p>"I was part of the first football game ever in this building. It was pre-season, the first game I ever started, and Mervyn Fernandez was the (Lions') big guy, and just in the first quarter alone I gave up a 50-yard bomb for a touchdown and had a pass interference penalty. So I couldn't wait for halftime. I called my mother from the airport after the game and said, 'Mom, I think I'll be coming home very soon.' "</p>
<p>But he's still here.</p>
<p>For better or worse, the $550 million to $600 million it will take to replace the roof is in the budget.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't agree with it -- there are things that money could be better spent on to solidify other aspects of our society," said the socially conscious Jimenez.</p>
<p>A new roof won't fix traffic, relieve homelessness, or fight swine flu.</p>
<p>It will just keep the rain off, and let the sunshine in on nice days.</p>
<p>But it will be white. Or at least start out that way.</p>

<p>Those folks who are outraged that members of the Calgary Flames got their H1N1 shots last Friday should chill out -- to the temperature of the ice the Flames skate on.</p>
<p>And shame on Alberta Health Services for scapegoating and firing a senior staffer who was involved in making the decision that vaccinations should be provided for the team and their families.</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with making the vaccinations available to the team.</p>
<p>One of the most enigmatic aspects of the H1N1 virus is the way it has been singling out younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, the demographic of the Flames players.</p>
<p>The team is at greater risk of contracting the virus because they play in a venue where thousands of people gather, and where they are swarmed by dozens of fans, including children. They travel to other cities, are in close sweaty contact with the players of other teams, and when they are at home, they make dozens of public appearances, including visiting sick children in the hospital.</p>
<p>Opportunities not only to contract the virus, but to spread it to hundreds of other people, are rife.</p>
<p>Apart from the public health aspect, it makes good business sense to ensure the team is healthy.</p>
<p>As for those who believe the Flames should have gone to stand in line with everyone else, it's worth remembering that these gentlemen cannot go out in public without being mobbed by fans, particularly adoring children.</p>
<p>Vaccinating them separately was the most orderly, efficient way to do it -- and the comparatively few doses of vaccine expended on the players and their families did not contribute to the shortage. The arguments of those who are irate about the Flames' flu shots rest on very thin ice indeed.</p>

<p>John Gormley's rant on the subject of H1N1 vaccination, Sask.'s vaccination protocol a pain (SP, Oct. 30), needs comment in order to correct the effect of his implied advice.</p>
<p>He objects to the unrolling of the campaign by the Saskatoon Health Region because it is orderly and planned. He apparently prefers the "anyone can come first" approach used in Alberta and Ontario, that has resulted in crowded, overwhelmed clinics with no vaccine.</p>
<p>This is even more important now that the suppliers cannot deliver the promised amounts of vaccine.</p>
<p>The planned organization in Saskatchewan that Gormley deplores is the very reason that the health region in Estevan has responded so well to the current outbreak and the reason Saskatchewan has not been in the position of some eastern provinces in which ambulances ran from pillar to post in previous epidemics to find beds for acutely ill patients.</p>
<p>Gormley's paranoia over government and planning has turned him into an anarchist.</p>

<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and public heath czar Dr. David Butler-Jones must never have become acquainted with the term, "risk management."</p>
<p>It's hard to be certain who is more culpable for the decision to use a sole manufacturer of H1N1 vaccine, but the effects of such folly are unmistakable. With only small glitches in manufacturing or logistic systems, available vaccine can be cut by 70 per cent or more.</p>
<p>Thankfully there has not yet been any catastrophic production problems, such as a fire or flood at the manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>Canada's public health message has flip-flopped from one of pleading with the public to get vaccinated early, to closing clinics and advising those in endless queues to keep washing their hands.</p>
<p>We are now told there possibly will be enough of the vaccine for piggy-flu shots by Christmas. This hollow assurance offers scant comfort to the many Canadians who will get the flu and a luckless few who will die before their holiday presents are unwrapped, because Canada's H1N1 response has been too little too late.</p>
<p>Proper risk management is based the maxim "if something can go wrong, it probably will." Multiple contingency systems and planning for the unexpected are the orders of the day. Nothing critical is ever trusted to any single source.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to ensure that our politicians and senior mandarins learn how their ineptitude affects us all is to make sure that they are in the last group to get the vaccine.</p>

</p>
<p>Tightening purse strings means Fraser Health will see another round of sweeping cuts.</p>
<p>In an attempt to balance the budget, Fraser Health CEO Nigel Murray announced Thursday the region will scale back some services to rein in a $10-million deficit.</p>
<p>The changes include reductions and closures involving acute care, hospice care, spiritual care and addiction and mental-health services.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally, these are the exact service cuts they said they wouldn't cut before the election," said NDP health critic Adrian Dix. "They are going to profoundly impact the level of care in Fraser Health."</p>
<p>Abbotsford Regional Hospital will close the doors on its six-bed adolescent psychiatry unit, sending its patients to Surrey Memorial.</p>
<p>Chilliwack General Hospital's 10-bed withdrawal unit will be axed, with addicts sent to Creekside withdrawal unit in Surrey instead.</p>
<p>The amalgamation will also see more focus put on home detox services, according to Murray.</p>
<p>"We'll be making sure that those already in the program will have good transition strategies for them," Murray said.</p>
<p>A 25-bed convalescent care unit at New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre, which officials say is no longer needed, will be closed. An eight-bed hospice at the centre will also close in advance of a 10-bed unit opening in Delta.</p>
<p>The cuts will also see 5.5 full-time health unit aides (HUAs), who assist in mass immunization clinics, laid off to save $250,000 annually.</p>
<p>Murray said the change will not impact H1N1 immunization programs as HUAs can't immunize patients and licensed practical nurses, who can, will be taking their place.</p>
<p>Other cutbacks include:</p>
<p>- Funding for 11 residential-care beds at Bear Creek Lodge, and another 11 at Newton Regency in Surrey.</p>
<p>- Eliminating funding for the Matrix Youth Addictions Program in Maple Ridge/Pitt Meadows.</p>
<p>- Temporary closures of some ambulatory care outpatient clinics until March 31.</p>

</p>
<p>Emotions conjured up by politics are as particular as each of us. For me, there's humour, amusement, frustration and sometimes even anger. And I'm inspired when someone bravely does the right thing for the right reason and gets rewarded.</p>
<p>But the one emotion usually missing is sadness. Politics just doesn't make me sad -- until now.</p>
<p>Watching question period in the Saskatchewan legislature -- secure in the knowledge that I'm in the company of only about 16 other nerds outside the political world -- is just so sad. At the best of times behaviour in question period is often like a cheap bar on payday.</p>
<p>During some legislative debates there is mutual respect and a good natured back and forth. But question period is a virtual gong show -- always has been. From shouting and braying at one another, to rude, disrespectful and abusive language, every MLA in the place should be embarrassed to be part of this tainted spectacle which is supposed to represent our democracy at work.</p>
<p>Much of the sadness is reserved for Premier Brad Wall, the guy who has brought a fresh new approach to Saskatchewan politics, hasn't made any gaffes and has public approval ratings through the roof.</p>
<p>As the nastiness level rose this week in the legislature, it's clear NDP Leader Dwain Lingenfelter is back -- the same guy whose cheap shots in the 1980s and pledge to "make this province ungovernable" featured some epic ugliness in question periods past. And it was reminiscent this week of Lingenfelter 1.0 when NDP MLAs stormed out of the house to "boycott" debate.</p>
<p>Wall could change this. Or at least try. It would take a complete shift of perspective, but if anyone could pull it off, it would be Wall. Besides the lofty objective of a return to civility -- or at least adult behaviour -- there is political strategy involved. Like in martial arts, in politics an opponent's momentum can be used against him either by yielding no resistance or deflecting energy.</p>
<p>Like force meeting force in martial arts, which tires out everyone, in the case of question period, it's jibes responding to yelling, insults meeting insults until the entire place reeks.</p>
<p>It would be paradigm bending for the premier and his cabinet to coolly provide answers during question period -- playing to the cameras and the folks back home (the few watching) -- while diplomatically, carefully and respectfully handling the questions as the opposition squeals like hyenas on the other side.</p>
<p>Within a few days -- and infinite patience, tact and aplomb would be required -- it would drive the Opposition crazy. The only people more upset than the NDP would be many of Wall's own SaskParty MLAs who, like noisy monkeys in a zoo, get so ramped up that before you know it, no one's sure who started the squalling, screaming and poop throwing, but they're all doing it.</p>
<p>If for just two weeks Wall -- muzzle firmly on many of his own MLAs -- could pretend they were in a civilized public meeting, waiting out the angry and noisy hecklers and earnestly answering, unaccompanied by applause, desk thumping, heckling or noise, it would have the remarkable effect of leaving the Opposition sounding like one hand clapping.</p>
<p>Even trying this would be preferable to the joke that has become question period. And it wouldn't be quite so sad.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>As the nationwide H1N1 flu vaccination campaign continues, people seem calm and working through the challenges of vaccine shortages and, as infection patterns vary, an expanded at-risk group, the kindergarten to Grade 6 kids.</p>
<p>As I suggested before the vaccine supply shortage happened, if the goal is to have as many people vaccinated as possible, it makes sense once vaccine numbers are back up to widely distribute the vaccine across the spectrum of schools, drug stores, doctors' offices and private nursing organizations to assure maximum penetration.</p>
<p>Now that this is being proposed, the usual ideological suspects warn even if private providers get the vaccine at the same time as the mass vaccinations, this would be queue jumping because private lineups might be shorter than the large public clinic lineups.</p>
<p>Maybe one day it will occur to the medi-scare crowd that if enough service and products are made available, the length of lines and who's in them -- not to mention whose lineup it is -- won't be the measuring stick of Saskatchewan health care.</p>

<p>Kindergarten to Grade 6 students attending community schools in Saskatoon and select schools in rural communities will be lining up for the H1N1 vaccine next week.</p>
<p>"It's a hard decision to make when you have to decide which schools go first because we only have so many human resources and we only have so much vaccine," said Karen Grauer, the Saskatoon Health Region's manager of disease control.</p>
<p>The first students to be immunized against the H1N1 virus were those living in Saskatoon's core neighbourhoods. But students living in areas with community schools are also considered to be at-risk.</p>
<p>"We have other community-school designated schools that may not have high aboriginal populations, but they definitely are linked with other health determinants that make them more vulnerable," said Grauer.</p>
<p>Teams of nurses will fan out to nine community schools on Monday and another nine community schools or schools close to community schools on Tuesday. More nurses will set up clinics in Clavet, Asquith and Humboldt on Monday and Colonsay, Allan, Delisle and Rosthern on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, consent forms and information packets were sent home with students who attend the schools where clinics will be held next week. Parents are asked to check their children's backpacks to ensure the consent forms are signed and returned to the schools as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"In schools where we have an expectation that that might happen, there are phoning trees being organized," said Bev Hanson, director of education for Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools.</p>
<p>"In some schools that are being identified, some of the families don't have phones. So there has been and will continue to be some home visits."</p>
<p>Administrators at Prairie Spirit school division, which encompasses schools in the Rosthern area, are trying to decide whether the division will provide transportation to students in five communities who will be vaccinated at the Rosthern clinic.</p>
<p>"The advantage would be providing a service to our students in giving them access to the clinics," said Ed Brockman, co-ordinator in charge of H1N1 planning for the division.</p>
<p>"But these are younger students. Is it practical to bus them to a clinic and bus them back? Or is it better for the parents to take the children?"</p>
<p>Those are questions that will be answered "soon," said Brockman, in an interview Thursday evening.</p>
<p>While kindergarten to Grade 8 students attending the six Saskatoon core neighbourhood schools are being vaccinated, only those students to Grade 6 in community and other schools will receive the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Before next week's school campaign begins, public health officials are preparing for a busy Saturday.</p>
<p>All children in kindergarten to Grade 6 who have underlying medical conditions will have access to the H1N1 vaccine at Prairieland Park in Saskatoon from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Parents living in rural areas will be allowed to bring their children to the city for this clinic. These children usually are vaccinated for the seasonal influenza, said Dr. Ross Findlater, deputy medical health officer for Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>Grauer emphasized schoolchildren must have a medical condition to be vaccinated for the H1N1 virus on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We don't ask parents for proof if a child has asthma or a heart condition. We use the honour system. We're asking parents to be respectful of the way in which we've tried to queue kids in," she said.</p>
<p>Parents will be asked which medical condition their child has and that information will be recorded.</p>
<p>About 25,000 kindergarten to Grade 6 students live within the Saskatoon Health Region. Once more vaccine becomes available, Grauer estimates it will take about 10 days to vaccinate all elementary schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Women who are in the first half of their pregnancies will have access to the unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine starting today. A 2,000-dose shipment of the vaccine arrived in the Saskatoon Health Region on Thursday. Nurses at Prairieland will be able to administer either the adjuvanted or the unadjuvanted vaccine to pregnant women. The unadjuvanted vaccine is recommended for those who are in the first 20 weeks of their pregnancy.</p>
<p>The vaccination clinic at Prairieland Park will be open today and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. It will be closed Sunday and Remembrance Day. On Monday and Tuesday, the hours will be reduced to 1 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Children from six months up to, but not including, five years, pregnant women and women who gave birth within the past four weeks can still be vaccinated at Prairieland. Immunization clinics for these at-risk groups will continue to operate in Saskatoon's core neighbourhoods and in rural communities as well. The location and times for those clinics are listed on the Saskatoon Health Region's flu website: www.4flu.ca[http://www.4flu.ca].</p>
<p>lhaight@sp.canwest.com</p>
<p>GOV'T IDENTIFIES NEXT GROUP UP</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan government has identified the next group to queue up for the H1N1 vaccine will include people under 35 years old who have underlying health problems.</p>
<p>"A more explicit definition of underlying health problems and immune-compromised will be communicated in the coming days," said Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer Dr. Moira McKinnon.</p>
<p>The date when vaccinations for this latest group will start hasn't been decided.</p>
<p>Saskatoon Health Region's deputy medical health officer, Dr. Ross Findlater, says it will be several weeks before the healthy general population has access to the vaccine.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pats doing their best to battle flu</b>
</div><div>Greg Harder   </div>

</p>
<p>The Regina Pats are treating the recent flu outbreak as they would any other insect that invades the dressing room.</p>
<p>They're squashing it like a bug.</p>
<p>The H1N1 threat aside, the Pats -- like numerous sports team across the country -- have been besieged by the annual cold and flu season. So far, roughly seven players have displayed recent flu-like symptoms, resulting in them being temporarily quarantined from the rest of the team. Only a fraction of those players became ill over an extended period and all of them are now recovered -- Graham Hood and Myles Bell being the latest -- but the team continues to be on high alert.</p>
<p>"Any signs of sickness we have to send guys home because we have that huge road trip coming up and we have some quality games at home before we leave," offered defenceman Colten Teubert. "It's really important for our team to be healthy at this time of the year."</p>
<p>Hood and Bell missed the past two games while Killian Hutt previously had the longest absence (four games). Others like Jordan Eberle and Brett Leffler, at different times, had short-term bouts but were able to play through it. Eberle, for example, wasn't 100 per cent on Wednesday, but still managed a goal and two assists in a 7-4 win over the Medicine Hat Tigers.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Tigers were beneficiaries of the flu outbreak on Saturday when they posted an 11-2 blowout win over the Seattle Thunderbirds, who were missing five regulars and had four others playing ill.</p>
<p>With warning signs all around, the Pats are under strict orders from athletic therapist Greg Mayer to take simple precautions like washing their hands regularly, getting lots of rest, drinking plenty of water and coughing into their elbows. They've also received their annual flu shots earlier than usual and ceased sharing towels and water bottles.</p>
<p>Despite those measures, a few players have still become ill.</p>
<p>"We are very susceptible," noted Teubert. "There's (24) of us, we're on the bus, breathing the same air. But as long as we keep doing the right things I think we'll stay healthy."</p>
<p>Although the Pats have done their homework, they realize there's only so much that can be done. Head coach Curtis Hunt admits he shows up at the office each day and wonders who might be next, but so far it has been limited to one or two players at a time rather than a full-scale epidemic.</p>
<p>"You can't control it so we don't spend a lot of time worrying about it," said Hunt. "We wait every day to see what Greg tells us. Is everyone here? Did you get any calls this morning or early in the night? We make sure we continue to educate the guys ... and just carry on."</p>

</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>HOW IS IT SPREAD?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>CONTAGIOUSNESS</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>TREATMENT</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>VaccinAtion</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province adds groups to immunization list</b>
</div><div>Anne Kyle   </div>

</p>
<p>In anticipation of the arrival of 60,000 more doses of vaccine next Wednesday, the province has expanded its H1N1 pandemic immunization program to include additional at-risk groups.</p>
<p>"We hope to get it out to the regions (next) Thursday or Friday and the regions are currently looking at what clinics they might be able to run over the weekend,'' Saskatchewan's Chief Medical Health Officer, Dr. Moira McKinnon, told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>McKinnon said she hoped that by late next week or early the following week, the vaccination could be rolled out to all people who are immuno-compromised.</p>
<p>"From the data, internationally and in Canada, the people most at risk are those who have immuno-suppression -- they may be on high-dose steroids, receiving chemotherapy or have had an organ transplant. So people of all ages in that select group will be offered the vaccine,'' she said, adding specialty clinics might be set up at hospitals, cancer clinics and renal dialysis centres to deliver the vaccine to those immuno-compromised individuals.</p>
<p>The province is also planning to expand its immunization program to include all people 35 and under who have underlying health problems such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. A more explicit definition of the underlying health problems that fall into this category will be communicated in the coming days, she said.</p>
<p>Vaccine will also continue to be provided to health-care workers, children from six months to Grade 6, pregnant women, women up to four weeks post-partum, and people in remote and isolated communities, McKinnon said, noting there will be variances between health regions in how the vaccine is delivered and the timing of the clinics.</p>
<p>To date, 194,600 doses of H1N1 vaccine have been received. When the additional 60,000 doses are received and sent to the regions, there will be enough to vaccinate 28 per cent of Saskatchewan's population. While the vaccine is being given to the at-risk population sequentially as it becomes available, McKinnon noted it will not likely be available to the general, otherwise healthy population, until early December.</p>
<p>"The uptake (for the vaccination) is very good and the demand is very high. We estimate at least 75 per cent of the Saskatchewan population will be vaccinated,'' she said, adding the success of the program is dependent on the availability of the vaccine.</p>

</p>
<p>School divisions have begun to send consent forms home to parents of school-age children in Kindergarten to Grade 6, who are the next designated group of H1N1 vaccine recipients.</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region (RQHR) and the Sun Country Health Region are expected to begin the school H1N1 influenza immunization clinics on Monday. Times and locations of the clinics will be posted on the health regions' websites or provided through the individual schools.</p>
<p>The RQHR is also offering a special pandemic H1N1 immunization clinic at the site of the former Robert Usher Collegiate for children ages five years up to and including Grade 6 with underlying medical conditions such as chronic lung or heart disease, asthma, diabetes, cancer, lowered immunity, kidney disease, severe anemia or conditions treated for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).</p>
<p>"Immunization is one of the most effective ways to reduce the impact of the disease,'' said Dr. Shauna Hudson, medical health officer for Sun Country.</p>
<p>The purpose of the H1N1 immunization for school children is to help lessen the impact of influenza on students, their families, friends and communities.</p>
<p>Hudson said children who have had lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 are expected to have immunity and do not require immunization.</p>
<p>"However, there are no adverse effects if someone with prior lab-confirmed H1N1 infection receives the vaccine. The child's doctor may recommend that an immuno-compromised child with lab-confirmed H1N1 receive the vaccine,'' she said.</p>
<p>However, she added, if a child is experiencing influenza-like illness (cough, sore throat, fever) at the time of the local clinic for H1N1 immunization, the child should not attend that clinic until he or she is feeling well and has stopped coughing.</p>
<p>While the vaccines are being rolled out, health officials are continuing to urge residents to use good hand hygiene and cough etiquette and to stay at home if they are ill with flu-like illness until they have recovered.</p>
<p>H1N1 Question of the day</p>
<p>QUESTION: MY DAUGHTER JUST HAD A BABY. IS IT SAFE TO GET THE SHOT IF YOU ARE BREASTFEEDING?</p>
<p>Answer: The Public Health Agency of Canada states that women who receive the vaccine can safely continue to breastfeed their babies. The benefits of the antibodies in breast milk means that it continues to be the best way to keep your baby healthy.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Westjet Profit Down 46% On Slow Recovery; 'We're just scared'</b>
</div><div>Scott Deveau  </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>548 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.  </div>
</p>
<p>Sean Durfy, chief executive of West- Jet Airlines Ltd., was frank yesterday about why he wouldn't call a steady improvement in passenger traffic and ticket prices in recent weeks a trend: "We're just scared," he said.</p>
<p>Who could blame him? WestJet, like carriers around the globe, spent the past year in the worst revenue environment in the history of the industry as it cut fares to get people flying.</p>
<p>As a result, the Calgary-carrier reported its fourth-straight quarterly drop in profit yesterday. The carrier said earnings fell 46% to $34.1-million, or 24¢ a share, for the three months to Sept. 30. That was down from a profit of $57.9-million (45¢) for the same period last year.</p>
<p>The results were below the 27¢ a share analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>But the news was not all bad. In recent weeks, there has been a steady increase in both passenger traffic and fares at WestJet and its main rival, Air Canada, an early indicator that things may be on the mend.</p>
<p>"When we put in a fare increase, it's holding and our load factor is not being impacted, which is a good thing," Mr. Durfy said in an interview.</p>
<p>Forward bookings are also doing "very well," despite WestJet's plans to add five new aircraft to its network as part of an aggressive push into the Caribbean and Mexico this winter.</p>
<p>The carrier has yet to see much of a negative impact from the H1N1 virus, Mr. Durfy said.</p>
<p>But the question remains of how drawn out the recovery will be.</p>
<p>Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's chief executive, has said he expects it will be 12 to 18 months before ticket prices return to 2007 levels, and Mr. Durfy said WestJet is trying not to "shock" the market with higher fares as demand recovers out of the recession.</p>
<p>WestJet management was also hesitant to give guidance for what it expects in revenue per available seat mile (RASM)--a gauge of how much money it collects per passenger -- in the final three months of the year. It would only say it expected the days of "mid-double-digit-declines" were behind it.</p>
<p>"While this is encouraging, without more specific guidance on how RASM is progressing, the market is unlikely to be overly excited," said Cameron Doerksen, a Versant Parnters analyst.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WestJet has a number of initiatives in the pipeline to help fill its planes, Mr. Doerksen said, including the launch of its loyalty program in coming weeks and new code-sharing agreements.</p>
<p>WestJet plans to launch five such agreements by the end of 2010, including those with <span class="companylink">Air France-KLM</span>, <span class="companylink">Southwest Airlines</span>, and <span class="companylink">British Airways</span>. <span class="companylink">Cathay Pacific</span> is also expected to be a partner, which will allow WestJet to fill its planes with inbound international passengers from its partners‚ aircraft at hubs across Canada, and vice versa.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, hinges on the implementation of its new SabreSonic reservation system, which has led several delays and long waits at call centres in recent weeks as it made the transition.</p>

<p>While MPs were sitting in the House of Commons last night awaiting their turn to vote on the long-gun registry, some were also wondering why Bloc Québécois MP Claude Guimond was sporting a surgical mask.</p>
<p>After the vote, Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe said Guimond likely has the H1N1 flu - his daughter has it - but had to come to Parliament to vote because the Conservatives refused to "pair" his vote.</p>
<p>Duceppe said a request was made yesterday morning to have a Tory MP miss the vote to balance out Guimond's absence if he stayed home sick, but the request was refused.</p>
<p>"We asked again five minutes before the vote to pair him, they refused," said Duceppe. "I think it's just disgusting from the Tories to have such an attitude."</p>
<p>Dimitri Soudas, press secretary for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said the pairing arrangement "wasn't an option."</p>

</p>
<p>On Friday, the government's H1N1 vaccination program failed Michelle Goodman, who found herself running from CLSC to CLSC, pleading for someone to vaccinate her daughter, Hannah, who suffers from Crohn's disease.</p>
<p>Not only is Hannah, 14, on immunosuppressant drugs that could make her more susceptible to the H1N1 virus, but Goodman's husband, Steve, was home sick with swine flu.</p>
<p>It was a nightmare for Goodman, and her doctor, Ernest Seidman, only reinforced her concern when he called her Friday morning to say it was imperative that Hannah be vaccinated that day.</p>
<p>Armed with a letter from the Montreal Children's Hospital stating that Hannah suffers from a chronic illness and she and the whole household must be vaccinated immediately, and another letter from Seidman saying Hannah must be vaccinated that day, Goodman began a tour of CLSCs in quest of vaccines for Hannah and her brothers, Noah, 11 and Jacob, 8.</p>
<p>After waiting in lines, not only was she turned away from the first three vaccination centres, the personnel refused to even read her letters. Seidman offered to speak to a nurse by phone, but the nurse at that CLSC refused. At one CLSC, Goodman and her children were escorted out of the building.</p>
<p>Goodman, who is also a nurse, watched as a hospital employee who works in a gift shop was vaccinated while her daughter's high-risk case was refused.</p>
<p>"I was humiliated," said Goodman, who lives in Town of Mount Royal. "I had every reason to be a priority - I had H1N1 in my house, so (Hannah) was at greater risk. It was so unfortunate and unnecessary."</p>
<p>Finally, at 6 p.m., a nurse at the CLSC Metro - where Goodman had been turned away earlier - read the letter and agreed to vaccinate Hannah.</p>
<p>On Monday, the whole ordeal repeated itself as Goodman tried to get her sons vaccinated. Finally, on Tuesday, a nurse at the CLSC Côte des Neiges heard her story and administered the vaccine to the boys.</p>
<p>Seidman, director of the McGill Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre at the McGill University Health Centre, was appalled that Hannah was turned away from so many places.</p>
<p>"Because she is immunosuppressed, she could have a much more severe infection and deserves special attention," Seidman said in an interview yesterday). "She needed protection."</p>
<p>What's worse, he said, is that she's not unique. He's had other patients turned away under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>"High-risk patients should not be denied vaccination," Seidman said. "That's really unfair. Their immediate family members should get it, too."</p>
<p>Goodman did the right thing, he added, by tenaciously pursuing the vaccine.</p>
<p>Goodman said she suffered a day of undue stress for no reason. "I had to plead for my daughter's health," she said Tuesday. "I should never have been put through that."</p>

<p>KITCHENER</p>
<p>KITCHENER - Waterloo Region has enough H1N1 vaccine to last until the end of the week, medical officer of health Dr. Liana Nolan said Wednesday night.</p>
<p>But it's not yet known what, if any, impact that could have on local immunization clinics because it's still not clear how much new vaccine is on the way from the federal government.</p>
<p>"The issue right now is vaccine supply," Nolan said. "There will be some vaccine availability. We just can't say what that impact will be."</p>
<p>Clinics for priority groups in Waterloo on Thursday and Saturday are going ahead as planned.</p>
<p>For those people in lower-risk groups who haven't yet obtained the vaccine - and who may think it's too late to bother once it is available - Nolan still recommended getting the shot, calling new pandemic strains "unpredictable."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't think it would be the last time we will see it circulating," she said.</p>
<p>Nolan said about 1,400 shots were supplied at each of the two clinics already held this week, and reported that things ran much more smoothly in Cambridge on Wednesday than they had a day earlier in Kitchener.</p>
<p>"We certainly had a chance to put in place some lessons learned," Nolan said.</p>

<p>CAMBRIDGE</p>
<p>Clutching the wristband in her hand, Cindy Cipriano felt like celebrating.</p>
<p>"It makes you feel like you've won the lottery getting one of these," Cipriano said.</p>
<p>She was among hundreds lined up for the community H1N1 clinic at Jacob Hespeler Secondary School in Cambridge on Wednesday, and she got the wristband about two hours after arriving just after noon.</p>
<p>The line began moving quickly after the clinic doors opened at 2 p.m., with people quickly rushing inside the school out of the cold for their flu shots.</p>
<p>Cipriano - who has asthma and is in the high-priority group for H1N1 vaccination - was glad she came before the line really started growing.</p>
<p>"It's been an experience, but we've been one of the lucky ones," said Cipriano, whose family doctor is not immunizing people for the H1N1 virus. "Everything is so disorganized."</p>
<p>Waterloo Region's associate medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang was pleased about how the clinic was going in the early afternoon.</p>
<p>"I have the sense that it's going better today," Wang said.</p>
<p>More public health staff was outside moving through the line reminding people of the eligibility and handing out numbered wristbands.</p>
<p>"I think it's going faster," Wang said. "We tried to implement improvements."</p>
<p>Public health heard from people at Tuesday's clinic in Kitchener complaining they didn't see wristbands being issued.</p>
<p>"We know we had to improve on that," Wang said. "We appreciate the feedback from people. We know it's difficult standing in line."</p>
<p>Tuesday's clinic at the Stanley Park Community Centre was closed at 4 p.m. and again around 7 p.m. because public health staff worried there were too many people waiting to get the vaccine before the clinic ended at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Beverly Quinlan was among the first to line up at the Cambridge clinic around 9:30 a.m. Her youngest son, eight-year-old Francis, has asthma and she was eager to get him immunized.</p>
<p>"We didn't want to take the chance on not getting through today," said the Cambridge mother. "I think I'd feel better once he had it."</p>
<p>"I would feel better if everybody could have gotten them," Quinlan said.</p>
<p>There's another clinic on Thursday at the Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex from 2 to 8 p.m., and then Saturday's clinic was moved to St. David Catholic Secondary School at 4 High St. in Waterloo for more parking. It runs from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Canadians have been lining up across the country to get an H1N1 flu shot, but it may not be just themselves and their family members they have to worry about when it comes to contracting the virus.</p>
<p>Some pets may also be susceptible to the disease.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, U.S. officials confirmed that a 13-year-old cat was infected with H1N1 flu. The domestic shorthair was treated last week at Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine and has recovered.</p>
<p>"We've known certainly it's possible this could happen," said Tom Skinner, a spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. "This may be the first instance where we have documentation that transmission occurred involving cats or dogs."</p>
<p>H1N1 flu was also confirmed in two pet ferrets in Oregon and Nebraska. Stormy, one of four pet ferrets owned by a Nebraska family, died last week after all the animals contracted H1N1 influenza from their owners.</p>
<p>Scott Weese, an expert in zoonotic diseases at the University of Guelph, said the animal cases underscore the need for owners of companion animals to realize that "pets are part of the household microbiologically, not just socially."</p>
<p>"So if you have an infectious disease, you try not to transmit it to your family members, and your pets should be part of that."</p>
<p>Weese said there are no hard data on which species of pets are vulnerable to H1N1 influenza. But he said ferrets, which are often used as a research model for human infectious diseases, are likely the pets most vulnerable to certain flu strains.</p>
<p>"One of the big questions is pet birds and pet pot-bellied pigs," he said. "Pet birds and pet pot-bellied pigs would be the next ones I'd be worried about because we know that these are susceptible to influenza."</p>

<p>Health Canada issues warning over H1N1 flu scams</p>
<p>Health Canada and the Competition Bureau have issued a new warning about H1N1 flu scams. They are urging Canadians not to purchase products claiming to fight or prevent the H1N1 flu. Health Canada said on its website late Wednesday it is working with the Competition Bureau and the RCMP "to address unauthorized products, including those with fraudulent claims to treat or prevent the H1N1 flu virus." Health Canada said it has only authorized three products - the H1N1 vaccine Arepanrix, and the antiviral drugs Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir).</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Feds, provinces to spend $400M on rollout of H1N1 flu vaccine</p>
<p>OTTAWA - That H1N1-flu shot isn't coming cheap. Newly released figures show it will cost Ottawa and the provinces $400 million for the H1N1 vaccine, not including related costs. The federal government is picking up 60 per cent of the tab for 50.4 million doses of the vaccine, while the provinces and territories will foot the rest of the bill. Ottawa will spend another $78 million on related costs incurred by Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>Rights advocate wants inmates to get H1N1 priority status</p>
<p>Prisoners' rights advocates want inmates to get priority treatment with the H1N1 flu vaccine. They say there's a greater risk of them spreading the virus and call it a public-health issue that concerns all Canadians. Craig Jones, the executive director of the John Howard Society of Canada, says convicts aren't necessarily health-conscious to begin with and live together in crowded conditions. He says this increases the risk of them getting H1N1 and giving it to other convicts and staff, and spreading it on to the general population.</p>

<p>Forensic expert testifies</p>
<p>at Mountie murder trial</p>
<p>A forensic expert has testified that a gun involved in the fatal shooting of a northern RCMP officer appears to have been fired from very close range. John Marshall was on the stand in the first-degree murder trial of Emrah Bulatci, who is charged in the October 2007 death of Const. Christopher Worden in Hay River, Northwest Territories. Marshall told jurors that gunshot residue taken from the slain officer's jacket suggests the gun was fired twice from within 15 centimetres of the 30-year-old Mountie's body. He also testified that the bullets came from the same .40-calibre Smith and Wesson handgun that witnesses have testified Bulatci was carrying while in Hay River.</p>

<p>Committee looks to question Hillier on Afghan prisoners</p>
<p>A special Commons committee wants to question Canada's former top military commander over the handling of Afghan prisoners. Gen. Rick Hillier is among the witnesses to be called before the committee on Afghanistan. The hearings over the next few weeks will look at what the government and senior commanders knew about the possibility of torture in Afghan jails and whether there was a coverup. Richard Colvin, a diplomat whose warnings about torture early in the mission went unheeded, is also to be called. The government has cast a blanket national security exemption over a lot of information related to the case - a move that derailed an investigation by the Military Police Complaints Commission.</p>

</div><div>By Joan Bryden   </div>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The Harper government is compelling cash-strapped municipalities to pay millions for thousands of signs touting the federal economic action plan, Liberals charged Wednesday.</p>
<p>Municipalities must sign an agreement that includes a provision requiring them to produce, erect and pay for economic action plan signs at each project site before they can get a share of the $4 billion federal infrastructure stimulus fund, Liberal House leader Ralph Goodale said.</p>
<p>The cost of most infrastructure projects are shared equally by federal, provincial and municipal governments.</p>
<p>Yet the Liberals said the Harper government is insisting that a separate sign - promoting only the federal contribution - be erected at each site.</p>
<p>"Local tax dollars are being forced to finance Conservative propaganda," Goodale said in the Commons. "While millions of Canadians cannot get vaccinated (against H1N1 flu), the Conservatives are not only wasting up to $45 million on useless signs but they actually want two signs, not just one, on every project."</p>
<p>"They're literally doubling the cost of signage and advertising . . . It's a ridiculous waste of money. It's an abuse of the public purse for the benefit of the Conservative Party of Canada."</p>
<p>Goodale's cost estimate was apparently based on a newspaper report that calculated the cost at anywhere from $5 million to $45 million for 2,500 signs already installed and another 4,000 on order.</p>
<p>Transport and Infrastructure Minister John Baird defended the signs, calling them a demonstration that the three levels of government "have put partisan politics aside and are working constructively to create jobs and to build infrastructure."</p>
<p>Liberals have criticized the government for using its efforts to stimulate the sputtering economy to promote the Conservative party.</p>
<p>They've argued that taxpayer-funded television ads echo partisan Tory messaging.</p>
<p>Liberals claim taxpayers have paid as much as $100 million for the promotional effort.</p>
<p>Government estimates last spring pegged the cost of advertising the economic action plan at</p>
<p>$34 million, spread over four departments.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Events have suddenly turned against Harper's Conservatives</b>
</div><div>James Travers   </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Not much is more certain to blow a government off course than events. First observed by former British prime minister Harold Macmillan, that old axiom is Stephen Harper's new reality.</p>
<p>Days ago Conservatives had a breeze at their back. Now they're twisting in winds they can't control.</p>
<p>First there were those big, blue, bogus stimulus cheques and then came the H1N1 flu with its viral mix of fear, confusion and queue jumping. Now watchdogs are barking at too-sunny economic forecasts and who-cares crisis readiness.</p>
<p>Each alone would be a problem for any government. Together they threaten the trend Conservatives count on to transform their current minority into a majority.</p>
<p>Given the violence of political pendulum swings, Harper could still grasp his Holy Grail. Liberals remain in disarray and 2010, beginning with the Olympics and continuing through an unusually long list of events that flatter prime ministers, is particularly promising.</p>
<p>But it's also true that the cornerstone of Conservative success is suddenly stressed and in danger of cracking. Canadians who decided that the ruling party is competent to manage the nation's affairs now have worrying personal reasons to reconsider that assumption.</p>
<p>Their conclusion always made too light of the weight of available evidence. Inadequate as the government's immunization plan is now proving, its financial stewardship has long been inept. Along with missing an imminent recession and hiding inevitable deficits, the faux-economist Harper gnawed through an inherited $13 billion surplus with politically charged tax cuts and runaway spending.</p>
<p>Canadians already concerned about family health will soon be paying the price for those financial mistakes. Kevin Page, the federal budget officer Conservatives put in place and are now trying to silence, is contradicting the Conservative claim that the return of good times will rescue the country from long-term structural deficits. If Page is prescient - and his gold standard work to date only inspires confidence - Harper will have to break his word not to raise taxes or cut services to balance Ottawa's books.</p>
<p>Page isn't alone in finding fault. A single thread weaves through Auditor General Sheila Fraser's Tuesday reports on the government's performance. From preparing for emergencies to guarding against abuse of foreign workers to delivering foreign aid, Conservatives boast a better game than they play.</p>
<p>That criticism is hardly unique: Fraser became a national icon, as well as a local voice of sanity, by showing no fear or favour in her eviscerations. But her latest deconstructions are a direct challenge to the carefully crafted illusion that Conservatives are delivering the better government they promised.</p>
<p>Strip that illusion away and what's mostly left is a highly-secretive, hyper-partisan administration benefiting by favourable comparison to a fractured opposition that has yet to convince voters it could do any better. A similar dynamic helped Liberals form four successive governments, a string of victories broken only when citizens, taxpayers and voters lost trust in the party's ethics and competence.</p>
<p>Conservatives haven't yet reached that tipping point. Their ability to fashion broad support from narrow interests is unmatched, as is the positive perception of the prime minister's leadership.</p>
<p>But events that blow governments off course also expose frailties. Winds that once filled Harper's sails are now in his face, slowing momentum and whipping doubt into dust devils.</p>

</p>
<p>THUNDER BAY</p>
<p>Though dealing with flu symptoms is challenging enough for health care workers, Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre is using this fall's season to fine-tune a system that will eventually benefit those who can't get to the hospital to visit patients.</p>
<p>Later this month - as hospital visits become restricted because of concerns over the H1N1 virus - visitors will be able to see and talk to patients through existing video-conferencing technology.</p>
<p>The so-called virtual visits are "part of a long-term strategy" to allow family members from remote or outlying areas to interact with patients at any time of the year, hospital spokesperson Don Edwards said Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the short term, while flu remains a concern, the hospital will be able to limit the number of visitors coming into the hospital by setting up a videconference station at the hospital's on-site medical centre.</p>
<p>Each patient will be allowed to have at least one visitor.</p>
<p>The Thunder Bay facility is modelling its virtual visits on a system already in place at Sioux Lookout's Meno Ya Win Health Centre, which serves patients from many remote fly-in aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hospital says the number of flu cases it is seeing so far is consistent with a typical fall flu season.</p>
<p>All of the 375 beds are full and 37 patients are in isolation because of respiratory issues.</p>
<p>The emergency department, which received more than 400 people one day last week, continues to get more than its daily average of 270 people.</p>
<p>The number of people coming into the emergency department with flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever ranges from 30 to 50 per cent, the hospital said.</p>
<p>Screeners continue to outfit incoming patients with surgical masks if they are exhibiting flu symptoms.</p>

<p>It really makes me mad, with all the publicity about H1N1 and that it’s a pandemic and should be taken seriously. If that’s the case, why are the flu clinics only a few hours long, and why do they shut down early on the weekend?</p>
<p>They should have 24-hour clinics so that everyone who wants to can get the needle. Instead, they are just a few hours in length and have to turn away people who might be in the high-risk category and need the vaccine. The public shouldn’t have to stand in line for hours ahead of time to make sure they are able to get the much-touted, critical, life-saving, government-issued flu vaccine (and then risk being turned away at the door).</p>
<p>I believe there are more deaths attributed to pneumonia and regular flu each year. I think the whole thing is just a cash-cow for the pharmaceutical company producing it.</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 shots for high risk only - Nov. 2</p>
<p>I just read The Record article on line about the H1N1 flu vaccination clinic at Huron Heights Secondary School. I arrived at 8:30 a.m. and there were probably 1,000 people in front of me. I have asthma, and am therefore considered high risk. After 2 1/2 hours outside, and the potential of another two inside, I left. I had another appointment I couldn't miss.</p>
<p>This clinic was to be for high risk individuals, but it seems with the hysteria those not at risk do not care; they want the vaccine.</p>
<p>It was not being monitored and had I known it was for everyone I wouldn't have wasted my time.</p>
<p>From what I've seen, this delivery system is poorly planned. If they had the capability to provide 2,000 people with the vaccine at Huron Heights high school, why not spread it among three or four schools, thus eliminating the four to five-hour wait. Also, if doctors had been mandated to provide the shot to high risk patients - whom they would readily know - the system would have run much smoother. My doctor and his consortium are not giving the shot. One woman in line said her doctor was, but only to children under five. She has six- and four-year-olds.</p>
<p>The shortage is new, but the problem is not the shortage, it is the flawed delivery system. When little children must wait outside for hours, then inside again for hours, there is a problem. I wonder if the group that determined the delivery system asked the general public their opinion. It might have been beneficial and actually helped to streamline the process.</p>
<p>I am not sure if I will wait another four hours in line to get my shot. My son is also very high risk and feels the same way. Maybe they should revisit how they provide the vaccine within the next week so the remaining doses can be given in a manner that doesn't have people waiting in line for four to five hours. And when more vaccine becomes available it can be administered in a more time-efficient manner.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>While many Canadian companies fret about how to deal with staff shortages and dropping revenue from the H1N1 flu, others are profiting from growing demand for everything from hand sanitizer to medical advice.</p>
<p>BMO Nesbitt Burns calculated that a mild pandemic would cut Canada's annual economic growth by two percentage points, while a severe outbreak would cut growth by six percentage points due to absenteeism and reduced consumer demand.</p>
<p>But not all companies will be affected equally and many are already poised to turn a tidy profit.</p>
<p>Montreal-based medical equipment maker <span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>. has seen demand for its antimicrobial surgical face masks and its Azuro brand hand sanitizer soar since the flu first appeared in Mexico last April.</p>
<p>Noveko spokesperson Chantal Vennat said the company sold 20,000 litres of hand sanitizer in total last year. Since the end of April, it's been selling 20,000 litres a week.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Noveko's biggest problem has been keeping up with demand. Although it contracts out production of its products, Vennat said it's been challenging mobilizing producers quickly enough and it has had to turn some orders down.</p>
<p>Despite this, Noveko has managed to increase production of its masks from one million a month to nine million a month since April.</p>
<p>"Right now we have firm orders for more than 100 million masks all over the world. Two weeks ago, we just released an order for 100 million masks for some regions in South Asia over the next three years," Vennat said.</p>
<p>That deal was valued at about $25 million.</p>
<p>Other companies are hoping to profit from less tangible responses to the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>In September, Montreal-based AXA Assistance launched a pandemic assistance hotline to help companies develop a contingency plan and reduce the disruption in their day-to-day activities caused by the flu.</p>
<p>"Of course, we hope (the pandemic) will not be critical. If it stays like (it is), it's good news, but if it gets worse we'll be ready to help them out," AXA Assistance director Patrick Collette said.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>With the rising incidence of infectious illness in the community, Guelph General Hospital began tightening visiting rules Wednesday.</p>
<p>They'll be tightened even further next week.</p>
<p>Starting Wednesday, every visitor is to wear a surgical mask.</p>
<p>Visitors must also be 12 years of age or older. They had already been required to use hand sanitizers when entering the acute-care hospital as a precaution this flu season.</p>
<p>Starting Tuesday, each hospital patient will be allowed to designate only two people without symptoms of illness to visit during a typical hospital stay.</p>
<p>Each patient will be issued two wrist bands to give to visitors, who must wear these in order to enter a patient ward.</p>
<p>These designated visitors will be allowed to come to the hospital only during visiting hours of 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Some exceptions will be made for compassionate reasons in extenuating circumstances, the hospital said Wednesday in a release.</p>
<p>Strains of illnesses are currently circulating in the larger community, including the pandemic H1N1 and seasonal flu.</p>

<p>Ontario will run out of the regular H1N1 flu vaccine by the end of the week, forcing many immunization clinics to close and preventing priority groups from receiving the flu shot, Health Minister Deb Matthews said Wednesday.</p>
<p>She declined to name the day the province will run dry, saying some local health units will deplete their stockpiles faster than others.</p>
<p>"We will be exhausting the supply we have by the end of this week," she said.</p>
<p>Ontario has enough vaccine to immunize 2.2 million residents, which the government plans to do by the end of the week, said provincial health officials. But that isn't enough to vaccinate all 3.4 million people who fall into the high-priority groups.</p>
<p>The province will backstop health units that are running out with an additional 189,000 doses of the regular vaccine it received over the week, said Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health. It also has 86,800 doses of the unadjuvanted vaccine intended for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the House of Commons that 1.8 million doses of the regular H1N1 vaccine will be shipped to the provinces next week, but King said she hasn't been told when the new supplies will arrive or how much Ontario will get.</p>
<p>"I think it's reasonable to say that it's difficult to plan when you don't know from week to week how much product you're going to get," she said.</p>
<p>"So that is a primary point of disappointment right now and difficulties with planning."</p>
<p>Matthews said some health units, such as one in North Bay, could run out of vaccine as soon as Thursday.</p>
<p>That's because Ottawa has dramatically curtailed its delivery of the regular vaccine just as public health units are ramping up efforts to administer the flu shot to priority groups like pregnant women and young children, she said.</p>
<p>"Right across the province, our public health units are working overtime, they're expanding the hours, they are getting the vaccine out and protecting Ontarians as quickly as they can," Matthews said.</p>
<p>"So the issue is not our ability to deliver the vaccine. The issue right now is supply."</p>
<p>If a local health unit has more vaccine than they can administer to the high-priority groups, those supplies will be "redeployed" somewhere else, Matthews added.</p>
<p>Both the provincial and federal governments will have to work together to address the vaccine shortage, said Premier Dalton McGuinty.</p>
<p>"I think Ottawa is feeling the heat, both from the opposition parties and from their sense of responsibility," he said from Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont.</p>
<p>"I think they are very likely doing everything that they possibly can to secure as much supply as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Supply of the vaccine hit a snag last week after Quebec manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> switched from making the adjuvanted version of the vaccine - which contains a booster compound - to making special unadjuvanted batches intended for pregnant women.</p>
<p>The changeover apparently slowed production of the H1N1 vaccine more than the drugmaker had expected.</p>
<p>Alberta ran out of the vaccine and is temporarily closing clinics this week. Other provinces have also warned of dwindling supplies.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have accused the Ontario Liberals of bungling the vaccine rollout following the chaotic scenes that unfolded last week at some immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Many people, including pregnant women and children, waited all day to get a flu shot - sometimes in the rain - and many were turned away.</p>
<p>Last week's problems were "unacceptable," Matthews said, but the province is still on track to have more than two million people immunized by the end of the week.</p>
<p>It's unclear how the province will achieve that ambitious goal in just a few short days, as officials will only confirm that "several hundred thousand" people have received the flu shot since the rollout began last week.</p>
<p>Matthews hinted that the province may add school-age children to its list of priority groups once the vaccine supply increases, which Saskatchewan has already done.</p>
<p>Ontario has seen 37 H1N1-flu related deaths since April and 108 people have been hospitalized with H1N1, King said. Sixty-five of those 108 people are in intensive care.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>In the Flames' defence</b>
</div><div>National Post</div>
<div>449 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>(From The National Post, November 6, 2009) An editorial yesterday incorrectly identified Brian Day. He is the past president of the Canadian Medical Association. ***** </p>
<p>"Not acceptable." "Deplorable." "A very serious error in judgment." These are the reactions from government politicians and spokesmen to the revelation that Calgary Flames' players and their families were provided H1N1 vaccinations last Friday, while thousands of less privileged Albertans toughed it out on line. "This is a travesty of leadership and it's a violation of the basic principles of public health care," provincial Liberal leader David Swann thundered. Premier Ed Stelmach has promised an investigation. Yesterday, a senior Alberta Health Services staffer was fired over the issue.</p>
<p>If their outrage is sincere, it's bafflingly selective. Have they never noticed that when hockey players need, say, an MRI scan, they just sort of magically get them? According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, in 2008, the median MRI wait time for outpatients in Alberta was 41 days. In February, according to a Calgary Herald report, two dinged-up Flames flew home from Minneapolis after a Thursday night game and got MRIs, and diagnoses, on the Friday. Nobody so much as batted an eyelash.</p>
<p>It's not just Calgary's millionaires on ice refusing to adhere to Canada's one-queue-for-all ideal. It's customers of Canada's private clinics, where people pay $2,000 and up for a head-to-toe medical workup. (The taxpayers don't pay for that, but of course they do pay to treat any ailments the workup reveals.) It's people who'd rather pay out of pocket for a next-day diagnostic imaging appointment in Buffalo, N.Y., or Bellingham, Wash., than stay home and accept a much longer timeline. It's people like Brian Day -- founder of Vancouver's private, for-profit Cambie Surgery Centre and president of the Canadian Medical Association -- who admitted in 2007 he'd used his connections to catapult him and his family up the queue. And it's every other person who, worried for his or his family's health, understandably pulls whatever strings he can to secure speedier service, necessarily pushing the unconnected -- immigrants, seniors, the poor --down the queue.</p>
<p>However many tiers of health care you think there ought to be in Canada, it helps no one to pretend that there has ever been, or that there will ever be, just one. Clearly we are a nation encumbered by fantasies about the current state of our universal health-care system. This doesn't augur well for the deadly serious conversation we need to have about its future and sustainability</p>

<p>HAPPY OLYMPIC TEAM</p>
<p>Team Canada will be unveiled on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Steve Yzerman's management group has selected Dec. 31 as the day they'll announce the 23-man roster for the Olympic men's hockey team.</p>
<p>Hockey Canada is still working out details of where the announcement will be made.</p>
<p>The 12 countries involved in the Olympic tournament will announce their rosters between Dec. 23 and Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Belarus will be the first to go and the Americans will be last.</p>
<p>Canada opens the Olympic tournament on Feb. 16 with a game against Norway at Vancouver's GM Place -- dubbed Canada Hockey Place during the Games.</p>
<p>WILDCATS SICK CATS</p>
<p>Two players with the Moncton Wildcats hockey team have tested positive for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Team doctor Martin Robichaud has also confirmed that 15 additional players and team staff are suffering from similar symptoms. The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League team has been advised that in the best interest of all concerned, the infected players and staff should be quarantined for about seven days.</p>
<p>The league has decided to cancel the Wildcats' games on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The Wildcats players were given vaccines for seasonal flu and H1N1 last week, but it takes eight to 10 days for the H1N1 vaccination to take full effect.</p>
<p>The league's head physician, Dr. Sylvain Boutet, is recommending that all teams take preventive measures including vaccination for the swine flu.</p>
<p>IT'S ALL YOURS, FOR NOW</p>
<p>Another milestone was reached for the 2010 Olympics Wednesday as the City of Vancouver officially handed over the athlete's village to Games organizers.</p>
<p>Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson did the honours, saying the city has been the landlord of the village until now, and it's time for new tenants. Vancouver Olympic CEO John Furlong was full of praise for the village, calling it extraordinary.</p>
<p>He says the location of the village on the city's False Creek, with its views of water, mountains and downtown towers, will help inspire the athletes to the performance of their careers. The athlete's village did not come without controversy, going millions of dollars over budget and requiring the city of Vancouver to come to its financial rescue after New York bankers pulled their backing when the economy collapsed. After the Games the village will return to the city of Vancouver, which will try to sell the suites as condos to recoup its investment.</p>

</p>
<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>WestJet Airlines Ltd. is offering a lot more seat sales to travellers than it has in the past as recession-weary consumers scrutinize every dollar they spend, says the chief executive of the Calgary-based carrier.</p>
<p>"We have felt over this recession how discretionary the buying of an airline ticket really is," Sean Durfy told analysts on a conference call to discuss his company's third-quarter results.</p>
<p>WestJet and chief rival Air Canada have been vying for customers by aggressively pricing their fares, a factor Durfy said led his company to post lower third-quarter revenues.</p>
<p>"It is intensely competitive in this marketplace," he said.</p>
<p>And it appears the recession is playing a much larger role in consumers' spending decisions than the H1N1 flu scare.</p>
<p>The virus first surfaced in Mexico in the spring, scaring travellers away from holidays in that region for a time.</p>
<p>However, that does not appear to be the case any more, Durfy said.</p>
<p>"Because we did have an issue with H1N1 in Mexico a while back, you would think there would be some skepticism from the travelling public but ... we're not seeing it," he said.</p>
<p>"I can't associate any booking declines with the H1N1 scare."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, WestJet added a twice-weekly flight to Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Mexico.</p>
<p>That brings the number of WestJet's Mexican destinations to six.</p>
<p>The airline also recently introduced several other routes to various Caribbean holiday destinations.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, WestJet reported profits of $31.4 million, or 24 cents per share, down from $57.9 million or 45 cents in last year's third quarter. Revenue fell to $600.6 million from $718.4 million.</p>
<p>Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were, on average, expecting earnings per share of 27 cents and revenues of $603 million.</p>
<p>Last month, WestJet overhauled its reservation system, which in its initial few days caused headaches for some travellers. The airline's website crashed, and its call centre was overwhelmed with an onslaught of callers.</p>
<p>"That won't happen again. These are one-time events," said Durfy.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Health Canada and the Competition Bureau have issued a new warning about H1N1 flu scams. They urge Canadians not to buy products claiming to fight or prevent swine flu.</p>
<p>Health Canada said on its website yesterday it is working with the Competition Bureau and the RCMP "to address unauthorized products, including those with fraudulent claims to treat or prevent the H1N1 flu virus." Health Canada said it has only authorized three products -- the H1N1 vaccine Arepanrix, and the antiviral drugs Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir).</p>
<p>Health Canada said it is monitoring the Internet and will take action against Canadian websites selling unauthorized products for the treatment or prevention of the H1N1.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>According to the Maple Leafs and Raptors, some players and staff have received the H1N1 vaccine, but both teams deny jumping the line for shots.</p>
<p>Under considerable pressure to say whether their players have been vaccinated against the virus, the Leafs issued a statement saying they were only following medical protocol by having their players injected.</p>
<p>"Any vaccine supplies received were obtained through normal distribution and no preferential treatment was requested nor received," the statement from spokesman Pat Park said in part.</p>
<p>The Leafs' stablemates at the Air Canada Centre, the Toronto Raptors, made a similar statement.</p>
<p>"Only certain players and staff have received the H1N1 vaccine," said Raptors spokesperson Jim LaBumbard.</p>
<p>LaBumbard told The Star the Raptors' medical staff procured the vaccine "through normal distribution and no preferential treatment was requested nor received."</p>

<p>EDMONTON</p>
<p>A health employee who let the Calgary Flames jump the swine flu shot queue was sacked yesterday as the controversy over preferential treatment to celebrity athletes spread to the Flames' farm team and beyond.</p>
<p>"Like most Albertans, I am deeply offended that this circumstance has occurred," Ken Hughes, chairman of Alberta Health Services, said in a news release.</p>
<p>Ken King, the Flames' team president, told open-line radio show host Charles Adler the pink-slipped employee "paid a huge penalty" for allowing Flames players, management and family members to get the vaccine last Friday.</p>
<p>King said he plans to reach out and help him or her find work.</p>
<p>"I don't know the name of that person, but I'm going to find out, and I'm going to speak with them, because I think that they thought they were doing a good thing for us," he said.</p>
<p>The Flames faced even more hot water yesterday when it was revealed the team's British Columbia-based top-tier farm team -- the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League -- had recently vaccinated most of its players.</p>
<p>In a news release, team president Tom Mauthe said the shots were given after most of the players fell ill on a recent road trip. They went to a public clinic for shots, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>On dusty bookshelves in many offices at Queen's Park you will find them -- multivolume reports on Walkerton, on Ipperwash, on forensic pathology, on wrongful convictions and more.</p>
<p>They are the work of judicial inquiries, ordered in the white-heat of crisis, usually years and millions of dollars in the making, released in a media spotlight, then consigned, as often as not, to the obscurity of half-measures and good intentions.</p>
<p>The late Archie Campbell understood that it's probably human nature to divert the gaze to other matters once any emergency has passed. But he hoped, and expected, that in matters of pandemics and public health things might unfold otherwise.</p>
<p>Campbell was the judge who led the inquiry into the SARS outbreak in 2003. He died in 2007 at 65, too ill to have attended the release earlier that year of his final report.</p>
<p>But what a clarion call it seems, in hindsight, against just the kind of lost focus and lost momentum that appears to have contributed to last week's H1N1 immunization fiasco.</p>
<p>What happened during SARS, Campbell concluded, was a failure of the system, declines in public health, decay of emergency infrastructure, a starving of resources -- all of which occurred through three successive governments of different stripes.</p>
<p>But "SARS taught us lessons that can help us redeem our failures," he said.</p>
<p>"SARS may be the last wake-up call we get before the next major outbreak of infection, whether it turns out to be an influenza pandemic or some other health crisis.</p>
<p>"This is why we cannot forget how bad SARS was."</p>
<p>When Campbell died, then-attorney general Michael Bryant said the judge's report had pulled no punches and that "his thorough work and thoughtful recommendations have made the province a better and safer place."</p>
<p>But Campbell knew better. He knew mere recommendations couldn't do that. He knew only commitment and action could. And he knew that required political will -- the most difficult of forces to sustain in a business of infinite demand and finite capacity. That's why Campbell's first interim report in April 2004 ended with such an emphasis not on matters technical, but on political will.</p>
<p>"The decline of public-health protection in Ontario reflects a consistent lack of political will, over the regime of many successive governments and all three political parties.</p>
<p>"It will require significant political will on the part of the Minister of Health and the Ontario government to commit the funds and the long-term resolve that are required to bring our public-health protection against infectious disease up to a reasonable standard.</p>
<p>"It would be very easy, now that the SARS outbreak is over, to put public-health reform on the back-burner. It is a general habit of governments to respond to a crisis by making a few improvements without fixing the underlying problems responsible for the crisis.</p>
<p>"It would be a tragedy if that turned out to be the case with SARS.</p>
<p>"There is no longer any excuse for governments and hospitals to be caught off guard."</p>
<p>When Premier Dalton McGuinty said, as he did this week, that in immunizing against H1N1 "there were some places where we didn't do as good a job as should have been done," he acknowledges failure.</p>
<p>When he says "one of the things we need to do when this is all over, is to bring the feds together with the provinces and territories and to ask ourselves questions about how we managed this," he acknowledges a breaking of faith.</p>
<p>With the Archie Campbells, with the Sheela Basrurs, with those who died of SARS. With all the lessons they taught that weren't adequately learned.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>How is the view from the lifeboats? This is the question I want to ask any adult who lined up for the H1N1 vaccine who is not in a high risk group, especially now that we are told there is a shortage.</p>
<p>When the tragedy of the Titanic unfolded, there was also a shortage, but it was for seats in lifeboats. Back then, it was women and children first, but some men took seats using money or station, and it is said that some even dressed as women to save themselves. Perhaps they can be judged less harshly when considering they had less than three hours to summon the courage needed to put others first and face almost certain death.</p>
<p>Today we have another tragedy unfolding. It's happening not in hours but in weeks, and the chances of death are not nearly as likely. But still we will see some healthy adults jumping the queue to get the shot for no other reason except self-preservation. It is these adults whom I wish to ask, "How IS the view from the lifeboats?"</p>

<p>Re: 'It's no time to encourage misinformation' (Opinion, Nov. 3)</p>
<p>... But it is a good time to look at what the alternatives to Western medicine have to offer, especially when it comes to boosting our natural versus acquired immune system, and especially this time of year during the flu season.</p>
<p>Our health system is under siege and the lineups and hysteria on H1N1 are a testament to the system we overly rely upon. We rely too much on solutions served up by pharma, hoping they will solve issues created by diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>The author of the article was right when he stated that we need solid investigative reporting, and his attack on naturopath Laura Margaritis was one man's opinion. We don't know fully what she or the other medical practitioner said. Having heard Margaritis speak intelligently on the issue of the immune system, which all of us should better understand, I know she is a competent and credible voice on this issue; and more, rather than less, should be done by The Spec to accurately report both messages.</p>

</p>
<p>It's telling, and damning, that federal Auditor General Sheila Fraser's scathing report on Canada's ability to deal effectively with a national emergency such as H1N1 has landed relatively quietly. It's almost as if most people already knew their senior levels of government had failed them, so Fraser's report comes as not much of a surprise.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding our cynicism about governments' ability to get the job done, we have every right to be outraged.</p>
<p>Six years. That's how long a draft federal emergency response plan has been waiting for cabinet approval.</p>
<p>"We found that the plan has not been formally endorsed by the (Conservative) government or other federal departments," Fraser said.</p>
<p>But don't worry, says Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan, because although the government hasn't actually endorsed the plan, it is operating under the draft version. So, after six years, the nation's emergency response strategy is governed by a plan that is apparently sound in draft version, but not sound enough to be formally adopted by the government?</p>
<p>This pandemic isn't SARS, after all. It didn't come as a surprise, nor is it much more severe than anticipated. World health authorities have been predicting it for months, warning us to prepare. Yet it arrives, and we find out there is no formalized strategy to deal with it. Just what has the Public Safety ministry been doing? And why is it that while the federal public service continues to grow at an astonishing rate -- it grew by 4.5 per cent or about 9,000 jobs last year alone -- the government cannot come up with a coherent, consistent, pragmatic system to deal with something as important as the largest vaccination program ever undertaken?</p>
<p>The harshest criticism for this failure should be laid at Ottawa's feet, because the federal government is in the best position to manage a challenge of national scope such as this one. But the provincial government has not covered itself in glory, either.</p>
<p>It's as if SARS never happened. During the extensive and high-profile forensics of how that emergency was handled, and what needs to be done differently, we heard time and again about the need for a collaborative strategy with emphasis on two-way, consistent communication protocol.</p>
<p>Along comes H1N1, with lots of notice, and what do we have? Different jurisdictions rolling out the vaccination program at different times and in different ways. Mixed messaging at the local, provincial, federal and even international level that unnecessarily increases anxiety and confusion at the time when people need calm and rational messaging the most.</p>
<p>Autonomy is a cherished principle in health care. But it may well be a liability in dealing with a pandemic or another health issue that doesn't respect local borders. Whether at the federal or provincial level, or through collaborative partnership, there needs to be a more central, consistent and transparent strategy that can be applied equitably and across jurisdictions. There will be more pandemics. Our governments need to get their acts together before that happens.</p>

<p>Doctors' offices are struggling to deal with high levels of illness and concern over the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"It's been extremely busy," said Dr. Danny Kraftcheck, who is seeing more kids with high fevers and dealing with increased parental anxieties and a surge of phone calls to his office. The calls are mostly about H1N1 -- from patients worried about their symptoms or asking if he has the vaccine yet.</p>
<p>Kraftcheck is trying to set up H1N1 shots for his patients. And his office is uploading patient records to the eHealth electronic system.</p>
<p>"We have to do all that in the midst of looking after people."</p>
<p>Yesterday, he was also interviewing applicants to fill a job in the office that opened in part "from the stress of being so busy."</p>
<p>"It's tough for everyone in the office, especially the phone calls."</p>
<p>The city's two flu assessment centres created on Saturday have helped, but he's still getting nine more walk-ins and 20 more calls a day than usual.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Tytus, president of the Hamilton Academy of Medicine, noted paperwork involved in the H1N1 vaccine -- something not required for seasonal flu shots -- adds "another bit of complexity."</p>
<p>Tytus has coped by rescheduling patients with flu-like symptoms to morning and late afternoon appointments and others to mid-day. He has removed all toys from the waiting room and increased cleaning staff to reduce H1N1 exposure.</p>
<p>Tytus is giving 40 per cent more seasonal flu shots this year because H1N1 news has also got seniors focused on seasonal flu, he said.</p>
<p>"I think it's been exhausting for family doctors," said Dr. Bill Krizmanich, Hamilton Health Sciences chief of emergency. They are carrying increased loads in their practices and doing their best to help staff assessment centres, he said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an ill Jamie Hamilton visited the Main West centre because he can't get in to see his doctor until Friday, said his wife Christine Beaumont.</p>
<p>Julie Liberty brought her eight-year-old daughter Lauren, ill with headache, fever and stomach aches, on the advice of her doctor's office.</p>
<p>"We're concerned, with all the things we're seeing (about H1N1) on TV," Liberty said.</p>
<p>ER visits at HHS this week are down to 15 to 20 per cent above normal, Krizmanich said. Last week, they were up by 65 to 70 per cent. The assessment centres are helping, but Krizmanich wonders if another wave is coming if more H1N1 vaccine isn't available soon.</p>
<p>"We're on a heightened sense of alert, waiting to see what happens next. This is not the end, I think."</p>
<p>In the four days since opening, the centres have seen 440 people.</p>
<p>The centres, at 690 Main St. W. and 2757 King St. E., are open 3-10 p.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends.</p>

<p>I was appalled when I read about how Calgary Flames players and their families were able to get the H1N1 vaccine before the rest of the public.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, the elderly, those with chronic health conditions, children, expectant mothers, and medical staff need the vaccine. But please, people, think about the hockey players.</p>
<p>What's worse is that Alberta Health Services went along with it. Why? Hockey players are at risk because of frequent physical contact, extreme exertion, and busy travel schedules.</p>
<p>I know, that sounds like what nurses do, but where are their vaccines?</p>
<p>This could only happen in Alberta, where private interests come first, and public interests come second.</p>

<p>My sister Ashley wrote to me recently about her concerns with regards to the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"Reading and watching all the reports, and then hearing about the conspiracy theories through emails and <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> clips, makes me hate being an adult and having to be informed on all this stuff. It seems being an adult means becoming more and more scared every day of virtually everything out there.</p>
<p>"I have heard so many different things on both sides of this swine-flu vaccine situation that I feel split in half. I am terrified to give it to my son and I am terrified not to."</p>
<p>My mind was on her questions when I went to yoga last Saturday morning. And, because everything happens for a reason, our class began with our instructor, Wanjira, speaking about making sure we took our time and were particularly patient with ourselves for the yoga session that morning.</p>
<p>"Make sure you work through everything you do today - slow, steady and comfortably. Don't do anything quickly."</p>
<p>I asked my teacher after class what she thinks about the H1N1 vaccination, and she said what I hoped she might: "I'm of the mind to wait and see for myself. However, it's far from simple, for I can empathize with those who have very young children, and with those who are elderly, sick and scared.</p>
<p>"It's hard to know what to think."</p>
<p>Last May, I wrote to be vigilant because H1N1 fears could be, in my opinion, a little media driven. I recommended to be careful in our immediate reactions to the hype because "pigs really only fly if we let H1N1 mania take flight."</p>
<p>That same week I met Darlene Anderson and learned about Beaconsfield's own Suitcases for Africa,which is dedicated to supporting orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya through education, nutrition and health care.</p>
<p>On top of learning how Suitcases began, I heard of Anderson's plan to revisit Kenya in the summer. I asked her if she would allow me to do a followup column.</p>
<p>This week, as the second wave hello to purported pandemic proportioned H1N1 fear is upon us, and as we all grapple with getting the flu shot or not, Anderson visited me again. And this time, she brought Wendy Buchanan, a photo album and plenty of stories.</p>
<p>If a picture paints a thousand words, then what does it say if we turn away from a picture in fear or disgust?</p>
<p>I don't want to diminish the justified concerns that we should have about the H1N1 pandemic potential. I have a baby and many relatives that are particularly concerned for their own valid reasons. Suggesting that this is a non-issue, or making light of it would diminish too many experts and any who have suffered from it at all.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I think we should be afraid. For after speaking with Anderson and Buchanan, I'm thinking that living in fear is the way to go!</p>
<p>And I'm not being facetious here.</p>
<p>Buchanan and Anderson spoke of the famine conditions in Kenya presently that have been amplified by this being the third year of an unrelenting drought. Word from Kenyan officials, Anderson said, is that 10 million humans (that's seven zeroes) face starvation in Kenya by year's end. Hunger has been declared a national emergency.</p>
<p>This seems to be another level of fear to be living, and dying, with.</p>
<p>And yet, amidst this horror, they both returned to Canada inspired with a spirit of hope. As Suitcases for Africa physically delivered on many projects and promises this past summer, the joy, compassion and optimism in the midst of the horror of starvation is what stood head and shoulders above all.</p>
<p>The determination, grace and joy that those with so little (materialistically) going for them and so much (comparatively) raging against, always shone brightest.</p>
<p>"We are so humbled by these patient, courageous people," they said.</p>
<p>We shouldn't need fear to be our impetus to choosing life and living well, here or anywhere.</p>
<p>And, compared with eternity, this to-vaccinate-or-not-to-vaccinate issue seems pretty small potatoes.</p>
<p>Imagine having no potatoes at all?</p>

<p>Alberta's provincial health authority has fired the most senior staff member involved in releasing H1N1 vaccine to Calgary Flames players and their families.</p>
<p>The name of the senior staff member was not released.</p>
<p>The investigation is continuing to determine how the Flames managed to jump the queue and get their H1N1 vaccinations before Albertans designated priority cases because of their risk of becoming dangerously ill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the H1N1 flu virus has forced the Moncton Wildcats junior hockey team to cancel two games.</p>
<p>The team announced yesterday that two players have tested positive for the virus and that more than two dozen other players and team staff have shown symptoms of the virus.</p>
<p>The Wildcats' games today and tomorrow have been postponed, said Gilles Courteau, commissioner of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Gagner becomes Quinn's centre of attrition; Coach's options limited with Horcoff, Comrie unavailable</b>
</div><div>Dan Barnes   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1022 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>His first-line centre, Shawn Horcoff, wasn't playing like one and is now nursing a shoulder injury that may take him out of action for 10 days.</p>
<p>The only other veteran, natural centre on the roster, Mike Comrie, has been too flu-bitten to play any position, other than prone, and prefers the wing anyway.</p>
<p>And the rest of the candidates are apparently precocious pivots, kids who were given big-league jobs before they earned them, according to Oilers head coach Pat Quinn, and haven't yet grown into the role of top drawer NHLers.</p>
<p>Oh, and as a group they have been too easy to play against, shut out three times, have lost five of their last six and the damn Flames got the H1N1 shots before they did. And we wonder why Quinn is crustier than all of his forwards, most toll booth operators and some Teamsters?</p>
<p>"If Horcoff is out, we've got four young kids in that position. So you name the No. 1," said Quinn, bristling at a question about Sam Gagner's readiness to fill those first-line shoes. "I don't care. (Lengthy pause to let the words hang just so). But we expect him to be the No. 1."</p>
<p>If I'm naming the first line centre, it's Gagner. He gets the nod over Comrie for reasons of health and foot speed. Neither one is a burner, but Gagner holds an edge and that's crucial in terms of the centre's responsibilities.</p>
<p>As for Comrie's desire to play wing, I'm sorry, but Quinn is the head coach and Comrie is the player. What part of that relationship precludes Quinn from pressing Comrie into service as the No. 1 centre if that's what the head coach thinks is best for the team?</p>
<p>At any rate, tonight against the New York Rangers, the flu makes Comrie a questionable starter while circumstance makes Gagner a centre on the (yet again) revamped first line, alongside Ales Hemsky and Dustin Penner, the team's best forwards and top point-getters. Gagner will play there the only way he knows how, with grit, a little flair and hopefully enough attention to defence to stay out of trouble in his own zone, something that his minus-1 rating suggests isn't impossible. Hey, they're a. 500 team and plenty of Oilers have worse plus/minus stats.</p>
<p>He will play that way unless and until Quinn decides it isn't working. Or Horcoff is healthy enough to return. Or Comrie decides he can play centre after all. Or Quinn gets all crusty and tells Comrie that's exactly where he's playing. Or Patrick O'Sullivan makes a bid. Or Andrew Cogliano breaks out of his offensive rut. Or Gilbert Brule steps up.</p>
<p>However, should you think of those as options and therefore see Quinn as a man with a veritable cornucopia of first-line centres at his beck and call, think again, because he didn't look like a man who enjoyed the choice he has to make.</p>
<p>"You don't just say you're a No. 1 centre because you're going into maybe a No. 1 slot," he said Wednesday after practice. "You've got to earn that. This young man(Gagner), this is his third year in the game. Would you call him a No. 1? Where is the No. 1 for you?I don't know. I mean, that's that BS about here's No. 1, here's No. 2, No. 3. You earn those positions based on what you accomplish in the game."</p>
<p>And with that as an entry point, Quinn launched back into one of his core themes; the organization made the conscious decision to play kids two years ago and he is living with the fallout from that decision, just as Craig MacTavish did before him.</p>
<p>"Were they ready to play in the National Hockey League? Probably not. But they decided we were going to do this. This was the policy of the Oilers this particular year and we're going to live with it. These coaches are going to help make these kids into top NHLers. Well, they're not there yet, but maybe they're on their way."</p>
<p>None of them will be there in seven to 10 days, Horcoff's apparent recovery period. But somebody has to fill the hole as best he can. I like Gagner's chances. He stepped into that role for a game against Columbus and the trio had 13 points, though most of it was the result of Penner and Hemsky taking the game by the scruff of the neck and shaking points out of it. He lost that spot only because Quinn wanted to get Horcoff going on offence, which didn't exactly pay off.</p>
<p>"It's a tough hole to fill," Gagner said. "Horc obviously brings a lot of elements to our team. He's really been a huge part of our team even if he hasn't put up the amount of points he's accustomed to. Guys have to step up and score some goals for us."</p>
<p>One player's setback is seen as an opportunity for someone else, but in this case, it's more than one Oiler. Horcoff takes more draws than anybody in the Western Conference and that responsibility will be shared. He also kills penalties and sees second-unit power-play time and those two roles will not go to the same player.</p>
<p>But if Gagner produces offence immediately, those first-line minutes will likely be his and his alone until Horcoff returns.</p>
<p>"Whoever I play with, it doesn't change my preparation or focus," said Gagner. "I can't let it. There are going to be things thrown at you in this game that you can't control. You've got to be ready."</p>
<p>He's not a No. 1 centre, but he's ready.</p>

<p>- Our neighbourhood doctor was told to stand in line for his flu shot, yet he is expected to treat patients with the swine flu?Um, what's wrong with this picture? - Shame on Alberta Health Services for not screening for high-risk people to get the flu vaccine. Shame, too, on those who waited in line who weren't high risk. - Leave Alberta Health Services alone. If people had abided by the guidelines of those who should receive the shots, there would be no shortage of the vaccine. - Couldn't we have used our electronic health records to ensure the people at high risk received the flu shot first? - I think I'll just wait for H2N2, thanks. - According to The Journal, Canada's chief public health officer was pushing the message that taking the flu shot is our civic duty.</p>
<p> So we shouldn't be calling the people who decided to get vaccinated the "irrational, illogical and panicked masses." - Based on the reaction to the flu shots, I would now be reluctant to go to sea with a number of Canadians based on their understanding of the protocol of "women and children first." - First, Ron Liepert apologizes for the H1N1 mistakes, the endless lines, vaccine thrown in the garbage, closed clinics and high-risk people being ignored. Now he believes the program was a success? - Using Liepert's brazen style of reasoning, even the Hindenburg's maiden flight could have been declared somewhat of a success. In spite of catching fire and exploding upon landing, the airship had impressively carried 97 people across the Atlantic. - None of the Calgary Flames are pregnant, or under the age of six. So why did they get the vaccine? - It makes me ill to think healthy, millionaire hockey players receive the H1N1 vaccine quickly and conveniently while a working mother of two takes time off work, waits in line for two consecutive days and still does not have her children vaccinated. We should all be ashamed that this kind of injustice happens. - We overheard a conversation between an overzealous guy and an overweight woman that went like this: "Wow, congratulations!When are you due?" "I'm not pregnant!" Who knew that could be used to advantage in lining up for the flu shot? - Fredericton, N.B.: Eight flu clinics for 85,000 citizens;Edmonton: Seven flu clinics for one million citizens. Huh? - After watching the vaccination debacle last week, I agree with my son who said this government couldn't organize a rock fight in a gravel pit. - Gee, I can hardly wait for the Tories to blow up the new Capital Health Primary Care Centre before it becomes too much of an embarrassment for them. - I must have the swine flu, cause I'm sick of hearing about it. - Strathcona County has made it illegal to talk on cellphones while driving. So imagine my surprise when I saw the driver of a vehicle belonging to Strathcona County talking on a cellphone. - You don't dump your household garbage in a bus shelter. What we're you thinking? - Remind me again why gaining an extra bit of daylight at the beginning of the day when we're rushing off to work is better than gaining it in the evening when we have time to relax and enjoy it? - The only way to save Rice Howard Way is to close it to traffic and attract more upscale shops and restaurants. - A multimillionaire and his wife come to Canada from Britain for a holiday, and the Canadian taxpayer is stuck with the bill. Does that mean, when we go to his country, he will pay for our holiday? - The British monarch as Canada's head of state may be anachronistic, but at least it saves us from having to elect some awful president. - Instead of worrying about corruption in the Afghanistan election, President Obama should first clean up the corruption on Wall Street. The whole world would benefit. - At the end of the day, ramping up and rolling out seem to have become the phrases du jour in the media. - I love the new downtown street decorations, but can't we wait until after Remembrance Day to put them up?</p>

<p>Alberta Health Services ran a half-page ad in the Nov. 4 edition of The Journal headlined an "important update on the H1N1 vaccine."</p>
<p>The public announcement states: "Due to the unexpected national shortage of the H1N1 vaccine ...."</p>
<p>Incredibly, other news reports the same day suggest that Canada's "vaccine leftovers" are being sent abroad. <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the exclusive contractor to provide Canada with the vaccine finds itself with more antigens (the key component of the vaccine) than it can use. Hence, it is sending bulk shipments to other countries.</p>
<p>Are the federal and provincial governments even in touch with one another? Do any of these officials see the endless lineups of people waiting for the supposedly dwindling supplies of vaccine? How can Glaxo-SmithKline consistently undersupply the vaccine, yet ship the excess abroad? What is going on here?</p>

</div><div>Sarah Chernik   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>349 words</div><div>5 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>I cannot believe the government's pandemic plan had any significant input from medical experts in the fields of public health or contagious disease. There were too many mistakes.</p>
<p>The first mistake was the decision to hold mass vaccination clinics. To anyone who knows anything about highly contagious diseases, the worst thing you can do is bring potential carriers and highly susceptible victims together in close quarters. A better approach would be to bring the vaccine to the people in schools, workplaces and seniors lodges.</p>
<p>The second major mistake was the fact that most of the venues chosen required people to wait outside in late October. Someone standing in line for half an hour or more could easily become chilled. The immune system is weakened when people get chilled, tired, and hungry. The setup of these clinics lent itself to the breeding and spreading of any cold or flu, not just H1N1.</p>
<p>In the Nov. 3 Journal, Graham Thomson ( "Time province gets swine flu story straight; Government's mixed messages of past week put most vulnerable at risk") did an excellent job highlighting the many contradictory statements by government officials over the last two weeks. Until Sunday, the government encouraged everyone to come to the clinics. At no time was it explicitly stated that, if you are not part of a high-risk group, you should stay away. It should be no surprise to anyone that demand was overwhelming.</p>
<p>In real life, resources will always be limited, but with a little planning they can be made to protect as many people as possible. This is the role and the responsibility of governments, as only they have both the power and the position to look beyond the needs and concerns of individual citizens to address those of the population as a whole.</p>
<p>This where Ron Liepert can and should be held responsible, for this is the way in which the Alberta vaccination program was an absolute failure, regardless of how many vaccines were distributed over the last two weeks.</p>

<p>High risk, low risk, no risk. Go, don't go, go--wait countless hours and feel guilty for the pleasure. The perfect Alberta Advantage H1N1 flu policy ---an unqualified success story.</p>

<p>There are many questions regarding Alberta's H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>The government does not seem to have any statistics to tell us how many of the 400,000 Albertans vaccinated were at high risk or were health-care professionals. The government must have known how any units of vaccine it had before the program started. We can only suspect from the huge lineups that large numbers of low-risk Albertans were vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now we hear that the Calgary Flames players and their families were vaccinated. So much for government planning.</p>
<p>The Stelmach government should be thankful that this pandemic has not resulted in hundreds of deaths in the province. The pandemonium caused by that along with this ill planned vaccination program would have been horrendous. I hope that all Albertans have learned from this experience.</p>

<p>It has been said that the nurses and EMS personnel will have priority in being vaccinated against H1N1, but firefighters and police will have to wait until the vaccine is again made available to the general public.</p>
<p>Many people do not realize that the Edmonton Fire Department responds to all of the most severe medical calls that occur in our city. This includes any medical call involving respiratory distress, altered level of consciousness, and chest pain. In a nutshell, firefighters will be coming to give Edmontonians medical aid in the event they show symptoms of the H1N1 virus and call 911.</p>
<p>As a firefighter, I am proud of my duty to the citizens of Edmonton. I take great pride in my job, as do my colleagues.</p>
<p>It angers me, however, that the province has decided that my wellbeing, and that of my family and patients--whom I may infect unknowingly -- is second to other health-care professionals, and the Calgary Flames.</p>
<p>This is a slap in the face to every professional firefighter. Tonight, when I go to work, I will be thinking of my family--the family that I may infect as a result of the province's policies.</p>

<p>Which is more likely? The H1N1 shots for the Flames and their families were approved by a) the Zamboni driver at the Saddledome, or b) a high-ranking Tory with connections to Health Minister Ron Liepert?</p>
<p>Has Liepert been replaced yet? If not, why not?</p>

<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert has four major health fiascos on his doorstep:</p>
<p>-Forcing the closure of mental health beds at Alberta Hospital Edmonton and the ensuing muddle;</p>
<p>-Stephen Duckett's inappropriate offer of prizes for suggestions on cost-cutting measures;</p>
<p>-The conflicting messages regarding the H1N1 vaccine and who should be vaccinated;</p>
<p>-And now the revelation that, in collaboration with Alberta Health Services, the Calgary Flames arranged separate vaccination facilities for themselves and their families, while high-risk Albertans waited in the rain for hours.</p>
<p>If Liepert had any capacity to feel shame, he would apologize and resign immediately.</p>

<p>I don't often speak out against the government, but in this case some-one's head should roll.</p>
<p>Giving priority to a hockey team over millions of people--some of them in the high-risk group to receive the H1N1 vaccine -- takes the cake.</p>
<p>Since Ron Liepert is the health minister, I am sure he must have made the final decision. If so, he should do the right thing and resign. If Stelmach won't accept his resignation, then Stelmach should resign.</p>
<p>The people of Alberta are far more important than any sports team in getting this vaccine.</p>
