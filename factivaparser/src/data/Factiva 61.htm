<p>Two billion people -- or one-third of the world population -- will become infected if the human swine flu becomes a pandemic, the World Health Organization warned Thursday.</p>
<p>If the virus turns more virulent or becomes established in multiple countries outside North America, "if we do move into a pandemic, then our expectation is that we will see a large number of people infected worldwide," WHO's acting director-general Dr. Keiji Fukuda said.</p>
<p>Based on past pandemics, "it would be a reasonable estimate to say perhaps a third of the world's population would get infected with this virus," he said.</p>
<p>He said it was premature to predict how many people would get severely ill or die.</p>
<p>However, "when you look at a third of the world's population, and recognizing that we're a globe of a little over six billion people, that's a lot of people to get infected," he said. While most people get only a mild infection, the vast numbers involved in a worldwide pandemic mean that "there are still very large numbers of people who could develop pneumonia, require respirators, (and) who could die."</p>
<p>Still, Fukuda said there was no evidence the virus was establishing the kind of community spread in other parts of the world as it had in North America. He said WHO's pandemic alert remained at phase five on a scale of six.</p>
<p>"We remain at phase five. That has not changed. We continue to see human-to-human transmission, community-level transmission primarily in North America. We are not seeing it yet anywhere else."</p>
<p>On Thursday, WHO raised its global totals to 2,371 lab-confirmed cases of swine flu, including 44 deaths: 42 in Mexico and two in the United States. Twenty-four countries have reported cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection. Canada's public health agency confirmed 13 new cases across the country Thursday, bringing the national total to 214.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan confirmed its first two cases of swine flu Thursday, a teenager and a woman in her 20s, both of whom had travelled to Mexico. Both cases were mild.</p>
<p>Alberta reported three new cases, two of them children from central Alberta, neither of whom had a travelled to Mexico. Both have mild symptoms, unlike the Edmonton-area girl who was hospitalized this week after being hit more severely with the illness. Doctors said she was improving Thursday, but there was no word on when she was expected to return home.</p>
<p>Ontario reported seven new cases of swine flu, and Quebec reported one.</p>
<p>South of the border, the U.S. reported 1,823 probable and confirmed cases in 43 states.</p>
<p>A study by United States government scientists released Thursday revealed some signature features of the infection.</p>
<p>An analysis of the first 642 confirmed cases of human infection with the outbreak strain of swine flu found most involved typical, garden-variety flu symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat. However, about 38 per cent of cases also involved vomiting or diarrhea, "neither of which is typical of seasonal influenza," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team writes in the New England Journal of Medicine. The age of patients ranged from three months, to 81 years; 60 cent were 18 years of age or younger; only five per cent were 51 or older; 12 U.S. cases involved children under age one.</p>
<p>"It is likely that the number of confirmed cases underestimates the number of cases that have occurred," the authors said.</p>
<p>However, the journal's editors said that, although the first cases were identified little more than a month ago, "it seems unlikely that this outbreak will lead to widespread, severe illness and deaths."</p>
<p>"However, this may be just the first wave. ..."</p>
<p>In Geneva, Fukuda defended WHO's reasons for paying so much attention to swine flu, especially when reports suggest most cases so far have been relatively mild. Critics have accused the world health agency of overstating the risks. On April 25, WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern.</p>
<p>"From the beginning of this whole situation a few weeks ago, we have said over and over again that the situation is evolving and we really don't understand how things are going to go in the future," Fukuda said. That was true two weeks ago, he said, and remains true now. "We still don't know how the future is going to evolve."</p>
<p>Officials are nervously watching what happens as the Southern Hemisphere enters its winter season, when flu viruses typically thrive. Will the virus go to the Southern Hemisphere? If it does, what will happen?</p>
<p>Populations in developing countries can be more vulnerable to flu because of malnourishment, war and conditions such as HIV infections, Fukuda said.</p>
<p>When seasonal flu hits, "what has been relatively mild for populations in the developed world, in fact is quite severe in its impact in the developing world. These are very big concerns for us."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico called for an immediate lifting of bans on pork imports sparked by fears over swine flu. International Trade Minister Stockwell Day and his U.S. and Mexican counterparts called the ban by more than a dozen other countries unscientific and inconsistent with their international obligations.</p>
<p>"We urge our trading partners to remove these restrictions on our products immediately," Day, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Mexican Secretary of the Economy Gerardo Ruiz Mateos said in a joint statement. "We will continue to follow this situation closely, and will take any steps to prevent the enforcement of unjustified measures against our exports, as appropriate."</p>
<p>Day said those steps might include challenges at the World Trade Organization, which can often entail a long, drawn-out process.</p>

<p>CALGARY, EDMONTON --</p>
<p>A deceased Alberta woman has become Canada's first confirmed death associated with the influenza A/H1N1 virus, provincial health officials said today.</p>
<p>“It's not clear what role the H1N1 virus played in the fatality, which took place April 28,” Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health, said in statement.</p>
<p>The cause of death at that time was attributed to “chronic preexisting medical conditions.”</p>
<p>A source said it was originally believed the woman died from an asthma attack.</p>
<p>On May 5, health officials confirmed a family member of the woman contracted the virus and as a result further testing was order by the local health authority.</p>
<p>Lab tests confirmed the woman's death is linked to the virulent flu that has been sweeping around the world.</p>
<p>The deceased woman was in her 30s and, as far as officials know, had no prior travel history to Mexico, Dr. Corriveau told reporters in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Her case only came to the attention of health officials this week when an elderly woman in northern Alberta tested positive for the virus, which prompted a trace out to all her contacts.</p>
<p>Officials discovered that woman had been at a funeral of a close relative earlier this week, which was attended by about 300 people, many of whom would have been in close contact through hugging and kissing. Officials also turned their attention to the dead woman, who had been hospitalized before she died, and lived in the same house as the elderly woman.</p>
<p>“It came to light to us that the death was although unexpected at the time had been attributed most probably to be associated with preexisting, chronic medical conditions. There was no talk at the time of the death that flu had anything to do with the cause of death,” Dr. Corriveau said.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, tests on tissues taking during an autopsy of the young woman confirmed the presence of the virus.</p>
<p>Nurses have since travelled to the remote community in order to dispense treatment to those who need it and provide advice to residents. Anybody who had contact with the deceased woman would likely have symptoms by now. Officials said they know of no new cases in the region.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of Health for Alberta Health Services, said the cause of death still being investigated, but said her preexisting medical problems would predispose her to getting a more severe infection with influenza.</p>
<p>It appears the elderly relative likely contracted the virus from the deceased woman, officials said.</p>
<p>Dr. Corriveau asked the press to respect the privacy of the affected family and community. He also chastised the media for reporting on “rumours and incomplete information,” which resulted in reports that the death was in an elderly person or someone from Calgary.</p>
<p>“This has a negative an unnecessary impact ton the family and the general public and needlessly raises the anxiety in the community,” he said.</p>
<p>Officials counted nine new cases, including the deceased woman, in the Alberta bringing the total to 42.</p>

</p>
<p>American President Barack Obama pointed out last week that while the "typical president'' has to handle two or three big problems at once, he has had to juggle "seven or eight.'' Still, the new administration is managing to generate an impressive amount of energy and activism across that broad field. In foreign affairs, that raises a compelling question: Do the levers of American influence still work?</p>
<p>The question can be asked about the Middle East, Iran and North Korea, where the administration's special envoys and initiatives so far are showing few results. But it is coming to a head in Pakistan, where the Obama team has focused much of its attention and diplomacy the past two weeks.</p>
<p>This first big test has been something of a slow-burner, often neglected by media distracted by pirates and the N1H1 strain of flu, what most of the world is calling swine flu. Nevertheless, the accelerating power of Islamic extremists in a nuclear-armed state is as big and as scary a threat as any president has faced since the end of the Cold War -- and the administration has responded with an aggressive array of military, political, diplomatic and economic initiatives, in Pakistan, Washington and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The trouble is, it all may not work -- as senior administration officials frankly acknowledge. By year's end, Pakistan could morph into a catastrophe that overshadows those six or seven other big problems. That won't happen because the White House ignored it; but it may be the case that proves that U.S. global influence has receded to a dangerous degree.</p>
<p>The administration began by treating Pakistan as an adjunct to its strategy for Afghanistan, because Pakistan's western tribal territories serve as bases for the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaida. Yet in the past month, Pakistan suddenly has seemed to tip toward collapse as the Taliban rapidly expanded toward Islamabad while the country's army and weak civilian government dithered.</p>
<p>This is the sort of trouble U.S. administrations have often ignored until it was too late -- as in neighbouring Iran before its Islamic revolution. So it's been notable how quickly how many senior Obama administration officials have concentrated on Pakistan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chair of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, has almost camped out in Rawalpindi, the headquarters of Pakistani army commander Ashfaq Kiyani, visiting twice in the past month alone. President Asif Ali Zardari has been invited to Washington this week for a trilateral summit with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.</p>
<p>The administration organized a pledging conference in Tokyo three weeks ago that raised $5.5 billion in new civilian aid for the government. It is meanwhile talking to Congress about quickly approving $400 million in training money for Pakistani security forces fighting the Taliban, in addition to the billions in military and economic aid in future budgets. The National Security Council met last week to hear a new report by the U.S. intelligence community, which concluded that an Islamic revolution in Pakistan was not likely "in the near future.'' An intensive review has also begun of how Pakistan's nuclear weapons are secured and what might happen to them in an emergency.</p>
<p>Much of the focus flows from the administration's special envoy system at the U.S. State Department, which has served to bypass a sometimes sluggish bureaucracy. Richard Holbrooke, the czar for Afghanistan and Pakistan and a diplomat of legendary aggressiveness, has been showering Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the White House with memos on Pakistan, shuttling back and forth to the region, and bulking up his staff with outside experts.</p>
<p>All this activity has produced some tentative results. Under heavy American pressure, Zardari backed down from a potentially disastrous street confrontation with rival Nawaz Sharif; the administration is now trying to push Pakistan's two biggest civilian parties into an alliance.</p>
<p>Days after Mullen's last visit, the Pakistani army finally launched an offensive last week against Taliban forces that had infiltrated the Buner district, some 60 miles from the capital.</p>
<p>The administration is discovering, however, that its power to influence events in Pakistan is quite limited. Other than remote-controlled missile strikes, the United States has no direct means of stopping Islamic extremists from taking over the country.</p>
<p>"We have a list of things we can do, but at the end of the day they are inputs,'' one senior official said. "None of them can determine the internal dynamics of the country.''</p>
<p>In other words, energy and focus won't necessarily spare Obama from a foreign policy disaster. Yet those are the cards this atypical president has drawn.</p>

<p>EDMONTON</p>
<p>An elderly woman in northern Alberta who had the H1N1 flu has died, but it was not clear if that was the cause of death, the CBC reported last night.</p>
<p>It was not known if the woman had other underlying conditions, but she did have the virus at the time she died, the CBC report said, which did not provide any sources.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Leipert was asked about the death and said he has no information about it at this time.</p>
<p>A total of 44 people have died of the flu strain in Mexico and two in the US.</p>
<p>There have been 44 deaths in Mexico and two in the United States. In total, there are 214 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Canada.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan joined the list of places with H1N1 flu with health officials confirming yesterday the first positive cases in the province.</p>
<p>A teenage girl in the Saskatoon Health Region and a woman in her mid-20s from the Regina area have the H1N1 virus, said Dr. Moira McKinnon, provincial chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"Both have mild illnesses, both had vacationed in Mexico and both are well now,'' said McKinnon. "They don't pose any risk to anyone else at this stage.''</p>
<p>Neither the teen nor the woman required hospitalization.</p>
<p>The woman isolated herself, say officials with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region. Dr. Johnmark Opondo, the deputy medical health officer in Saskatoon, says the teenage girl "was not in school while she was symptomatic.''</p>
<p>"I think if there was any exposure, it may have been very minimal or mild. However . . . we will definitely be talking with the school and the school board,'' said Opondo.</p>
<p>"But we don't believe there was a lot of exposure in the school.''</p>
<p>Opondo said a couple of the teen's family members did have flu symptoms, but "they've all recovered now so there isn't an indication for doing any more testing.''</p>
<p>The teenager is expected to return to classes next week.</p>
<p>Ontario confirmed seven new cases, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 56. None of those were in this area, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health reported yesterday.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the cases in Canada have been mild.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu boast scaled back; Government wrong when it credited Winnipeg lab with decoding virus</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Some scientists outside Canada are scoffing at the federal government's claim that its research lab was the first to fully decode the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"The silly thing is . . . I think this race to be first is almost, well, people start doing silly things to be first. Not obstructing, but they don't give credit where credit's due,'' a scientist at a European lab told The Canadian Press. "I'm surprised at the (Canadian government's) claim because I don't see the evidence for it.''</p>
<p>The scientist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it's widely accepted the U.S. was first to decode the virus.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Canada announced its National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg had completed full virus sequencing of three sample viruses -- two from Canadian swine flu cases and one from Mexico.</p>
<p>And a news release on the Public Health Agency of Canada's website says "Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg first to decode genetic makeup of H1N1 flu virus.''</p>
<p>Genetic sequencing determines the order of molecules that make up the DNA in each gene of an organism. The work allows researchers to look for known mutations that are linked to antiviral resistance.</p>
<p>"This is the first complete sequencing of the H1N1 flu virus, and is vitally important to our understanding of the outbreak,'' Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference Wednesday in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"This is a world first and a real validation of Canada's scientific excellence.''</p>
<p>But Canadian scientists were far more nuanced in describing their accomplishment. Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said it was the first time full genetic sequencing has been done on an H1N1 flu virus from Mexico and Canada. His colleague Dr. Frank Plummer, the head of the National Microbiology Laboratory, said the lab sequenced the first Mexican and Canadian flu samples but was not claiming to have been the first to sequence any form of the virus.</p>
<p>Plummer said in an interview yesterday the staff who wrote the news release "misunderstood that, I think, in their enthusiasms for the findings.''</p>
<p>He also said Aglukkaq "misspoke'' at the news conference. "We knew that the CDC posted that genome (online), so we're not going to obviously claim that,'' he said.</p>
<p>"We certainly, we absolutely did not want to claim something we didn't do.''</p>
<p>American scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were the first to log the full genome sequence data in an open access database on April 27. "We're standing firm on the April 27th posting with CDC detecting the gene sequence for the H1N1 flu virus,'' said Elwin Grant of the CDC.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg lab determined an unusual outbreak of severe respiratory illness in Mexico was being caused by a new swine flu virus U.S. researchers had found was infecting people in the United States.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada kicks off fight over meat labelling; U.S. law</b>
</div><div>Paul Vieira </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>559 words</div><div>8 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>Canada formally kicked off a trade fight with the United States yesterday over a controversial meat-labelling law -- although Stockwell Day, the Minster of International Trade, held out hope that a quick resolution with Washington can be struck.</p>
<p>As it happens, the trade fight was launched on the same day that Ottawa, Washington and Mexico City issued a joint declaration that the NAFTA nations are prepared to take "any steps" against countries that impose "unscientific bans" on their pork and meat products due to the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Mr. Day signalled last week that a challenge to the World Trade Organization was in the works, and it was formally launched yesterday. The first stage involves a 60-day negotiation to see if Ottawa and Washington can reach a resolution.</p>
<p>The dispute concerns a meat-labelling law that requires meat and other foods sold at U. S. supermarkets to have labels that indicate from which countries the food originates.</p>
<p>Further, in February the Obama administration issued a letter to the U. S. meat-packing industry suggesting it undertake additional "voluntary" measures that are not in the law, including that labels be included on processed meats.</p>
<p>The law, plus these additional "voluntary" obligations, forced Ottawa to act, Mr. Day said, because it affects the ability of Canadian livestock producers to export to the U. S. market.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Day said he remained "optimistic" that Ottawa can avoid the quasi-judicial stage-- which can become prolonged, as evident during the softwood lumber dispute.</p>
<p>His positive outlook stems from how the NAFTA nations are pulling together to fight the ban of meat products from their farmers.</p>
<p>"The U. S. and Canada have worked co-operatively in registering our concerns and being aggressive with countries that want to put a ban on our products.</p>
<p>"So it shows we can operate with a good level of understanding," Mr. Day said. "But we have our differences."</p>
<p>As per the meat-labelling issue, he added, "we believe it is important to go into structured process of discussion, where both sides can make their case clearly at the table, and hopefully get a resolution."</p>
<p>A prominent trade expert said a deal could indeed be struck.</p>
<p>"It may be possible to find some kind of solution," said Lawrence Herman, trade lawyer at Cassels Brock in Toronto. "There have been discussions in trying to sort things out."</p>
<p>The labelling law has been years in the making, and Ottawa believed it had reached a resolution with the former Bush administration.</p>
<p>Mr. Herman said Canada's case is solid, as the labelling requirements put Canadian products at a disadvantage, which is not allowed under global trade rules. U. S. meat packers are said to be unwilling to buy Canadian livestock due to the additional paperwork the law entails.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Day said Canada is willing to take "appropriate steps" against countries that have banned Canadian pork as a result of the spread of the H1N1 virus. "There is no scientific basis for countries to ban Canadian pork products and we will be challenging on that very point."</p>
<p>Several countries, including China and Russia, have imposed either full or partial bans on pork and live swine imports from the NAFTA countries.</p>

<p>Re: 'Without a Christian experience, evolutionists are just speculating' (Letters, May 6)</p>
<p>If you want proof that evolution exists, you need only to look at the newspaper to see what havoc the new swine flu virus has wreaked on the world.</p>
<p>The influenza virus has mutated and is mutating constantly. Also look at bacteria, some of which have evolved to be drug-resistant so that the antibiotics we have depended on for the past 60 years are almost useless.</p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that humans existed more than 20,000 years ago, but apart from the Bible, where is the evidence that the world was created in seven days, 5,000 years ago?</p>

<p>Hamilton's public health department spent more than $110,000 last week fighting swine flu.</p>
<p>There are no cases in Hamilton yet, but public health is diverting dozens of staff from other programs to work on the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>By the end of last week, 100 staff had worked on swine flu including about three dozen full time. They logged 1,867 hours on H1N1 in one week. It's affecting other public health programs and raised the possibility of cuts because there is no money set aside in the budget for dealing with an illness like this.</p>
<p>"We've had to slow down some other services," said Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health. "We're certainly taking staff off other activities and putting them on this."</p>
<p>He said it's worth the cost despite swine flu being mild in Ontario so far. "We don't know for sure what the impact will be," Mackie said.</p>
<p>He points out that Ontario's central lab is backed up with about 900 samples waiting to be tested, making it difficult to determine how the virus is spreading.</p>
<p>"It is important for us to be vigilant," he said. "We need to know exactly what's happening in our community in order to be able to predict what happens next or if this comes back in the fall in a more serious way, what we might see then."</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases continued to rise in Ontario, with the total climbing to 56 yesterday.</p>
<p>Two of the cases are Halton students, both recovering at home.</p>
<p>One is from Lorne Skuce public elementary school in Oakville. Letters went out to parents this week urging students with symptoms to stay home.</p>
<p>"People are obviously concerned," said principal Bob Hewson. "We're putting everything in place to minimize what is going on with students and staff and working through the recommendations of public health."</p>
<p>The other is a teen from Christ the King Catholic Secondary School in Georgetown.</p>
<p>The students appear to have no connection to each other or to Mexico, where the flu started.</p>
<p>Halton's public health department is also diverting resources to swine flu, with about two dozen staff working on H1N1, including 15 full time. Medical officer of health Bob Nosal is spending about 95 per cent of his time on swine flu.</p>
<p>There have been questions about whether too many resources are going into swine flu considering that so far it has affected far fewer people than seasonal influenza, which hits 10 to 25 per cent of Canadians. About 20,000 people are hospitalized in Canada each year and 4,000 die.</p>
<p>But Nosal said there is far too many unknowns about this virus for public health to let its guard down yet. "We don't know attack rates, transmissibility and we don't even know incubation period right now," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WHO changes tune, now says pork safe to eat; Industry Still Reeling</b>
</div><div>Emily Senger   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>627 words</div><div>8 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Pork is safe to eat, the World Health Organization said yesterday, but this reassurance did little for Canadian pork producers, who say the swine flu virus is the latest blow to an already battered industry.</p>
<p>Keiji Fukuda, acting WHO assistant director-general, told reporters at a daily news conference in Geneva yesterday that eating pork is safe.</p>
<p>"Eating pork does not pose a risk to people in terms getting this infection," Mr. Fukuda said.</p>
<p>That statement comes the day after Jorgen Schlundt, director of the WHO Depatment of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Food Borne Diseases, said pork from animals infected with swine flu should not be consumed by humans. He later clarified his statement, saying that properly processed pork is safe.</p>
<p>The muddled messages do not change the situation for pork producers in Canada, which is the worst Jurgen Preugschas, 60, has seen in his lifetime as a hog producer.</p>
<p>"We've had just a multitude of shocks, one after the other," said Mr. Preugschas, who is the chair of the Canadian Pork Council and also raises about 9,000 hogs on his farm near Mayerthorpe, Alta., northwest of Edmonton.</p>
<p>In early 2000, the Canadian hog industry used to be profitable.</p>
<p>"With the low Canadian dollar it was easy to compete on the world market," Mr. Preugschas said. "We sold at a low price around the world. We ended up being a low-cost seller for a high-value product."</p>
<p>Then the U. S. dollar collapsed. Input costs for commodities like food and fuel rose.</p>
<p>Hog producers have lost money consistently since the fall of 2006, Mr. Preugschas said.</p>
<p>Currently, hog producers are selling their animals for about 40 cents per kilogram lower than expected, which means they lose close to $40 on each animal they sell, Mr. Preugschas said.</p>
<p>Many have quit altogether. The industry has lost 28% of its producers since 2006.</p>
<p>Swine flu means even more hog producers will leave the business in the next 12 months, said Karl Kynoch, who is the chair of the Manitoba Pork Council and raises his own hogs near the town of Baldur, southwest of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>"This will make the difference of whether some producers lose their farms, or go into bankruptcy, or finally just give up," Mr. Kynoch said. "We get a lot of producer calls where they just don't know what to do."</p>
<p>Before swine flu sent prices plummeting, things were starting to look up in Manitoba, where 900 hog farmers contribute about $2 billion annually to the provincial economy. Mr. Kynoch said Manitoba producers thought they might actually make a profit this summer for the first time in three years.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>"Right now, what's going to happen, nobody knows," Mr. Kynoch said.</p>
<p>Ken McEwan, an agricultural economics professor at the University of Guelph Ridgetown Campus, said the hog market actually showed signs of an upswing in mid-April, until swine flu sent hog prices plummetting again.</p>
<p>While China, Russia and at least a dozen other countries have banned or restricted pork imports, Mr. Mc-Ewan said Canadian consumers are likely to rally around the pork industry, as they did in 2003 when bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better know as BSE or mad cow disease, devastated Canadian beef ranchers.</p>
<p>"Any time when there is a potential pandemic, and it has the swine flu attached to it, and you're a pork producer, it raises a concern with consumer confidence," Mr. McEwan said. "When BSE broke out in Western Canada, there was a concerted effort and Canadians actually ate more beef. It's hopeful that Canadians here, now, will respond in the same way."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine No. 1 priority - Race on to be ready in case second wave strikes in fall</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt   </div>
<div>595 words</div><div>8 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>THE rush is on to develop a vaccine for H1N1 influenza at Winnipeg's microbiology lab over growing concern that a second, deadlier wave of illness will strike this fall.</p>
<p>Mexican officials have said the outbreak is fizzling out as the number of new confirmed flu cases declines, but disease experts say the pandemic scare could be far from over.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director of the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab, said new influenza viruses that surface this time of year tend to sputter out, before they start spreading in the southern hemisphere in late spring and summer.</p>
<p>Historic flu patterns show these viruses tend to resurface in fall -- including some strains that mutate and become more severe.</p>
<p>The threat has left local scientists scrambling to develop a vaccine "seed" in record time. A vaccine usually takes about six months to develop, but Plummer expects the seed will be ready in the next few weeks -- a sign that the H1N1 vaccine will be ready to be rolled out in time for annual flu season.</p>
<p>To date, Mexico has reported the bulk of severe cases of H1N1, also known as swine flu, of any country worldwide. Of the 214 confirmed cases across Canada, only one girl in Alberta reported a severe illness.</p>
<p>A Brandon girl is recovering from a mild case of human swine flu, and no new cases were reported in Manitoba on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We have to be prepared for the event it may come back for our flu season in the fall," Plummer said at the Arlington Street lab on Thursday. "We hope that doesn't happen but we have to be ready for it."</p>
<p>"It's an urgent situation; it will be a rush."</p>
<p>Plummer said influenza viruses can mutate rapidly, and scientists have no idea whether the current strain will resurface or morph into a deadlier virus. Changes in influenza viruses are difficult to predict, but Plummer said he thinks the pending vaccine will protect against the current strain and any small changes.</p>
<p>"We don't know yet -- there's a chance it could be stronger," Plummer said, referring to what a second wave of H1N1 might look like. "These viruses mutate a lot."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some scientists outside Canada are scoffing at the federal government's claim that its research lab in Winnipeg was the first to fully decode the swine flu virus. A scientist at a European lab, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Canadian Press it's widely accepted the U.S. was first to decode the virus.</p>

<p>Placing Canadian university students in quarantine over misplaced concerns about swine flu was certainly an inappropriate and unfair exercise of public-health powers by Chinese officials (China Overreacts – May 6). However, the intended contrast to the use of quarantine in Toronto during the SARS crisis in 2003 is not appropriate. Toronto quarantined about 30,000 people; the only other city that quarantined a comparable number was Beijing, with a population of 18 million and the majority of SARS cases worldwide.</p>
<p>The WHO subsequently concluded that quarantine played no appreciable role in ending the SARS crisis.</p>
<p>The costs of quarantine are not “relatively minor” but involve the deprivation of fundamental liberties without due process and divert public-health resources that could be better utilized to directly address those who are actually sick. Arbitrary quarantine decisions were wrong then, they are wrong now.</p>

<p>CALGARY, TORONTO -- The carpenter at the centre of a virulent new strain of flu on an Alberta pig farm said he didn't think twice about showing up to work sick, hardly expecting that the virus he might have brought home from Mexico would soon “wreck” the pork industry.</p>
<p>Still, Adrian Blaak, 54, of Rocky Mountain House, who was in Mexicali, the capital of the Mexican state of Baja California, from April 1-12 helping build two churches, isn't sure he's to blame for infecting one quarter of the 2,020 pigs belonging to a producer in his area with the A/H1N1 virus. The producer has not been publicly identified.</p>
<p>“What can you do? Everybody goes to work sick. I'm sure you've gone to work with the flu before,” Mr. Blaak said yesterday.</p>
<p>Two days after he returned from travelling to Mexico as part of the congregation of Rocky Mountain House Covenant, a Christian Reform Church in his central Alberta hometown, Mr. Blaak felt a bit under the weather, but he went ahead with a contract to change some vents at a local pig barn. He said he worked in an area above the pigs and never touched them.</p>
<p>But he felt terrible later that night.</p>
<p>He stayed home for a week toughing out the cough and fever in bed. He sought medical attention on April 24, after reports of the A/H1N1 flu emerged, even though he no longer felt sick.</p>
<p>“I got tested twice for it and both tests came back negative,” Mr. Blaak said.</p>
<p>Frank Plummer, scientific director of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said yesterday that the tests done on Mr. Blaak were negative for the virus. But the testing was done after he recovered, Dr. Plummer said, adding that scientists will look for antibodies in a serum sample.</p>
<p>Other workers on the farm also tested negative for the new virus, Dr. Plummer said.</p>
<p>Mr. Blaak said he believes officials have jumped to conclusions and the illness has been blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>“They kind of wreck an industry,” he said.</p>
<p>Pork prices have fallen since the outbreak among the pigs at the farm, the first case of human-to-swine transmission of the virus. The infected pigs recovered, but the farm remains quarantined. Ottawa said a mass slaughter is not necessary.</p>
<p>Albert Van Der Meer, who has a hog farm north of Rocky Mountain House and is friends with the pigs' owner, said a cull has already begun as piglets born under quarantine are creating cramped quarters in the sealed off barns. “It's pretty tough on [the farmer]. It's just a family with young kids,” Mr. Van Der Meer said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Saskatchewan became the latest province to record cases of A/H1N1 as the World Health Organization warned that as many as two billion people could be infected if the current outbreak turns into a pandemic.</p>
<p>Keiji Fukuda, acting assistant director-general for health security and environment, said previous pandemics have shown that one-third of the world's population gets infected and the outbreak lasts roughly two years.</p>
<p>“If this situation continues to evolve, if the viruses do become established in multiple countries outside of North America, if we do move into a pandemic, then our expectation is that we will see a large number of people infected worldwide,” Dr. Fukuda said. He said it's “premature” to predict the death rate.</p>
<p>The world has changed since past pandemics, he added, and experts are unable to predict the impact.</p>
<p>A northern Alberta community was expressing concern last night over a woman who died recently who had been in contact with a relative who had a confirmed case of the H1N1 virus. The woman who died did not have a confirmed case. Alberta Health refused to comment.</p>
<p>The number of cases in Canada climbed yesterday to 214, with new mild cases in Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and two in Saskatchewan.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>In final stretch ‘every vote is going to count'; Advance polls show high turnout; NDP fights to fend off attacks from business community</b>
</div><div>JUSTINE HUNTER   </div>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- As the leaders' tours enter the final stretch this weekend with a blitz across the province, the Liberals and New Democrats have revved up their “get out the vote” efforts early, with advance polls showing heavy turnout this week.</p>
<p>NDP Leader Carole James's tour bus was set to roll before sunrise today for an 18-hour haul through at least 15 ridings. “It's going to be competitive,” she told reporters yesterday. “It really will be one of those elections where every vote is going to count.”</p>
<p>Almost 84,000 voters cast their ballots on the first day of advance polling this week. By comparison, fewer than 55,000 voters turned out in 2005 on the first day of advance polls.</p>
<p>It's a noteworthy turnout in a campaign where voters have appeared distracted by competing issues like the swine flu and the Vancouver Canucks' progress in the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
<p>As they prepare for Tuesday's vote, Ms. James and Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell will aim to capture voters' attention with a flurry of whistle stops in swing ridings like Kamloops and in battlegrounds like Burnaby and Surrey.</p>
<p>At the same time, their allies are stepping up to help push their team over the top: CEOs who rarely make public forays into the political realm are escalating attacks on the NDP, while competing interests are offering fresh ammunition to help the New Democrats.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell seemed to cue the business community last Sunday during the televised leaders debate, when he noted that the NDP has yet to win a business endorsement from any major sector of the economy. In the ensuing days, business leaders stepped up to confirm fears that an NDP government would drive out investment and kill jobs.</p>
<p>The latest business sector to join the anti-NDP clamour yesterday was B.C.'s Clean Tech CEO Alliance.</p>
<p>Jonathan Burke of Westport Innovations said in an interview that the NDP's plan to axe the carbon tax would give the province an international black eye and would discourage investment in the fast-growing sector that generates $1-billion in economic activity in B.C.</p>
<p>“British Columbians should know, green-collar jobs are at stake in this election,” he said. Mr. Burke would not say his company has plans to pack up and leave B.C., but he noted that the firm has been courted to move to other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Other sectors yesterday weighed in on the NDP's behalf. The BC Citizens for Public Power, representing more than 50 grassroots organizations, sided with the party in calling for a moratorium on private power projects. And the Lower Mainland Local Government Association passed a resolution calling for a higher minimum wage. Ms. James has said her party would raise it from $8 an hour to $10, while the Liberals argue an increase would kill jobs.</p>
<p>Ms. James took her campaign to a busy Vancouver SkyTrain station and later ventured into the Downtown Eastside. Although she has talked about homelessness throughout the campaign, the event in the epicentre of the country's poorest neighbourhood had nothing to do with the people lying on the streets nearby. Instead, she spoke inside the Firehall Arts Centre, where she pledged that her government would boost funding for the arts.</p>
<p>“It's a smart investment in tough economic times,” she said, estimating that a tax dollar invested in culture will be paid back “tenfold.”</p>
<p>Her party's arts critic, Spencer Herbert, was more modest in his estimate. He told the crowd that every dollar invested in cultural events would return $1.36 in tax money. “It's not a frill,” he said.</p>
<p>Ms. James later told reporters she believes her party is gaining ground by the day in its bid to end eight years of Liberal government. She said she won't change her approach in the final days of the campaign: “It's continuing to show people that I have a balanced approach, that we have an approach that ensures we have a strong economy and strong, healthy safe communities – that's what the public is looking for.”</p>

</p>
<p>Our apologies, but about the pachyderm in the living room...</p>
<p>The Phoenix Coyotes declare bankruptcy, a legal faceoff ensues between the team's owner and the NHL and an entire country (hint: not the one where the Coyotes are located) debates where the team will/should be relocated.</p>
<p>In this cacophony of white noise, of course, Winnipeg is an afterthought. After all, when it comes to the NHL and the denizens of Toronto, this city, as it relates to the league, will always be something less than ideal. It's reality, folks. Deal with it.</p>
<p>But while those all around the raging debate can ignore it, the fact remains that the Coyotes didn't just appear in the desert out of thin, dry air. They were once the Winnipeg Jets, the home of greats like Anders and Bobby, Dale and Teemu.</p>
<p>Go ahead, you remember. Even by their first names.</p>
<p>Yet we can't really bring that up now can we, or risk being frowned upon by those who mistakenly believe that any mention of the Coyotes' current financial morass is to somehow suggest even indirectly that an NHL team in this city might arise from the ashes in Phoenix.</p>
<p>That's the rub in Winnipeg, you see. This is the town the NHL spurned. This is the place where the loss of the Jets created a myriad of mixed and entrenched emotions.</p>
<p>Trust me, they can openly discuss the possibility of the NHL relocating anywhere; Kansas City, Hamilton, Las Vegas, Seattle, Houston. Even freaking Aruba. Anywhere else, and there's not so much as a sniff of objection or -- in the case of all the aforementioned locations but Hamilton -- simple need.</p>
<p>There's nary a mention that the NHL has been to Kansas City before, and failed miserably. Rarely an indication that Las Vegas, in the midst of a catastrophic economic depression, might not be a hockey town. Or that Houston and Seattle, correct us if we're wrong, have ever shown so much as a passing interest in the game.</p>
<p>That's the irony. If there's no passion, there's no heartbreak, no loss. No want.</p>
<p>Question: The Coyotes have declared bankruptcy, right? The team's very future is in peril. In sizing up the situation last week, Arizona Republic columnist Dan Bickley opined: "What if they (the Coyotes) were closer? What if they were better? What if they had actually won a playoff series over the past 22 years? Regrets, yes. But would you miss them?"</p>
<p>In the home of the NFL's Cardinals, the NBA's Suns, MLB's Diamondbacks and big-time NCAA football, let's assume the last question was rhetorical.</p>
<p>That's the luxury, in a perverse way, of such markets. There's no guilt. No shame. No sense of civic failure if an NHL team leaves you for another and never looks back. Must be nice.</p>
<p>You see, we've got baggage in Winnipeg. Bad memories and open wounds aplenty. Go ahead, just try to suggest that a Canadian city of 650,000 in a relatively robust economy with a new 15,000-seat arena -- checkered history and all -- might be a more suitable NHL location than, say, a struggling casino city in Nevada. See how long it takes before the word, 'Idiot' comes up.</p>
<p>It's understandable. Given the Jets' heart-wrenching departure, there's a built-in gag reflex to dismiss loose talk of the NHL returning as naive at best, and reckless at worst.</p>
<p>And it's not just about emotion, either. During the last provincial election, Conservative leader Hugh McFadyen made the mistake of declaring, if elected premier, he would aggressively pursue the return of the NHL to Manitoba. No promise of government money. No guarantees. Yet judging by the harsh and swift negative reaction, McFadyen might has well have presented a platform to aggressively pursuing the return of the swine flu.</p>
<p>Yeah, we've got baggage, alright. We stink of failed ambitions. We wear the spurning of the NHL like an ill-fitting leisure suit. In fact, maybe our worst fear is that this city might, shudder, once again be considered as an NHL location and come up wanting.</p>
<p>So just don't bring it up, please. Don't remind us of those nights where the Jets drew 9,000. What's the point in stirring sad memories of Barry Shenkarow pleading for arena money or the millions of dollars the taxpayers had to cover in Jets' unpaid bills. The tearful demonstration at the Forks? Don't even go there.</p>
<p>Sure, we've got an arena with twice as many seats as the Coyotes draw most nights. But why kid yourself. You know we can't afford that league. Worse, can you imagine the consequences of trying and failing again?</p>
<p>So talk about the NHL moving to that new building waiting in Kansas City. Talk about a franchise in that invisible arena in Vegas. Talk about Hamilton. At least they're Canadian, too.</p>
<p>Anywhere but here, we beg you. We've been through enough already.</p>
<p>The NHL in Houston? Hey, why not? Texas is a big place. It could work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the city still haunted by the ghost of the Jets, an elephant turns like a sleepy dog and settles down in the living room. And sighs.</p>
<p>The baggage stored safely away in his trunk.</p>

<p>DEAR RHONA: Like many other people I am disturbed and anxious about the swine flu. I am having trouble sleeping and find myself avoiding social contact with friends. I know some of my fears are probably groundless but I have cancelled a first date with a man I talked to on the phone because he sounded nasal. Am I the only one who would rather be safe than sorry?</p>
<p>-- Staying Home</p>
<p>Dear SH: Yup, if your plan is to stay at home and lock the doors you're more likely to avoid the flu. You are also more likely to get overweight, lonely and work yourself into a frothy despondent mess. There are common sense precautions to take and perhaps avoiding vacations in hot zones makes sense, but passing up on human contact is no way to live. You can't experience life from inside a human size gerbil ball. I'd guess that you have some other anxiety issues and this concern is just one of many. Don't obsess -- keep in mind that incessant 24 hour news reporting and instant access to information batters our minds into exhaustion. I'd hate to think this is the end of the era of handshakes and hugs. A certain amount of worry is normal but if you are fixated on illness and death perhaps you should nix the news and plug into a (germ-free) counsellor.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A plum role; So what if Bruce Greenwood had to endure Romulan torture for it?</b>
</div><div>Linda Barnard   </div>
<div>Movies Editor</div>
<div>1408 words</div><div>8 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood was working in Toronto when he got the call that has launched his already successful career into a new orbit.</p>
<p>It was director J.J. Abrams on the line and he was offering Greenwood a pivotal part in his new Star Trek project as Capt. Christopher Pike, the officer originally at the helm of the USS Enterprise, who encourages a young hotshot named James T. Kirk to realize his true potential.</p>
<p>"I couldn't believe it," says Greenwood, who was born in Noranda, Que. "I had no idea he knew I even existed."</p>
<p>It's hardly unbelievable that Abrams wouldn't know Greenwood's work. Since his breakout big-screen role as Ashley Judd's duplicitous husband in Double Jeopardy in 1999, he has gone on to play a president twice: as JFK in Thirteen Days and a fictional commander-in-chief in National Treasure: Book of Secrets. He's also done a host of memorable evil-guy roles, including in I, Robot and starred in the critically lauded cable series John From Cincinnati as the patriarch of a California surfing family.</p>
<p>"He (Abrams) said 'Do you wanna be in this movie, and I said, 'well, probably! Can you send me a script?' And he said no. He said 'the only way for you to do it is to come back to L.A. and we'll put you in a secure environment. We'll lock a room and you can read the script and tell me what you think.'"</p>
<p>Greenwood laughs as he tells the story of the security-conscious Abrams during an interview with the Toronto Star in a Yorkville hotel suite this week. The 52-year-old actor is easygoing and funny, and happily mugs for the Star's photographer with a variety of props the actor finds in the hotel room, grinning as he hauls a chair onto the mattress when he is asked if he will sit on the bed.</p>
<p>"This is for swine flu," he quips as he pulls back his leather jacket to reveal a vintage Pink Floyd pig T-shirt. The wrinkles around his ice-blue eyes deepen when he smiles, testament to his years, but not diminishing the fact this is one very handsome man.</p>
<p>Shut in that Los Angeles room to read the script, Greenwood soon realized that he was being offered a sizeable role in Pike, a very minor player in the original TV series who meets an unsavoury end.</p>
<p>"I read it and really loved it," says Greenwood. "It's a good role."</p>
<p>"On the page I can tell if the story is strong, but the execution of course is still a mystery. You can never tell if a good script is going to make a good movie."</p>
<p>He likens it to when he read the script for Little Miss Sunshine. He was being considered for the role that eventually went to Steve Carell in the indie smash about a dysfunctional family.</p>
<p>"I said, this is impossible to do wrong. This script is so great," he recalled of Little Miss Sunshine. "And they made it better than I thought it would be."</p>
<p>Star Trek make the leap from page to sound stage with similar success, says Greenwood, and he credits Abrams with that.</p>
<p>"On the set with J.J. is so incredibly energetic and so inclusive, and extremely funny," he says. "I don't know if he has this ability endlessly, or if this is in every production he's involved with, but with this one, the group of people he put together were instantly compatible. Everybody got along really well."</p>
<p>Greenwood was impressed with the rest of the cast, whose members include Chris Pine and Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Eric Bana as the evil outlaw Romulan, Nero.</p>
<p>"Really solid cast! The actors were good," Greenwood adds. "But often you put a bunch of good actors together and they're not necessarily inclined to sit around a table all day and trace their words and have fun. And we did. We really hung out and played music, it was really a blessing."</p>
<p>Greenwood is an accomplished guitarist, singer and producer. He's also had a background typical of actors; he moved around a lot as a kid and young man, working on an oil rig in Alberta and as a diamond driller in the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>He ended up in L.A. when he decided to try acting, but often spends time in Vancouver, the city where he grew up. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Susan - they met when they were both 15 and wed more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Greenwood's younger years didn't include the cultish devotion to Star Trek many kids growing up the late '60s embraced when the show was on the air from 1966-69. Was he a fan?</p>
<p>"No, not enough that I carved a phaser out of a toothbrush," Greenwood chuckles. "I was more into pirates. I carved a lot of swords."</p>
<p>Still he appreciates what this movie means to fans, especially those who have been with the series since the beginning.</p>
<p>"Even people who didn't watch it religiously were formed by it," he says. "I may have seen 20 episodes in pieces. Of course, what I watched it for was the girls in the tight outfits and to try to figure out what was real and what wasn't. Was that rock a fake rock or not?"</p>
<p>But he must have had a favourite character. Who did he most want to be?</p>
<p>"It's funny, I might have been asked every question and I've done over 100 interviews, so take a bow," he says with a smile, admitting nobody has asked him this one before. "I would have to say Kirk. I suppose as a kid I wanted to be a hero."</p>
<p>Fair-weather fan or not, Greenwood still felt a thrill when he walked onto the set of the bridge for the first time.</p>
<p>"The thing that struck me was the ergonomics. How functional everything was," he muses. "It just felt like it was a working environment. There was the right number of people for the space and it evoked the bridge of the old Enterprise, and in many ways it felt tremendously real.</p>
<p>"The thing that struck me walking onto the bridge for the first time - no one was touching the captain's chair. It's just a set, right? People are festooned all around, perched on every available surface.

<p>Greenwood says his role didn't call for much action work - unlike Pine who uses his fists as much as his smarts.

<p>"It was a couple of days of extreme discomfort," says Greenwood, who pushed Abrams not to cut the scene early, but let Nero actually finish the job on camera. "It was hideous. It worked, though," says Greenwood with a grin.</p>
<p>He's also proud the film includes so many gifts to fans in the way of inside jokes and visual puns.</p>
<p>"The movie is full of what are being referred to as Easter eggs. The movie is beautifully designed to respect those long-time fans and the things that they loved about Star Trek from the very beginning."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>What you can do to avoid getting the flu</b>
</div><div>573 words</div><div>8 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>L03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The number of deaths attributed to swine flu may be climbing. Anxiety about it is climbing even faster.</p>
<p>But you can do more than be worried. Here's what we are doing and what you should, too:</p>
<p>1. Accept the control you have (and don't). You cannot control who gets this flu, how severe it is and where it will spread. Stress weakens your immune system, making you more susceptible to any bug.</p>
<p>2. Wash your hands! Wash your hands if you shake someone else's. Wash your hands before and after touching anything.</p>
<p>3. Avoid people who are coughing.</p>
<p>4. Be smart about crowds and planes. Avoid 'em if you can.</p>
<p>5. Keep your immunity up. Get seven and a half to eight hours of sleep a night. Avoid more than one drink of alcohol a day. Take a multivitamin with 1,000 IU of vitamin D-3 every day.</p>
<p>6. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. And use it! Your hands aren't the only things that pick up germs. Ladies, do you know where the bottom of your handbag has been?</p>
<p>7. Wash your hands. Did we say that already?</p>
<p>Fruit loop: How many fruits and vegetables did you eat today? Yesterday? Thought so. Most people don't get enough produce, even though getting more is an easy way to make yourself look, feel and be sexier. Not worried about being sexier? Then choose it because it makes your immune system and arteries younger: Produce keeps your blood pressure, your lousy cholesterol and your risk of heart disease and cancer low. Yes, fruits and veggies increase your libido and are just cool for your body.</p>
<p>Some easy choices: Think raisins. Sugar snap peas. Edamame. Even broccoli, cauliflower, apples, bananas and dried kiwifruit. Just buy it, wash it, pack it and down it.</p>
<p>The pursuit of happiness: You know that guy who is always up? He could have just been just fired, but he sees the positive in it? Well, hang with him. Doesn't matter whether you meet people like that for a walk in the morning or a glass of wine at night, or just pick up the phone and reach out. Happy friends benefit your mental health: Your chances of being happy increase by at least 15 per cent if someone in your immediate social circle is happy.</p>
<p>Happiness seems to be contagious: If a friend who lives within a mile of you becomes happy, the probability that you'll feel it, too, goes up by 25 per cent. And man, does that guy have a long arm: The happiness of a friend of a friend may push your mood up, too.</p>
<p>Fill 'er up: Want more from your first meal of the day than a way to keep your stomach from growling through your 8 a.m. meeting? Adding certain foods to your plate, bowl or baggie can lower your blood pressure (and jump-start your metabolism and get you out the door so quickly that it looks like you got up on time). Here's how:</p>
<p>Sprinkle flaxseed on your cereal.</p>
<p>Stir chopped walnuts into oatmeal.</p>
<p>Whip berries into your smoothie.</p>
<p>Toss a tomato onto your egg-white omelette.</p>
<p>Grab a yogurt.</p>

<p>Deliberately exposing yourself to the flu is a dangerous game that could seriously harm yourself and others, says Dr. Michael Finkelstein, associate medical officer of health for Toronto.</p>
<p>"It's important to note the flu can make you very sick," says Finkelstein, adding, "On-purpose exposure doesn't seem a wise thing to do."</p>
<p>He was commenting on a report that suggested people should just get the flu now so they can avoid the tougher strains to come later.</p>
<p>Flu strains mutate quickly, says Finkelstein, so having one strain gives you no immunity against another that can come raging through a population.</p>
<p>And you can get the flu more than once, he notes.</p>
<p>Also, you can be symptom-free for days while still being able to infect those around you, especially the frail elderly, the very young and those with health conditions such as diabetes, cancer and lung disease.</p>
<p>"You can spread it before you know you are unwell," he says.</p>
<p>The question of deliberate exposure to flu arose from parents who had done this previously with chicken pox. Unlike chicken pox, which is very stable and for which a vaccine is highly effective, Finkelstein says the flu is a volatile virus.</p>
<p>And, just because some people have not become very ill from H1N1 doesn't mean it wouldn't throw you for a loop, he says.</p>
<p>This flu "is something we don't know much about. But it can make people very seriously ill."</p>

</p>
<p>The United States, Canada and Mexico vowed yesterday to fight what they called unjustified bans on pork products in the wake of a H1N1 flu outbreak that started in Mexico.</p>
<p>Twenty or more countries - most notably Russia and China - have imposed widespread import restrictions on pork and pork products from major U.S., Canadian and Mexican agricultural regions, amid fears over the disease, originally called swine flu. Experts say the flu is spread though the air and is not food-borne. The World Health Organization reiterated yesterday that eating pork is "not a danger in terms of getting this infection" and normal sanitary and health precautions were enough to safeguard the food supply.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the three NAFTA countries called for an end to "unscientific bans on pork imports" over the outbreak.</p>

</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- The United States is in the midst of a devastating recession, mired in two overseas wars and grappling with a swine flu outbreak, but conservative critics are assailing President Barack Obama on another pressing issue: his choice of burger topping.</p>
<p>Dijongate is in full force, with Fox News and a conservative blogger leading the charge against the president for his choice of the apparently un-American mustard atop his cheeseburger.</p>
<p>During an impromptu lunch stop earlier this week with Vice-President Joe Biden, Obama asked for Dijon at Ray's Hell Burger in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p>There's no evidence of wiretapped hotel rooms or a Deep Throat lurking in the shadows, but there are accusations of a cover-up - MSNBC, apparently, edited out the president's request for Dijon in order to help Obama maintain his "man of the people" street cred.</p>
<p>Fox's Sean Hannity has been telling his viewers that MSNBC - and reporter Andrea Mitchell - are trying to hide Obama's Dijon-loving ways from the public. Hannity has been referring to the president's lunch as his "fancy burger."</p>
<p>Blogger William Jacobson, a Cornell law school professor, noted Dijon on a Hell Burger had "a very John Kerry-ish quality about it."</p>
<p>It all hearkens back to those silly days of "freedom fries," the name given to French fries by hawkish conservatives in 2003 when France expressed strong opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.</p>

</p>
<p>Health officials are testing a deceased patient from northern Alberta for swine influenza, sources told Canwest News Service last night.</p>
<p>Results from the tests were not yet available, but if the patient did havethe influenza strain, it would be the first time someone with the disease has died in Canada. Media reports suggested the patient was an elderly woman. Jim Meagher of Alberta Health's emergency operations centre said yesterday that an elderly woman did die in northern Alberta and that tests were underway to determine the cause of death. But Mr. Meagher did not say whether she was being tested for the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>Canada has confirmed 214 cases of swine flu, but so far the virus has mostly been causing mild illness in patients.</p>
<p>Only one confirmed patient --a young girl from Edmonton -- has developed more serious illness from the virus. The girl is recovering in hospital.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the World Health Organization raised its global totals to 2,371 lab-confirmed cases of swine flu, including 44 deaths -- 42 in Mexico and two in the U. S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pork is safe to eat, the World Health Organization said yesterday, but this reassurance did little for Canadian pork producers, who say the swine flu virus is the latest blow to an already battered industry. Keiji Fukuda, acting WHO assistant director-general, told reporters at a daily news conference in Geneva yesterday that eating pork is safe.</p>
<p>That statement comes the day after Jorgen Schlundt, director of the WHO Depatment of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Food Borne Diseases, said pork from animals infected with swine flu should not be consumed by humans. He later clarified his statement, saying that properly processed pork is safe.</p>
<p>The muddled messages do not change the situation for pork producers in Canada, which is the worst Jurgen Preugschas, 60, has seen in his lifetime as a hog producer.</p>

<p>There is never a shortage of players willing to don any manner of jersey in order to chase the diamond dream.</p>
<p>Last year they were Reno Silver Sox, Windy City Thunderbolts, Lewisville Lizzards, Long Island Ducks, Samurai Bears and Winnipeg Goldeyes. This year, they want to be Victoria Seals.</p>
<p>The Seals of the professional Golden Baseball League open their inaugural spring training camp in franchise history today in Yuma, Ariz., with 35 players invited. The GBL is among seven North American independent minor-pro baseball leagues.</p>
<p>Some GBL teams have gone the veteran route. Pitcher and two-time New York Yankees World Series champion Hideki Irabu and former National League all-star hurler Jose Lima have signed with the Long Beach Armada, 11-season major-leaguer Damian Jackson and former American League all-star Robert Fick with the Orange County Flyers, World Series-champion former Anaheim Angel Louis Pote with the Edmonton Capitals and former major-league closer Mac Suzuki with the Calgary Vipers.</p>
<p>The Seals, however, are opting for a team of young prospects.</p>
<p>Four players under contract to major league clubs last season -- catcher Josh Tarnow from the Baltimore Orioles minor-pro system, outfielders Juan Senreiso from the Washington Nationals and Sergio Pedroza from the Tampa Bay chains and pitcher Chris Bodishbaugh from the Florida Marlins system -- are the prize signings in Seals camp. Local content is provided by pitchers Graham Campbell of Victoria and Mason Scott of Saltspring Island and first basemen Evan Romanchuk of North Vancouver. Eleven of the camp invitees were in the GBL last season.</p>
<p>"You've got hunger and you've got enthusiasm out there," said Victoria field boss Darrell Evans, a World Series champion and career 400-plus home run hitter in the majors.</p>
<p>"Everybody out here wants to play the game. But it's what you do on the field that matters. Some of these younger kids out of college will find this a higher calibre than they have ever played in before."</p>
<p>The Seals are holding training camp in Yuma for logistical purposes -- most of the Seals players will be Americans and spring weather in Canada can be iffy. The Victoria club is sharing 10,000-seat Desert Sun Stadium and adjacent Ray Kroc Complex with the hometown Yuma Scorpions of the GBL and will play several scrimmage games against the Scorpions before breaking camp May 17 and heading to Royal Athletic Park for the first home-field practice May 20. The Seals fly to Edmonton the next day to open the regular season May 21 against the Capitals at Telus Field. The home opener at Royal Athletic is May 29, the first game of a three-night stand against Irabu, Lima and the Long Beach Armada.</p>
<p>"I'm bouncing around like a kid," admitted Seals president Darren Parker, whose family owns the</p>
<p>Victoria franchise.</p>
<p>"I met [Scorpions manager and former major-leaguer] Mike Marshall at the stadium today and that was exciting. It's a really fine set-up down here with great fields and nice, big club houses. It will help us get the most out of spring training."</p>
<p>GBL teams are allowed to carry 22 players during the season.</p>
<p>"That's the part you hate the most," said Parker. "Everybody is arriving here with high hopes of pursuing their pro careers. Pretty soon, some will have to be let go."</p>
<p>Field-boss Evans said he is looking for players capable of moving up through the pro ranks.</p>
<p>"The goal is to make them better players."</p>
<p>Evans said he believes in solid, basic baseball but with the added flash of a team capable of putting pressure on the opposition.</p>
<p>"I'm looking for guys who can run the bases and steal," he said.</p>
<p>"On defence, I believe it all starts with pitchers who can throw strikes. So, pressure on offence and solid defence, beginning on the mound, is a combination that wins. And the team that makes the least amount of mistakes is going to win every time."</p>
<p>Evans said it wasn't tough recruiting young pros to come out for a start-up organization.</p>
<p>"A lot of the guys had already heard about how nice Victoria is, so selling the city was the easy part," he said. "The players are excited about being part of a new pro team in town."</p>
<p>DIAMOND DUST: The H1N1 virus, otherwise known as swine flu, has claimed its first GBL victim. The Tijuana Potros have abandoned plans to play in the 2009 season because of health issues in Mexico. The move means the GBL will operate with nine teams for 2009. The Seals were scheduled to play the Potros six times -- in Tijuana July 21-23 and at Royal Athletic Aug. 24-26. Those are now open dates as the Seals' original 88-game schedule has been reduced to 82 games.</p>

<p>Tests for the swine-flu virus in students at a Metchosin elementary school have come back negative, health authorities said yesterday.</p>
<p>Hans Helgesen Elementary School was shut down Tuesday after an estimated 25 to 30 per cent of its 188 students were absent with fever, cough and nausea. The school is expected to reopen Monday.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Stanwick, the Vancouver Island Health Authority's chief medical health officer, confirmed tests results are negative for Influenza A. The H1N1 virus, or human swine flu virus, is a sub-type of Influenza A.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control will perform additional tests on the specimens for other viruses causing respiratory illness, said VIHA spokeswoman Shannon Marshall. The results are expected to be available some time next week.</p>
<p>Stanwick is advising parents to monitor their children for signs of illness and keep them home if they are sick.</p>

</div><div>Janet French   </div>

</p>
<p>A Saskatoon high school student is one of the first two people in Saskatchewan to test positive for swine flu.</p>
<p>Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools' director of education Bev Hanson confirmed Thursday the school division had received word from health officials that a teen girl who attends a division school is recovering from a mild case of the H1N1 virus, or swine flu.</p>
<p>Hanson said public health officials did not say what school the girl attends and did not provide her name, for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>The Catholic school division has seven high schools, all of which are within Saskatoon city limits.</p>
<p>"What this really tells us is for sure now we have confirmation that the H1N1 influenza virus is present in the community," Saskatoon Health Region deputy medical health officer Dr. Johnmark Opondo said Thursday.</p>
<p>The teen travelled to Mexico on a family holiday and returned to the province in mid-April, Opondo said. Near the end of April, she developed mild cough symptoms. A few days later, when she had a fever, she went to see a doctor, at which time the doctor ordered a test for swine flu.</p>
<p>"They were following our advice, and that's when the case was picked up and detected," Opondo said.</p>
<p>CASE REPORTED IN SOUTHERN SASK.</p>
<p>The girl, who did not need hospitalization, was sent home to stay in isolation for seven days, Opondo said. She has since recovered and is ready to return to school. There is no reason to believe the girl could have infected other people, Opondo said, because she stayed at home while sick.</p>
<p>Opondo said other family members were also sick, but he did not say whether they were tested for swine flu. Opondo also didn't know where in Mexico the family had travelled.</p>
<p>Dr. Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer, also announced Thursday a woman in her 20s from the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region recently returned from a vacation in Mexico with mild flu symptoms. She did not require hospitalization and has since recovered.</p>
<p>Opondo also cautioned the worst of the swine flu outbreak could be yet to come. If this strain of the virus is able to stick around until autumn and winter, when flu season hits, "that's when this issue will become really significant," he said.</p>
<p>Even if swine flu continues to circulate at a low level in Saskatchewan with mild symptoms, the strain could have "an additive effect" if it's in the mix with the typical strains of influenza A and B people battle every winter, Opondo said. "We're not out of the woods yet."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Catholic school division and Saskatoon Public Schools have written a joint letter home that will be given to students and their families today, Hanson said. The letter will explain a teenage girl has tested positive for the virus, that it was a mild case and that she recovered, Hanson said. The letter also reiterates that it's safe for children to attend school and that health officials are not yet at the point of recommending schools shut down.</p>
<p>SCHOOLS HAVE PROGRAMS IN EFFECT</p>
<p>Any sick kids should stay home, she said, and teachers will also send home any kids who come to school appearing ill.</p>
<p>The division will tell caretaking staff again to do extra cleaning of surfaces where germs can be spread, such as on doorknobs and in bathrooms. Hanson said the division has also told principals they must report any incidences of widespread illness in their schools.</p>
<p>At Saskatoon Public Schools, precautions that were already in place, such as extra cleaning, educating students about cough and sneeze etiquette and following the pandemic plan, are all continuing, spokesperson Bruce Cory said Thursday.</p>
<p>"Everything is business as usual," Cory said, including any travel plans for students. "We're just staying the course right now, because we haven't been advised any differently."</p>
<p>Schools in the Prairie Spirit school division and Horizon school division are also emphasizing to students that hand-washing, staying home if sick and standing back from people who are coughing will all help stop the spread of viruses like swine flu.</p>
<p>Neither division has cancelled any activities or trips, spokespeople said Thursday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health officials are testing a deceased patient from northern Alberta for swine influenza, sources said Thursday night.</p>
<p>Results from the tests were not yet available, but if the patient did have the influenza strain, it would be the first time someone with the disease has died in Canada. Media reports suggested the patient was an elderly woman.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the World Health organization raised its global totals to 2,371 lab-confirmed cases of swine flu, including 44 deaths -- 42 in Mexico and two in the U.S. Twenty-four countries have reported cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection. Canada's public health agency confirmed 13 new cases across the country Thursday, bringing the national total of confirmed cases to 214.</p>

<p>Two billion people -- or a third of the world's population -- will become infected if the H1N1 flu becomes a pandemic, the World Health Organization warned yesterday.</p>
<p>If the virus turns more virulent or becomes established in multiple countries outside North America, "if we do move into a pandemic, then our expectation is that we will see a large number of people infected worldwide," said the WHO's acting director-general, Dr. Keiji Fukuda.</p>
<p>Based on past pandemics, "it would be a reasonable estimate to say perhaps a third of the world's population would get infected with this virus," he said.</p>
<p>Still, Fukuda said, there is no evidence the virus is establishing the kind of community spread in other parts of the world as it has in North America. He said WHO's pandemic alert remains at phase five, on a scale of six.</p>
<p>"We remain at phase five. That has not changed. We continue to see human-to-human transmission, community-level transmission primarily in North America. We are not seeing it yet anywhere else."</p>
<p>WHO officials are waiting to see what happens as the southern hemisphere enters winter, when flu viruses typically thrive.</p>
<p>The organization yesterday raised its global totals to 2,371 lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 flu, including 44 deaths -- 42 in Mexico and two in the U.S. Twenty-four countries have reported cases of H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>Canada's public-health agency confirmed 13 new cases across the country yesterday, bringing the national total of confirmed cases to 214.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan confirmed its first two cases -- a teenager and a woman in her 20s. Both had travelled to Mexico and both cases are mild.</p>
<p>Alberta reported three new cases, two of them children, neither of whom had travelled to Mexico. Both children have mild symptoms, unlike the Edmonton-area girl who was hospitalized this week after being hit more severely with the illness. Doctors say she is improving, but there was no word yesterday on when they expected her to return home.</p>
<p>Ontario reported seven new cases of H1N1 flu, and Quebec one.</p>
<p>South of the border, the U.S. reported 1,823 probable and confirmed cases in 43 states.</p>

<p>A Regina woman and a Saskatoon teenager who both vacationed last month in Mexico are the first in the province to have confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu virus, health officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The Regina woman, in her twenties, and the Saskatoon teen, a high school student, have since fully recovered, said Dr. Moira McKinnon, the provincial chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>Both females experienced "mild" influenza symptoms and neither required hospitalization, reflecting the experience of almost all of the approximately 200 other cases recorded in Canada.</p>
<p>"There's a constant daily monitoring of the situation. The fact that we've got two cases actually won't change much," McKinnon said at a Regina news conference.</p>
<p>But McKinnon emphasized that although officials are preparing in case the virus turns into something severe, current cases are mild and "everybody can go around business as usual."</p>
<p>The woman in Regina was tested in late April after she returned from Mexico with flu symptoms, said Dr. Maurice Hennink, deputy medical health officer with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region. The results had to be confirmed at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg and Saskatchewan Health didn't receive the positive result until Thursday morning.</p>
<p>"The person self-isolated after being medically assessed and had the specimens taken and subsequently recovered," said Hennink, who added she has since returned to work, no one close to her developed symptoms and no further precautions need to be taken.</p>
<p>"As you know with a viral illness, your highest point of excretion is in the period of time just immediately prior to the development of symptoms and then in the day or the day-and-a-half when the symptoms are very prominent. After that, exponentially the viral excretion decreases and goes down and so does the infectivity," Hennink said.</p>
<p>The young woman in Saskatoon developed symptoms after she and her family returned from Mexico, said Dr. Johnmark Opondo, a medical health officer with the Saskatoon Health Region. She was also tested at the end of April, and influenza A H1N1 was confirmed late Wednesday night.</p>
<p>"This individual was not in school while she symptomatic, so I think if there's any exposure it may have been very minimal or mild," said Opondo, who said the region would still be talking with the school board and school involved.</p>
<p>However, he declined to name the school citing privacy of the family.</p>
<p>"Every flu season when you send your children to school they're potentially exposed to influenza or any other virus that is circulating. I think we need to sort of put it in that context," he said, adding the virus has been behaving similar to a seasonal flu. "Your best protection is close observance to good hand hygiene, try to practise covering your cough or sneeze and if you have symptoms please stay home."</p>
<p>A couple of the teen's family members also experienced flu symptoms and may have also had the H1N1 virus, but there was no opportunity to test them before their symptoms had essentially passed, he said.</p>
<p>"But maybe that demonstrates how mild their symptoms were," Opondo added.</p>
<p>Neither woman was prescribed antivirals.</p>
<p>The province can now do all the testing for the H1N1 virus, and cases can be confirmed within a couple of days. The goal is no longer to test every possible case as it was when the flu situation first appeared, although regular testing is still being conducted, said McKinnon.</p>

<p>Swine flu is the media's new topic that has the public mesmerized. What happened to stories about the president, wars, the recession, layoffs, credit card debt, foreclosures, the stock market crisis? This swine flu hype has the travel and tourism business on its knees.</p>
<p>There has been 44 swine flu deaths in Mexico, a country of 110 million.</p>
<p>What about the 36,000 who die each year in the U.S. from flu or the 700,000 who die annually from heart attacks? The list goes on, and don't forget about our men and women who are killed in the line of duty.</p>

<p>The various provincial ministries of agriculture, veterinary associations (national and provincial) and the American Association of Swine Veterinarians have released statements all saying that no pigs in Canada or the U.S. are sick with this influenza.</p>
<p>The virus cannot be caught by eating pork.</p>
<p>It is incorrectly named and international health bodies are promoting a change in its name.</p>
<p>All pig producers are being alerted to increase biosecurity and restrict entry into their barns so people will not pass the disease to their pigs.</p>
<p>All that said, the media hype is still stuck on swine flu and I don't see that changing until they latch on to something else.</p>
<p>We just have to present our messages and hope it penetrates the hype soon, before everything is affected by something that so far, has nothing to do with pigs.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian scientists, working through the night to pick apart the genes of the human swine flu bug, have found nothing to explain why the virus circulating in Mexico appears more deadly than the one in Canada.</p>
<p>The finding - the first time in the world Mexican and Canadian samples of swine flu have been sequenced - means that "it's likely not the virus itself that is explaining the differential in severity of disease between Mexico and the rest of North America," Frank Plummer, scientific director general of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said in a conference call yesterday.</p>
<p>Instead, other theories abound. There could be many more cases in Mexico of people infected with minimal or no symptoms at all. Some people may be more vulnerable to developing more severe disease than others because of their genetic makeup.</p>
<p>"This is the first complete sequencing of the H1N1 flu virus and it's vitally important to our understanding of this outbreak," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>Genetic sequencing involves decoding the basic building blocks of the virus. "This is a world first and a real validation of Canada's scientific excellence," she said.</p>
<p>Cracking the genetic code of virus samples taken from Mexico, Nova Scotia and Ontario moves scientists a step closer to understanding how swine flu spreads and changes over time, how long it has been in humans, and where it originated. It will also help in the development of a vaccine.</p>
<p>The genetic sequences of the three viruses have been sent to GenBank, a public database where genetic sequences can be studied and compared by scientists around the world.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has raised its global totals to 1,658 confirmed cases in 23 countries. The disease is believed to have caused 31 deaths worldwide. Canada's national total yesterday stood at 165 confirmed cases. Mexico cut its confirmed death toll to 42, as dozens of test samples came back negative.</p>

<p>On Twitter, CNN's chief medical correspondent advocates the "el-bump" - bumping elbows, not fists, when you meet another person.</p>
<p>"It's not as cool as the fist bump, but cheaper," neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta tweeted over the weekend.</p>
<p>In Mexico, federal health authorities want people to stop shaking hands and giving kisses. Mexicans now wear surgical masks when they lock lips.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, the nation's health secretary has discouraged touching, kissing and hugging in public - anything not to get too close to other people.</p>
<p>Even in Lebanon, where the swine flu hasn't even hit, the country's health minister is advising residents to refrain from the traditional three kisses to the cheek.</p>
<p>"Let's stop the kissing habit," Mohammad Khalifeh exhorted last week.</p>
<p>What about us? Here in the land of the two-cheek "bec," how are Montrealers to behave socially now that the H1N1 virus is, in a small way, here?</p>
<p>One way is to practise "social distancing," some experts say. It's a question of medical etiquette, a good way to avoid infection.</p>
<p>You can feign a head movement, keep your hand in your pocket, blow a kiss or just pucker up to open air - anything to avoid casual contact that can lead to illness.</p>
<p>Institutions can help keep people "distanced," too. On its website, Concordia University lists various "planning assumptions" it has made for a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Among them: "Take social-distancing measures such as cancelling public events and suspending classes.</p>
<p>"If a severe outbreak were to occur, we should expect to suspend on-campus classes for seven to 10 weeks."</p>
<p>That's drastic enough. But simple pecks on the cheek? Can you really get swine flu that way?</p>
<p>No, some experts advise.</p>
<p>"This flu strain doesn't seem to be terribly virulent, so I don't think it's anything that should make anyone change their behaviour," said Dalius Briedis, who runs the infectious diseases department at the Royal Victoria Hospital.</p>
<p>"The bigger issue is whether the two-cheek kiss or handshaking is something to avoid. I mean, I know doctors and patients who refuse to shake hands anymore."</p>
<p>What about him?</p>
<p>"I'm 61 years old, so it's too late for me to change. If I see an old friend who wants to do the double kiss, I'm not going to say no."</p>
<p>Flu or no flu, keeping one's distance is not for everyone.</p>

<p>Quebec confirmed six new cases of swine flu yesterday, bringing the total to 10.</p>
<p>Public health authorities said the new patients contracted the infection after travelling to Mexico and the cases are considered mild.</p>
<p>"They are all in good shape and they are not hospitalized," said Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's public health department.</p>
<p>Three are in the Montreal area, one in Chaudière-Appalaches near Quebec City and two in the Lanaudière region. Poirier said that between 400 and 500 cases have been investigated by the authorities.</p>

<div>695 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>F7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>

<p>Autopsies of pigs infected with the H1N1 virus destroyed in Egypt show some of the animals possessed certain genetic properties that have given rise to speculation that should they have indeed been allowed to farrow while the virus continued to mutate, subsequent litters may have been able to fly.</p>
<p>Is ignorance actually bliss or is knowledge power?</p>
<p>Pigs can't fly. And, for the record, I reckon that no viral change or mutation or antigenic shift or drift is going to let it happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>Most readers will laugh off my attempt to get your attention. However, had I pawned off seeming credibility with some randomly concocted Eastern European scientist with a credible-sounding title to go with difficult (if not impossible) to pronounce name; then threw in a few other big words, like epidemiology, mitigation and sternocleidomastoid for good measure, finally adding a little spice of emotion - who knows? Maybe I could make some pigs fly after all?</p>
<p>On Halloween night 1938, CBS radio broadcasted Orson Well's reading of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. Newspapers reported that in the days that followed there was a widespread "tidal wave of panic" that, albeit short lived, swept the nation.</p>
<p>People honestly thought, as they huddled together and listened to their radios, that the Martians were coming.</p>
<p>Despite no less than four announcements during the broadcast that identified the program as a fictional radio play, people were still terrified.</p>
<p>Hadley Cantril, a social psychologist at Princeton, sought the reasons millions had been frightened. He published his results in the book The Invasion from Mars (1966).</p>
<p>According to Barry Glassner's brilliant 1999 must read, The Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things, based on his analysis of the Halloween broadcast and the subsequent reaction to it, Cantril concluded that the explanation "lay not in a lack of intelligence on the part of the listeners but in the acumen of the program's producers and the social conditions at the time."</p>
<p>We live, right now, in a climate of fear. People are freaking out about our environment, the economy, politics and Brittany's hair, all in virtual succession and at super speed.</p>
<p>Often, the more we learn, the less we can understand, but this doesn't have to scare us. Knowledge is power, but knowledge is not defined by one source or one seemingly credible voice. Knowledge comes in research and experience.</p>
<p>This weekend, I took advantage of The Gazette's digital subscription package, and visited the country through the weekend headlines and stories. Sure, some conspiracy theorists might berate these newspapers, citing the monopolization of the media by single-minded corporations, blah blah blah,. But I'm not a fool. Nor do we have to be fooled.</p>
<p>In this day and age, it would be foolish to take anyone's word as The Word. And no one says we have to. No one from the Canwest News Service swept into my office this weekend and said: "Mr. Addie, you cannot seek out other sources of information aside from the 11 papers that we own." And thus, I was able to visit the front pages of the world.</p>
<p>After visiting all over, I discovered the virtual epistemology of the H1N1 virus. I learned that there is much to be concerned with, but at this point, with a few simple precautions, some vigilance and more research; we can mitigate the course of this flu and our consequent reaction to it.</p>
<p>I also discovered, according to Noam Cohen writing for the New York Times on Sunday (The Hunt for Insights in the Online Chatter about Swine Flu), that "swine flu" actually displaced "American Idol" as the most sought term on Yahoo.</p>
<p>It is no longer 1938 when Orson Wells was Professor Richard Pierson. Martians have yet to arrive and pigs, likewise, still can't fly. We, however, sure can; and often with just a tap on our keyboard. I guess it just takes the impetus to want to.</p>

<p>- Now that pigs have the flu, are they part of a hamdemic?</p>
<p>- I think it's rather hypocritical of China to ban our pork, considering some of the crap that comes out of their country.</p>
<p>- If China bans Canadian pork, Canada should ban all goods from China.</p>
<p>- If we are supposed to be using soap and water to fend off the flu, why are the soap dispensers empty in the legislature washrooms?</p>
<p>- I think the schools are taking way too many precautions. My sister had a little cold and her teacher sent her home because she had the "symptoms of swine flu."</p>
<p>- While I agree cancelling school trips is an overreaction, have parents considered what the costs would be for a stay in hospital in the U.S. or Europe because of the flu?</p>
<p>- If parents are given a choice about whether their child learns about evolution, will I, as a teacher, have the choice to not teach creationism -- or trigonometry, for that matter?</p>
<p>- It's confusing to realize there are still people who don't acknowledge evolution. Besides the irrefutable scientific evidence, I would love one of them to explain why they have a tailbone, fingernails and muscles to move their ears.</p>
<p>- Given the way we pollute our water and air, I tend to agree with the creationists. We aren't very far along.</p>
<p>- How many Albertans are pushing for these parental rights embodied in Bill 44? Thousands? Hundreds? Tens? And who are they?</p>
<p>- The provincial government won't cover the cost of my tummy tuck -- you know the "birth defect" of having kids -- so why should they cover your sex change? I'm just as upset about the way I am as you are.</p>
<p>- If the government wants to increase the number of nurses graduating each year, it should look at reducing the costs of nursing programs across the country.</p>
<p>- There are no minimum qualifications to be a politician. In Alberta, the results are quite obvious.</p>
<p>- I would like to say a word in Ron Liepert's defence. Is jackass one word or two?</p>
<p>- If the City Centre Airport is redeveloped, I can't wait to see the architectural marvels the city will allow. We already have such inspiring examples of civic imagination in the designs we see on the old CN rail lands fronting 104th Avenue.</p>
<p>- Extending the LRT to Gorman will only contribute to more urban sprawl. Future LRT extensions should serve existing built-up areas, such as Mill Woods or the west end.</p>
<p>- The venter who says magpies don't deserve to be shot has obviously never tried to take an afternoon nap.</p>
<p>- People don't want to shoot magpies because of the noise. It's because they're invading the city and killing or chasing away all the songbirds.</p>
<p>- To my amazement, a motorcycle rider behind us passed a line of cars at a stop sign by driving onto the sidewalk and across the pedestrian crosswalk. We were too dumbfounded to get his licence number.</p>
<p>- Come on, Edmonton, chill out. If you don't like the sounds of summer, there are 40 other weeks of the year when you can sit in your houses and whine about the weather.</p>
<p>- The QE II Highway between Calgary and Edmonton should be renamed the Grant MacEwan Highway. That would allow MacEwan College to gracefully rebrand itself as The University of Edmonton. In this day and age, it was plain silly to name a highway after a monarch anyway.</p>

</div><div>RICHARD SCHABAS   </div>
<div>Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>998 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The outbreak of H1N1 influenza in Mexico has rekindled concerns about a global influenza pandemic. The response has been all too predictable. The World Health Organization has raised the level of pandemic alert and announced that "all of humanity" is under threat. The Public Health Agency of Canada has advised people not to travel to Mexico. The media are feasting on the story.</p>
<p>The facts, however, are more prosaic. Admittedly, when first reported two weeks ago, the events in Mexico were quite alarming. It seemed that a new influenza virus was causing serious disease, particularly in young people. This is precisely the scenario we would expect with the beginning of a new pandemic.</p>
<p>Since then, however, almost all the news has been good news, even if it hasn't been presented that way. The most important events have been the ones that haven't happened. It's not entirely clear exactly what is going on in Mexico but one thing is certain: H1N1 is not behaving like a new pandemic strain.</p>
<p>We now know that the first cases of H1N1 date from early March. This should put Mexico at or even past the peak of its first wave of infection. According to standard pandemic models, Mexico should be seeing about a 1,000 deaths each day. Obviously, this is not happening - not even remotely close. The illness caused by this virus seems to be very mild. And the virus itself might not be so "new" after all.</p>
<p>Some tourists returning from Mexico have brought the virus back with them to Canada and elsewhere. This is hardly surprising. What is more important is that the virus is showing no ability to transmit efficiently here, at least at this time of year. The WHO's notion that the disease is "spreading" every time a visitor brings it to a new country is misleading.</p>
<p>The story is not over yet. We need better epidemiology from Mexico and continued surveillance here. But, overall, the news is now very encouraging. While predictions are inherently hazardous, two scenarios seem most plausible. The virus might die out completely because it is just not quite infectious enough to survive in human populations. Alternatively, it might become established as our dominant seasonal strain. This really shouldn't worry us, however, because the disease is so mild.</p>
<p>So why isn't this message getting out? The sad truth is that there are strong vested interests flourishing from the fear of pandemics. Over the past five years, pandemic planning has mushroomed at all levels of government. Public health agencies have received substantial additional funding for pandemic preparations. Some professionals are building careers as pandemic experts. Good news about pandemics is simply not welcome.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to re-examine the underlying premises of these pandemic fears.</p>
<p>Influenza is an important infectious disease. It regularly kills more Canadians than any other infectious disease. Influenza pandemics do happen - triggered by the appearance of new strains for which we have no immunity - but many of our fears are based on misconceptions.</p>
<p>We should dispel the idea that an influenza pandemic necessarily means a catastrophe. The last two pandemics - the 1957 "Asian" flu and the 1968 "Hong Kong" flu - were not very different from seasonal influenza except that more people were ill. The 1918 influenza pandemic was worse, but much of the information about it is very sketchy. More to the point, a lot has changed since 1918. We have vaccines, antiviral drugs, antibiotics (most influenza deaths are from secondary bacterial pneumonia), intensive-care units, and, most importantly, far better general health.</p>
<p>We should also discard the perception that an influenza pandemic is an emergency. Pandemics unfold on a time-scale of weeks to months; not hours to days. A pandemic can't be "contained," only responded to. In other words, public health authorities should learn to take a little more time to gather and analyze information before raising pandemic alerts or launching pandemic plans.</p>
<p>We need to understand that influenza viruses are not going to change suddenly and become more virulent. This open-ended threat -- usually couched with the term "mutation" - is a theoretical possibility with any infectious disease. In practical terms, however, it is so rare that it doesn't merit serious consideration. It's the stuff of science fiction.</p>
<p>Once we correct our misconceptions, an influenza pandemic loses much of its terror. It is something we need to be prepared for - and generally are prepared for - but not something we should lie awake at night worrying about.</p>
<p>What lessons should we draw from this latest false alarm?</p>
<p>First, we need more and better information before reacting. The Mexican situation looked alarming at first. A little digging revealed a very different and more reassuring picture. There is no point in acting in haste.</p>
<p>Second, public health needs to stick to its principles, regardless of public and political pressures. Canada protested strongly when it was the subject of a WHO travel advisory during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We argued, correctly, that these advisories accomplish nothing except to spread fear and damage the economy of the country targeted. So why did Canada rush to issue a travel advisory on Mexico? It was irrational and unfair. Let's not make that mistake again.</p>
<p>Third, the media need to be more critical. How many pandemic false alarms do we need (remember "bird flu" - the last great pandemic threat) before reporters start asking tough questions? How many times do the voices of catastrophe need to be wrong before we doubt their message?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quebec students relieved to be released early; After Canadian government action, China relents on swine flu quarantine</b>

</p>
<p>China relented yesterday to demands to release the Canadian students under a seven-day quarantine since Saturday for suspected swine flu.</p>
<p>None had shown any symptoms of illness or fever but Chinese health authorities had sequestered the group of 27 Université de Montréal students when they arrived at Changchun airport in the northern province of Jilin.</p>
<p>In China to learn Mandarin, the students have been holed up in a hotel, playing games and drinking beer.</p>
<p>It is believed China relented after the Canadian government and the World Health Organization raised questions about the necessity of a quarantine.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of to-and- fro from the Canadian embassy saying, 'They're not sick, why are you keeping them?'" said David Ownby, director of the Centre for East-Asian Studies at Université de Montréal.</p>
<p>Health authorities sent in doctors to confirm the students were not sick yesterday, Ownby said after reaching the group's U de M teacher, Hongju Yu, earlier in the day.</p>
<p>"Obviously it's good news and it's earlier than we thought, so its very nice," said Martin Leroy Deslauriers, one of the students.</p>
<p>"Seriously, its going to be something we're going to remember all our lives. We don't know really how big the story was because we were confined in that area."</p>
<p>The lack of information was a problem for the students, Maxime Paradiso said.</p>
<p>"Being isolated, not having any information about what was going on and being cut off from the world, you know you're just bored, you have nothing to do but at the end of the day it wasn't that bad, I'm kind of happy its done," Paradiso said.</p>
<p>The students are due to be be bused to North East University of Changchun today.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Communication in crisis-- is less more?</b>
</div><div>John Larsen   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>848 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>So, it looks like we're getting to the end of this so called pandemic "crisis." Or are we?</p>
<p>Some reports cite "positive indications" that the virus is abating, others focus on the increasing spread and deepening severity of new cases, right here in Alberta. Apparently, according to Andre Corriveau, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health, the issue is becoming such a non-issue that he has better things to do than even run daily press conferences. Excuse me?</p>
<p>Last week the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert to the second highest; a level defined by "imminent widespread human-to-human infection." But, in Alberta, we were told by the Health Minister to "live your life normal," and that cases here are only considered mild.</p>
<p>I'm no scientist, so I don't know what information is right and what information is wrong, and I agree with the Minister that we shouldn't panic.</p>
<p>But, I'm guessing most Calgarians, and Albertans, are in the same boat as me; we need our health authorities to interpret this so-called crisis, and the conflicting information, for us. Where do we stand now, is it behind us or still evolving; how much concern is prudent? We need them to legitimize our concerns, give us the facts, and interpret what else we're hearing from other sources.</p>
<p>It has been a confusing mass of information over the past few days. Is it a Swine Flu or H1N1, and what's the deal with pork --is it safe or not --and what's with the export restrictions? Is this a pandemic, imminent pandemic or a past concern? Is it spreading quickly or reducing in intensity? Do we take a plane or stay clear of airports, as U. S. Vice-President Joe Biden advised? Should we have a mask ready or not bother because it won't help anyway? And what was with all those travel restrictions?</p>
<p>The United States issued travel advisories early on, Canada followed shortly after. But, the World Health Organization said travel restrictions were essentially irrelevant because they won't stop the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>Confused yet? Getting just a tad annoyed at it all? Totally understandable; and that's where the real danger comes in.</p>
<p>During times of crisis, or "imminent" crisis, the one thing governments and health organizations need most of all is the public's attention and trust.</p>
<p>People are generally very good at listening when their safety is threatened, but bombard them with multiple and conflicting messages and they get disoriented, become anxious, and start the cynicism.</p>
<p>Then, they disengage, and that's dangerous. Because if communication during crisis does not work, people won't take the actions required to keep themselves--and others--safe.</p>
<p>In Alberta, one thing that will be watched closely, and will be analyzed when all of this is said and done, is whether disintegrating the province's nine regional health authorities and creating one super-sized Health Services board is better. And, one measure to judge that will be how effectively the province can reach out to Albertans with timely, credible and believable information as this crisis either continues or winds down. The public communications effort will need to place as much emphasis on working the rumour mill, fired up from numerous other sources, as it will on getting the Alberta facts on the street.</p>
<p>An accepted principle of crisis communications is that you can't over communicate--that the channels of communication need to stay open. Generally this is true; but implicit in this is an assumption-- and expectation-- that authorities will be on the same page. We work on the premise that those who have been entrusted to give us the goods have been thinking about the key issues and implications for a while, that they know the science, and that they have specific priorities around what they want the public to know--and what actions they want us to take.</p>
<p>To achieve real success in public communications, our health authorities will need to work just as hard on co-ordinating messages with other health organizations as they do on preparing their own media statements.</p>
<p>They will need to think about how the public will interpret information, and how contradictions from other authorities can be rationalized. When asked about a conflicting health report from Ottawa concerning an Alberta case, Dr. Corriveau dismissed inquiries by saying simply that he "didn't hear what the federal minister said." Fair enough, but he also needs to recognize that Albertans are trying to reconcile these various statements, and that they both need and deserve adequate interpretation.</p>
<p>Question is: will crisis communications be more effective now that redundancies in the Alberta health care system have supposedly been eliminated? Hopefully, rationally, they should.</p>

<p>Re: "Alberta tap dances around facts on girl's flu," Don Braid, Opinion, May 5.</p>
<p>I do not understand why Don Braid is so exercised about the lack of details regarding the young girl who has contracted swine flu other than the fact that it has occurred. Nothing will change if we know the details of her illness. In fact, that information is privileged-- between her doctor and his or her patient. It would be unethical to do otherwise. The Hippocratic oath states: "All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or in the daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal."</p>

</div><div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>281 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Student absences at an Airdrie middle school jumped Wednesday as some parents kept their children home after learning a student at the school is recovering from a case of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Local school board representatives said about 13 per cent of students at Ecole Airdrie Middle School, where an unidentified pupil has a confirmed case of H1N1,were ab-sent Wednesday. Rocky View Schools spokeswoman Angela Spanier said that is an increase of about seven percentage points above average.</p>
<p>"Parents have phoned in with concerns," she said. "From all accounts, we believe absenteeism will drop over the next few days."</p>
<p>The school district sent letters to parents this week advising them of the confirmed case of swine flu.</p>
<p>A debate has been raging in Alberta about whether parents should be informed if someone at their child's school contracts H1N1 flu after a school-aged girl in Edmonton was hospitalized with the virus. Parents of children at the girl's school have not been notified. Health officials said the young patient is recovering in hospital.</p>
<p>Alberta Liberal Leader David Swann has accused government of "hiding information" about influenza cases.</p>
<p>But Health Minister Ron Liepert said the government's protocol on the matter is to notify the affected school board, which then has the right to decide on a course of action.</p>
<p>"Surely, that's a decision that a locally elected school board can make," he said.</p>
<p>The debate comes as Alberta reported four new cases of H1N1 influenza Wednesday in two men and one girl from Edmonton and a woman from northern Alberta. The province has 30 confirmed cases of the virus.</p>

</p>
<p>A case of swine flu, it seems, is no reason to notify parents so they can decide whether to pull their kids out of school.</p>
<p>Sex, though? That's serious. At the first mention of it, parents may snatch the kids and run for their lives. Religion? Even worse. Let our children go. We can't have theological contamination in the classroom.</p>
<p>That was the bizarre mixed message in the legislature on a strange Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>First, Health Minister Ron Liepert casually dismissed any need for the province to notify affected families about the case of an Edmonton schoolgirl who has a serious case of the new flu.</p>
<p>The province just leaves it up to school boards. An Airdrie school notified about a swine flu case; Edmonton didn't. All hail local autonomy.</p>
<p>That's the exact reverse of the province's approach to exempting students from sexuality and religion classes. In this matter, the province rules.</p>
<p>Conservatives generally believe that parents, not the government, should decide what's best for children. That's why Tory MLAs put religion and sex education into the new human rights law.</p>
<p>Now we have to wonder why this "right" is so important for religion and sex, but not for a major new health concern. There's no coherent answer from the Tories. It's not even clear that they grasp their own contradiction.</p>
<p>In general, though, they see issues they define as moral (sex, religion) as absolute, while little things like plagues are passing practical matters.</p>
<p>Rob Anderson, the bright young MLA from Airdrie-Chestermere, gave an able defence of the Tory view. He thinks Alberta is "big enough" to respect all parents' rights, while still keeping schools from the grasp of special interests.</p>
<p>The opposition counters that enshrining these rights will lead to trouble from groups that want to impose their views on the public school system.</p>
<p>New Democrat Rachel Notley said parents will withdraw their children from classes, then complain the students are victims of discrimination if they aren't offered alternate programs. It's the road to chaos, she claimed.</p>
<p>Then came Neil Brown, the Tories' double PhD and former biology teacher, who said forcefully he would not vote for the bill if it prevented teaching of evolution. It does not, he argued.</p>
<p>Brown added: "The earth was not created in six days and it is not 4,000 years old." In some corners of Toryland, that's actually a brave thing to say.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating and often eloquent debate from both sides. But outside the legislature, there are signs the bill means trouble.</p>
<p>The first hint came Wednesday when a group called the Canada Family Action Coalition endorsed it. Co-founder and executive director Brian Rushfeldt then went further, implying only parents should determine the scope of the bill.</p>
<p>"I don't know that the schools nor the government should be the ones to put parameters on it and say it's only sexuality classes or only evolution classes or only religion classes," he told the Herald's Sarah McGinnis. "That defeats the whole purpose of having parents have rights because someone else is making the decision."</p>
<p>Therefore, "it's up to the parent to make (the human rights provision) as broad or as narrow as they want."</p>
<p>We can see where this is going --human rights challenges, lawsuits, endless trouble for public schools and teachers. All this to appease a minority of parents free to put their children in a wide range of private schools, home school, or start their own charters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there's that little contradiction with swine flu. It was a very odd day.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>500,000 a day-- and it's still not enough; Edmonton's priMED has its plant in China working round-the-clock amid flu fears</b>
</div><div>David Finlayson   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>570 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>F1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Medical-supplies manufacturer priMED is turning away desperate requests for masks because its Chinese plant can't keep up with the demand sparked by the H1N1 flu crisis.</p>
<p>The Edmonton company's facility at Liyang, two hours west of Shanghai, is running 24 hours a day supplying the extra orders from its regular customers, chairman Chris Thompson said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We're getting lots of calls from RCMP detachments and school districts, but we can't supply them because of existing contracts and customers. It's really unfortunate because you can hear the desperation in their voices."</p>
<p>With demand up 50 per cent, the biggest problem for priMED is getting more raw material for the almost half a million masks a day the plant pumps out, Thompson said.</p>
<p>CEO David Welsh left for China Wednesday to try to secure more of the polypropylene-based material from suppliers -- especially the critical middle layer of three used in the masks.</p>
<p>Many of the masks available are simple one-piece with ear loops, while priMED's have three layers that filter bacteria and particles yet allow comfortable breathing.</p>
<p>"The real magic is in the middle layer," Thompson said. "It filters out particles continuously but you can still breathe, and it's that material that's harder to get."</p>
<p>While business dealings in China have improved in recent years, it's still quite unpredictable, said Thompson, who lived there for several years before starting the company in 1995.</p>
<p>You can be promised 15 metric tonnes of product, only to be told later you've been bumped. And the government can step in and take away supply at any time.</p>
<p>Ideally, priMED would open its own raw materials plant, but it's too costly right now, he said.</p>
<p>Welsh will spend at least two weeks doing the rounds and schmoozing with suppliers, while Thompson assures regular customers it won't raise prices.</p>
<p>In fact, priMED makes less money during issues such as SARS, Avian Flu and H1N1, because input and overtime costs go up, he said.</p>
<p>"We're loath to raise our prices because it looks like we're taking advantage of the situation. We do get some back in volume, but the unit profit decreases."</p>
<p>Thompson is also urging customers not play on people's fears and hoard supplies to make extra profit. During the SARS crisis 10-cent masks were selling for $5 at Vancouver International Airport, he said.</p>
<p>It's such a big issue the federal government should look at how supplies can be co-ordinated nationally, and perhaps with the U.S., Thompson said.</p>
<p>The company has just begun a plant expansion that will double the number of employees to 1,000. They were planning it long before the current flu outbreak because business is so good, he said.</p>
<p>It has annual sales of about $30 million from masks, medical exam gloves, caps, hospital gowns and other supplies.</p>

<p>"The swine flu was nothing compared to this," Landon said Wednesday night in the smoke-filled air outside of the complex where he had just moved in and where he makes a living enticing others to do the same. "We just got married and moved in and now this happened."</p>
<p>Landon said their wedding pictures were all safe online, but his new wife's wedding dress was destroyed along with other wedding keepsakes.</p>
<p>The brand-new complex featured buildings that each contain five units: one bungalow and four two-storey townhomes.</p>
<p>The Carlsons lived in Building 4 of the complex, which caught fire just before 9:30 p.m. Wednesday. Landon was home when it started.</p>
<p>"I didn't even have a chance to grab anything because the power went out right away," he said.</p>
<p>The blaze was sparked when an internal gas line to one of the unit's meters ruptured, said Edmonton fire department spokeswoman Melanie Mochoruk. Atco was on scene trying to shut the gas line off, but had not done so by 11 p.m.</p>
<p>At that time, the fire was under control, but Building 4 was destroyed by the two- alarm blaze, Mochoruk said. Some of the nearby buildings were also damaged.</p>
<p>Only two of the units in Building 4 were occupied, one by the Carlsons and the other by Vanessa Troock and her boyfriend, Ryan Lays.</p>
<p>As firefighters battled the blaze, Lays and Troock paced nervously among the dozens of people at the scene. Neither had been home when their building caught fire, but their brand new beagle puppy was in his crate in the basement.</p>
<p>Luckily, around 10:45 p.m., a firefighter brought D.O.G. out wrapped in a big grey blanket. The puppy wriggled excitedly as Lays took him.</p>
<p>Neither they nor the Carlsons knew where they would stay. Residents at the scene said they had been told they likely would not be let back in Wednesday night.</p>

</p>
<p>Edmonton's two school districts announced on Wednesday they have reinstated national and international field trips, but will continue to monitor the world's swine flu situation for any significant changes.</p>
<p>Edmonton Catholic schools spokeswoman Lori Nagy said schools had four trips left for the remainder of the year, two inside Canada and two internationally -- one to L.A. and one to Seattle.</p>
<p>Eight school trips were cancelled.</p>
<p>Parents with students on international trips that were cancelled will be reimbursed for their costs, and the board will look at the different costs associated with the Canadian trips and perhaps compensating parents for those.</p>
<p>Most of the trips were band trips, Nagy said.</p>
<p>Both the public and Catholic school boards cancelled all international travel and air travel in Canada last month because of fears about swine flu.</p>
<p>"We made the best decision at the time based on the most up-to-date information we had," Nagy said.</p>
<p>"Now that we have had time to look at what else is going on in the world where influenza is, what other authorities are saying, we feel comfortable reinstating those trips with the proviso that if the influenza status changes in the world again, we will take a closer look."</p>
<p>Nagy said parents still have the final say whether their children will go on the trips.</p>
<p>Edmonton public schools superintendent Edgar Schmidt said he has been monitoring the flu situation and has decided to reinstate field trips based on the advice of Alberta's chief medical officer.</p>
<p>The district had suspended those field trips involving international travel and air travel within Canada. Six trips were cancelled and there are 10 trips remaining that involve international and air travel in Canada.</p>
<p>"We have a lot more information on what the situation is ... and what I have determined, at this point, is we are going to be following the advice of the chief medical officer as it relates to travel, which means field trips with air travel within Canada, as well as international travel, will continue as planned," Schmidt said following a private meeting with board members Wednesday.</p>
<p>Schmidt said he will also review the issue of reimbursing those parents for the cancelled trips.</p>
<p>He said he could not say when a decision will be made.</p>

</p>
<p>After mounting a spirited defence of its decision to quarantine a group of Canadian students and their teacher, China relented Wednesday and let them go free.</p>
<p>The 27 students from the Universite de Montreal and Laval have been under quarantine in Changchun, in northeastern China, for suspected H1N1 flu since last Saturday. None had any recent contact with a flu victim or had shown any symptoms before they were summarily sequestered when they arrived to begin a 10-week language course.</p>
<p>The decision to release the students was made after both the Canadian government and the World Health Organization raised questions about the necessity of a quarantine.</p>
<p>Their doubts echoed this week's vocal diplomatic spat between Mexico and China over claims that China was targeting Mexican citizens for quarantine whether they were a possible flu risk or not.</p>
<p>China denied the charge, but on Tuesday it released all of the Mexicans in quarantine across the country and allowed the Mexican government to repatriate them on a special flight.</p>
<p>The Canadians were due to be released this Saturday.</p>
<p>"Obviously it's good news and it's earlier than we thought, so it's very nice," said Martin Leroy Deslauriers, one of the students. "Seriously, it's going to be something we're going to remember all our lives.</p>
<p>"We don't know really how big the story was because we were confined in that area."</p>
<p>Amelie Beiken was just glad to released.</p>
<p>"It feels good to go outside and just have some fresh air, just to go out and walk somewhere we haven't been, to be free."</p>
<p>The Canadian government said Tuesday a diplomatic note would be sent to China's Foreign Ministry expressing "deep concern" that Canadian officials had been denied full access to the students, said a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon.</p>
<p>"We are seriously concerned ... as to why they were quarantined, because there doesn't seem to be any reason at this stage," said Deepak Obhrai, Cannon's parliamentary secretary.</p>
<p>A Canadian consular official travelled to Changchun to meet the students Tuesday, but was given only limited access. A quarantined student who spoke with Canwest News Service, Montrealer Martin Leroy Deslauriers, said the Canadian official was only allowed by Chinese authorities to meet the students for a couple minutes.</p>
<p>A Mexican plane arrived in China on Tuesday to bring home 43 Mexicans who had also been quarantined by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry had defended the quarantine, saying it was in line with international and domestic law, and the students had agreed to the quarantine, Xinhua News, China's state news agency, reported.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadians first to crack genetic code of virus; Winnipeg research sets stage to develop vaccine</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>552 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Canadian scientists working through the night to pick apart the genes of the human swine flu bug have, in a world first, sequenced the virus in a Winnipeg laboratory.</p>
<p>"This is a world first and a real validation of Canada's scientific excellence," federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>Genetic sequencing involves decoding the basic building blocks of the virus. Samples of virus taken from Nova Scotia and Ontario and samples from Mexico appear to be a genetic match. The team found nothing to explain at the genetic level why the virus is causing severe pneumonia and deaths in Mexico, while cases in Canada and the U.S. have been mostly mild.</p>
<p>"That's one of the big questions that everybody has been asking," said Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director general of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>"It's likely not the virus itself that is explaining the differential in severity of disease between Mexico and the rest of North America."</p>
<p>Cracking the genetic code of the virus moves scientists an important step closer to understanding how swine flu spreads and changes over time, how long it has been in the human population and where it originated. It will also help in the development of a vaccine.</p>
<p>The genetic sequences of the viruses have been sent to GenBank, a public database studied and compared by scientists around the world. "This is a significant and important milestone for us, but there is still a lot more work ahead of us," Plummer said.</p>
<p>Officials also said Wednesday the outbreak of swine flu in a central Alberta hog farm has been contained.</p>
<p>Officials believe the pigs contracted the virus from a Canadian worker who returned from Mexico on April 12 and arrived on the farm two days later. It is the first known human-to-swine transmission of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Officials said the pigs have recovered, or are recovering, and that no decision has been taken to cull the herd.</p>
<p>"We can reassure Canadians unequivocally that the situation remains contained on that farm," said Dr. Brian Evans, Canada's chief veterinary officer. Evans said the pigs from the Alberta hog farm could enter the food supply once they have recovered and are shown to pose no threat to human health.</p>
<p>He said the standard operating practice in Canada is "you do not slaughter sick animals and you do not slaughter dead animals for human consumption."</p>
<p>Canada's total number of confirmed cases of swine flu stands at 201. Canada's public health agency confirmed 36 new cases across the country Wednesday -- eight in British Columbia, four in Alberta, 13 in Ontario, six in Quebec and five in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, WHO raised its global totals to 1,658 confirmed cases of swine flu in 23 countries. The disease is believed to have caused 31 deaths worldwide.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Michel C. Dore, an official with the Civil Security department, said that some employers are asking staff returning from Mexico to get a certificate of good health before resuming their work.</p>
<p>Those requirements are against public health recommendations and could overburden the system, he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province's top vet vouches for safety of Alberta pork; Virus 'completely gone' after sick pigs recover, he says</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema and Trish Audette   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>822 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Albertans should not be concerned about eating pork, despite a caution from the World Health Organization to avoid pigs infected with the H1N1 virus, the province's top veterinarian says.</p>
<p>"Our position hasn't changed and pork is still safe to eat," Dr. Gerald Hauer said. "In our system, we eat only healthy animals. There are many checks and balances in place to make sure only healthy animals go to slaughter."</p>
<p>Hauer was responding to a story from Reuters which quoted a WHO representative who said meat infected with the H1N1 virus shouldn't be eaten.</p>
<p>"Meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead should not be processed or used for human consumption under any circumstances," said Jorgen Schlundt, director of the WHO's department of food safety and foodborne diseases. He said the flu virus can survive the freezing process and may be present in meat and blood.</p>
<p>But Hauer said sick animals or animals that have died from infection are never slaughtered in Alberta and never reach the food chain. He said pigs, such as the 2,200 in a central Alberta herd infected by a carpenter who returned from Mexico with swine flu, are only infected for a certain amount of time and never become flu carriers.</p>
<p>"Pigs get the virus, they get sick, they get over it, the virus is gone," Hauer said. "It's completely gone out of their system. Their immune system takes care of that, so we don't have these carrier animals that are a concern."</p>
<p>Yet because of public perceptions, Hauer said the pigs on the Alberta farm remain under quarantine until the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and other organizations devoted to public health decide how to handle the herd.</p>
<p>"We're breaking new ground here, so we have to consider a lot of different factors to make that decision," Hauer said. "There are optics around this and I guess that's what we're trying to do. ... The system we have in place is working. We're doing our best to get that message out."</p>
<p>Alberta Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld said any pork product that is suspicious does not go into the pet-food chain.</p>
<p>"It adds to the emotions and the fear out there," Groeneveld said in response to the newest message from the WHO representative. "It's unfortunate that these types of quotes come out there and I'm sure the WHO is not pleased either because that's not their position at all."</p>
<p>Groeneveld could not say whether there will be any provincial program to aid the pork industry. Canada Pork International has said pork exports across the country are down 10 to 15 per cent since swine flu was found in an Alberta herd.</p>
<p>Jodi Bakki, director of policy and communications for Alberta Pork, said Alberta's production is down about 3.8 per cent since China and Russia banned all swine and pork from the province.</p>
<p>She said retailers are reporting no significant drop in pork purchases, but the overall market has seen a $20 drop in price for each animal.</p>
<p>Bakki said the WHO statement about not eating sick animals isn't applicable to Canada.</p>
<p>"We already meet the standards and exceed the standards that they are referring to," Bakki said, suggesting the statement might be more applicable to countries where similar standards aren't met. "The protection of human health is the pork industry's first priority and that's why we have strict safety standards."</p>
<p>Alberta reported four new cases of swine flu Wednesday, bringing the provincial total to 30 cases.</p>
<p>A man and a girl, both from the Edmonton area, have only mild symptoms after travelling to Mexico. Another man from the capital region and a woman from northern Alberta also have mild illnesses, but neither travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>Only one Alberta case, that of a young Edmonton-area girl, required hospitalization after being hit particularly hard with the swine flu. She remained in hospital Wednesday. Parents, students and teachers at her school haven't been told of her illness.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said Wednesday that it's up to school boards to decide if a school needs to be closed because of a medical issue.</p>
<p>Edmonton-Strathcona NDP MLA Rachel Notley said parents are looking to the chief medical officer for guidance and information about swine flu and whether their children's schools have been touched by the case.</p>
<p>"So far, all we have is chaos."</p>

<p>A medical-supplies manufacturer is turning away requests for masks because its Chinese plant can't keep up with the demand sparked by the swine flu crisis. The plant is running 24 hours a day supplying the extra orders from its regular customers, chairman Chris Thompson said Wednesday. "We're getting lots of calls from RCMP detachments and school districts, but we can't supply them because of existing contracts and customers." With demand up 50 per cent, the biggest problem for priMED is getting more raw material for the almost half a million masks a day the plant pumps out, Thompson said.</p>

</p>
<p>Ben Bernanke was in the right spot at the right time. Before becoming chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, Bernanke was an economics scholar whose area of expertise just happened to be the Great Depression.</p>
<p>No economist in the world knew more than Bernanke about that terrible event, and specifically about how the banks and financial institutions dealt with it at the time. Bernanke came to believe that one of the causes of the Depression was that banks were reluctant to lend when times got bad.</p>
<p>When Bernanke succeeded Alan Greenspan to become America's top money man, no one could have predicted that his intense knowledge and study of the Depression -- and the role that banking played -- would be so vital. But it has. As banks began failing, bad debts stopped being paid and the global stock markets cratered, Bernanke emerged on the scene having spent a lifetime preparing for what to do.</p>
<p>We have seen dark days since late 2008. The North American auto industry teetered on the edge. Americans walked away from their homes, some even living in tent cities in California. Confidence, a vital part of the huge consumer economy, flagged.</p>
<p>While the rest of us fretted, Bernanke dropped interest rates to historic lows, attempted to make credit easier for businesses and consumers, and used monetary tools at his disposal to move the economy forward. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has gone a long way to support a number of financial institutions and intervene in the sagging auto industry.</p>
<p>The good news is that all these measures appear to be working. The recession continues, but Bernanke and others at the Federal Reserve believe the worst is over.</p>
<p>Bernanke and the Fed are not alone in this view. World stock markets have been rising on the same belief, though it would be more reassuring if they did so on greater volume.</p>
<p>Bernanke has learned that you don't change a winning game. The Fed will maintain interest rates near zero and will continue to buy up $1.7-trillion US worth of treasury bills and mortgage bonds to further stimulate the economy. The Fed says consumer spending has levelled (with car purchases providing most of the 2.2-per-cent annual increase) while financial conditions have improved.</p>
<p>"The economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower," the Fed said the other day. All this is occurring before government stimulus can reach the economy, which, when it does, will provide a further boost.</p>
<p>Still, for the person on the street, there will be more uncertain days ahead. Don't expect unemployment to rapidly decrease. Even if consumer demand comes back, companies will be able to ramp up production without necessarily hiring people. As well, residential and commercial construction is still decreasing in the U.S.</p>
<p>Yet there are unmistakable signs of strength. Stock markets have remained stable in the face of the H1N1 flu threat. And in Canada, the long-term outlook for our commodities is bullish.</p>
<p>The recession is not over, but it's entirely possible that we have turned the corner.</p>

</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>538 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization further muddied the waters on Wednesday about the risks of the H1N1 virus, a.k.a. swine flu, with misguided advice on the safety of meat from pigs.</p>
<p>In response to questions from a journalist, WHO advised that meat from infected pigs shouldn't be used for human consumption under any circumstances.</p>
<p>That advice is based on a theoretical risk of transmission from the H1N1 virus from the flesh or blood, even if the meat has been frozen.</p>
<p>Canadian officials say the latest advice from WHO is meaningless here, since the meat inspection system here already culls any sick or dying animals.</p>
<p>The one farm in Canada where pigs have been infected with the virus -- apparently from a human -- has been quarantined.</p>
<p>Through all of this, the advice from provincial and national health authorities and the International Food and Agriculture Organization has been the same: There is no risk -- none -- from eating pork.</p>
<p>There may be some benefit in letting people who handle uncooked meat in other countries know that freezing does not kill the virus. But that message could have been delivered more deftly.</p>
<p>Given the irrational reaction to this virus both by individuals and countries, it appears likely that the advice will do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The pork industry has already been hard hit by fear of the flu based on the name "swine flu," which public health officials belatedly realized they should not have used because it falsely implied pigs are to blame.</p>
<p>But the move came too late.</p>
<p>Some 20 countries, including Russia and China, have banned the import of pork and pigs from Mexico, the U.S. and Canada and the price of pork, not surprisingly, has been falling.</p>
<p>For Canadian pork farmers, the latest hit comes at a time when the industry is already plagued by overproduction.</p>
<p>In poorer countries such as Mexico, the lost revenue for pig farmers contributes to poverty that is of itself a hazard to human health.</p>
<p>Indeed, among the speculations as to why the same flu virus has been more deadly in Mexico than in Canada and the United States is that the host population is not as healthy to start with.</p>
<p>We know that a new flu virus spreading quickly throughout the world is a potentially serious threat, so we must take extraordinary precautions until the nature and magnitude of the outbreak are fully understood.</p>
<p>At the same time, health officials and politicians have to understand that some of the actions taken out of an abundance of caution are themselves harmful.</p>
<p>In a year when the economies of most countries were already in decline, the added burden of lost tourism, health-related border and trade restrictions and in Mexico, production losses due to quarantines, will add further pain, much of it needless.</p>
<p>Where science and best practice dictate such pain is necessary to prevent further harm, we should act accordingly.</p>
<p>We recognize that with so many unknowns these aren't easy decisions. But we always have to keep track of the price of such actions as well as the potential benefit, whether at home in Canada or abroad.</p>

<p>Re: "Please - can we get a grip?" (Gazette, May 6).</p>
<p>Bill Brownstein's account of people losing their perspective over the swine flu is valid. The Era of Frenzy has arrived. Two years ago, a grocery store in Perth, Ont., posted a sign in the women's washroom enumerating the contortionist positions to use to avoid touching anything in that room: One paper towel for the toilet; another for the faucets; for the hands, and the doorknob, etc.</p>
<p>However, people forget that when they shop, they are picking up canned goods and food previously touched by whoever stocked the shelves as well as other shoppers. Are we to start using robots to replace our own limbs?</p>
<p>It is time we stop being influenced by frenzy from websites and newspapers and use common sense in going about our daily lives. Otherwise, we become prisoners to others' prognostications instead of making use of our own sound judgment.</p>

<p>As a confirmed Mexiphile and one who travels to that sunny country every year, I have to admire the way Mexico City has handled the outbreak of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine any other great city voluntarily closing itself down to confine a virus. This, of course, has caused serious economic problems, but Mexicans' recognition of what is at stake and their willingness to co-operate is remarkable.</p>
<p>Oddly, there has not been a single case of the virus reported in any of the Pacific coast resort cities - Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, Ixtapa, etc., and the city of Guadalajara with 5 million people, and only two hours from Mexico City, also does not have a single case.</p>
<p>It is possible that this mysterious virus might well, as some have suggested, come back in a stronger version later, but for now, gracias to our North American neighbour for a job well done.</p>

<p>How long till she kisses a pig? I was checking out Katy Perry's blog the other day - hey, the soap operas were over and it was too early for Jeopardy! and a guy's gotta do something, you know? - and I came upon a pic of her showing off a ring with a flying pig on it. "Since swine flu is super trendy," she wrote, "I wanted to make sure I was in style with my swine flu ring! I got this one in Miami at Big Drop the other day ... a flying piggy."</p>
<p>There's more, too. Referring to her cat with the too-clever name, she wrote this: "Kitty Purry was telling me the other night that she remembers when bird flu was in and now pig flu is cool and she wonders when kitty flu is gonna hit, as she would like to be more popular than she currently already is ... fame whore."</p>

<p>Madonna is planning a gig in the main square of St. Petersburg, Russia, in August. Local officials, smelling money, are putting up all kinds of roadblocks, reports the New York Post. "Local authorities - the ones who haven't yet been bribed - are up in arms," the paper says. One has said the concert will be a "natural disaster," which just goes to show that even in Russia, everybody's a critic these days. Another is demanding "guarantees that there will be no blasphemy."</p>
<p>Let me make a wild guess here: Somebody from Madonna's entourage, toting a briefcase, will go see all these people and by the time the case is empty, the objections will have vanished.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Second case of swine flu reported; Man, who recently visited Mexico, recovered after 'mild symptoms'</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>400 words</div><div>7 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>A second case of the Mexican swine flu has been discovered in Ottawa one day after the city's first case was reported.</p>
<p>If, as expected, it is confirmed by the province today, the latest case would bring the total number of Ontario cases to 50.</p>
<p>Like the first Ottawa case, this one was discovered in a man who recently returned from Mexico, said Dr. Isra Levy, the city's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The man had travelled more than a week ago and returned with flu symptoms, Levy said. He declined to provide specifics about exactly when the man was in Mexico.</p>
<p>Public health officials are trying to determine if there is any connection between the two Ottawa men who have so far tested positive for the novel H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"At this point, we haven't established any link between the two individuals. It looks like it's two separate situations," said Levy.</p>
<p>He indicated that the man in the second case sought medical attention within days of returning to Ottawa and was told to restrict his contact with other people.</p>
<p>Levy said the man "presented with mild symptoms" and has since recovered fully.</p>
<p>Even so, public health officials are attempting to track down those who have had contact with the man to determine whether they have shown any signs of infection, said Levy.</p>
<p>Levy would not disclose the man's age, saying only that he fit the profile of other Ontarians who had been infected, all of whom were under 50.</p>
<p>Levy indicated that the Ottawa cases are likely surfacing now, more than two weeks after the outbreak was discovered in Mexico, because there is a lag between the time diagnostic tests are ordered and when the results are available.</p>
<p>What's more, as part of the city's pandemic surveillance, doctors have been screening more patients for the swine flu virus, meaning more tests are being ordered for an illness that otherwise shares similar symptoms with more common flu strains. "We've seen a lot of tests being done on people presenting in that kind of general way and those tests are sitting in the laboratory," Levy said.</p>
<p>As a result, Levy warned the city may see more cases being reported in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Would you show up for work if it meant putting your life at risk? What about the lives of your children?</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of us face little more than stress or fatigue when we head to our jobs, but for nurses, work can sometimes bring the risk of illness, even death.</p>
<p>Which is why, six years after SARS claimed two Ontario nurses and a doctor among its victims, nurses in this province are keeping a closer eye than most on the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>For many, the emotional trauma of SARS is still a vivid memory.</p>
<p>"I didn't sleep the night before I decided to work in the SARS unit," one nurse told the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario for a post-SARS report. "I knew that one suction catheter from a SARS patient would have enough virus in it to begin an epidemic."</p>
<p>H1N1, the current virus to put the world on edge, began in Mexico earlier this year and has travelled around the world, mostly in a mild form. There are signs it is beginning to retreat before it becomes a full-blown pandemic, but it has caught the worried attention of those who worked through SARS.</p>
<p>It has also raised some troubling questions about what happens next time, including this one: What if there is a pandemic and some health-care workers don't show up?</p>
<p>Pandemic absenteeism is such a worrisome possibility that it has been widely studied, with some startling results. One U.S. survey estimated that up to 50 per cent would be unwilling to work during an influenza pandemic, citing their own and their family's health. A German survey found that up to 28 per cent of health care workers, "may abandon work in favour of protecting themselves and family." Surveys of physicians in Singapore and Australia also found many were concerned about protecting their families' health during a pandemic.</p>
<p>The tension between responsibilities to job and family was one of the stark realities of the SARS crisis for many Ontario nurses.</p>
<p>The report, "SARS Unmasked," produced by the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario after the outbreak, painted a disturbing picture of the emotional turmoil experienced by nurses.</p>
<p>"Nurses were often found crying. And nurses were stressed by their own family's reactions; some were pressured to stay away from work. One nurse was told, 'If you go to work, you are not part of this family'."</p>
<p>Nurses working in SARS units, the report said, experienced frustration, anger, isolation and stigma.</p>
<p>"Many nurses used the phrase 'social pariah' to describe the stigma associated with being a nurse during this crisis. ... Nurses were refused day care, dental care, and other types of community-based health care."</p>
<p>Health care workers are, of course, trained and prepared to face hardship and risk. That commitment is particularly strong during an emergency, such as a pandemic, says Doris Grinspun, executive director of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario.</p>
<p>But even a strong sense of responsibility might break down in times of stress -- when nurses are needed most -- if they do not feel properly protected, supported or informed.</p>
<p>Those were some of the issues raised by nurses and nursing officials during the SARS crisis. Of particular concern was that nurses were not listened to and their expertise was not taken into consideration. Between the second and third waves of SARS, many nurses believe that if health officials had listened to their concerns that the illness was not gone, further deaths could have been prevented.</p>
<p>Testimony from nurses led Justice Archie Campbell, who headed the commission of inquiry into SARS, to warn that health officials have to listen to nurses and other health care workers' concerns if they expect them to answer the call the next time.</p>
<p>"Every day, they stepped into danger," Justice Campbell said. "I take away (from this work) not just the pain of the families, but a sense of wonder that nurses and doctors showed such courage."</p>
<p>Nursing officials were thinking of Justice Campbell's warnings that the provincial government must listen to nurses when the H1N1 virus caught the world's attention. And has it been listening?</p>
<p>Many things have improved since SARS, says Grinspun.</p>
<p>When SARS hit, only about 50 per cent of nurses in the province worked full-time, meaning many of them had two, three or even four employers.</p>
<p>A directive during the outbreak that nurses only work at one place created a dangerous and unanticipated nursing shortage as well as hardship for nurses. Five years later, nearly 65 per cent of nurses have full-time jobs.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a plan in place to deal with a pandemic or major health emergency and health workers including nurses are being informed and listened to. Part of the anxiety during SARS was that nurses felt they were being kept in the dark about what was going on.</p>
<p>But there are concerns. The provincial government has stalled on a promise to add 3,000 new nurses, reducing it to 900.</p>
<p>"In good times we need 3,000, let alone now with this threat on our doorstep," said Grinspun. "This is not about alarming the public, this is about reality."</p>
<p>H1N1 may prove to be a false alarm, but it may also serve as a useful reminder about listening to nurses and work yet to be done.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking makes for an unusual expression of nationalism, but it's not the only weird one.</p>
<p>While the Chinese government is reportedly asking its citizens to buy cigarettes to boost the economy there, Canadians are being asked to boost Canada's economy by eating pork.</p>
<p>"I appeal to Canadians and consumers around the world -- eat an extra pork chop or pork roast," Jurgen Preugschas, president of the Canadian Pork Council, urged this week. The Canadian pork industry is reeling because many countries have banned imports of the meat after a herd of Alberta pigs was infected with H1N1 flu from a worker.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz was to host a pork lunch on Parliament Hill to show that eating Canadian pork is not only risk-free, but the patriotic thing to do.</p>
<p>It's not the first time we have been told that consumption -- of food or other things -- is for the good of the country. After 9/11 we heard that the best way to defeat the terrorists was to head to the shopping malls. Now in the current recession, we are told that adding an extra bathroom or finishing the basement is what psychologists call pro-social behaviour.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that governments use nationalism and national identity to persuade people to spend money; after all, businesses have been doing it for years. <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> has brilliantly turned a doughnut and coffee into a proxy for the Maple Leaf. Molson's "I am Canadian" campaign did the same for a particular brand of beer.</p>
<p>There is no real harm in appealing to the flag this way, the cigarette example being a notable exception. Certainly most Canadians understand that their country is, ultimately, more than a collection of empty coffee cups and pork chops.</p>

<p>I think there is an urgent need at this particular time to discourage handshaking with the advent of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Did you know that a virus can remain active on a hand for two hours? There is clear medical evidence that handshaking is one of the ways that increases the chances of the virus spreading. How many times during a week do people shake hands at a sporting function, social event, place of worship, and in the world of business?</p>
<p>There is a particular problem with people who are not washing their hands. It is estimated about 20 per cent of the population do not even wash their hands after using the washroom.</p>
<p>A recent Ontario government report on hand-washing found that only 35.3 per cent of workers at CHEO, 54.9 per cent at the General campus of The Ottawa Hospital, and 56.2 per cent at the Civic campus are compliant. It must be acknowledged that they are working to improve the situation. However, if it is this poorly practised at our major hospitals, what is it like in other workplaces and environments?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if so many people are not hand washing then is it wise to shake hands when we are concerned about the possible mutation of the H1N1 virus?</p>
<p>I am not trying to be overly alarmist. However, reason dictates that people not only increase their hand washing, but consider refraining from hand shaking at this time. It is also crucial that the World Health Organization and the Public Health Agency of Canada decide whether it is in the public's interests to temporarily discourage the practice of hand shaking."</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>These are peculiar times. Pigs catch swine flu from humans, Canadians who didn't buy Chryslers (or Fiats) now own a pricey piece of the company and while we struggle to save feudal Afghanistan, nuclear Pakistan is failing.</p>
<p>Connecting those scattered dots is the disturbing common denominator of misunderstanding. A convenient label for a complex virus is so confusing the flu's cause and effects that consumers are afraid to eat pork.</p>
<p>Federal and provincial governments that encouraged the auto capacity to outgrow consumer demand are now bailing out one of the bankrupt results.</p>
<p>Countries, most notably Canada, that didn't know much about Afghanistan before sending troops there, are now learning the full and frightening truth about their regional ignorance.</p>
<p>These things happen and aren't about to stop. Unforeseen or simply misjudged events unfold. Leaders everywhere respond with an imperfect alloy of public policy and political self-protection.</p>
<p>Far more frustrating, and ultimately more problematic, is the refusal to prepare for what is predictable.</p>
<p>Politicians, whose visions often stretch no further than the next election, see little reward in challenging worn shibboleths or jolting voters out of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Letting Canadians wallow in complacency was never a sound idea. Last fall it became dangerously delusional. Along with destroying wealth and dreams, the financial meltdown and global recession announced watershed change. As surely as greed shattered trust, a gaping hole was blown in the comforting assumption that the future would be a reasonable facsimile of the past.</p>
<p>Tough on every country, that sudden realignment is particularly cruel for Canada. Good has been good enough for so long here that too few noticed how fast the country is falling behind by staying in the same place. More creative economies are growing faster and challenging our prestigious place at global forums.</p>
<p>Ottawa's claims that Canada is again starring on the world stage are absurdly mismatched against the pinched realities of foreign policies shaped by domestic politics.</p>
<p>Current events drag those abstractions back to earth. Monday's news featured another top researcher moving south, lured as much by Barack Obama's commitment to a knowledge economy as by his $10 billion investment. Two days later a depressing yet hardly surprising Science, Technology and Innovation Council study rated Canada's performance as, well, mediocre.</p>
<p>Education isn't just a competitive fix; it's the only available magic elixir. Among so many other things it lets us wisely weigh the safety of what we eat, the wisdom of corporate investments and the profound implications of sending Canadians abroad to serve and die. Education not only helps make some sense of testing times and a chaotic world order, it puffs up every part of life.</p>
<p>Smart is now said to be the new cool. If Michelle Obama and Michael Ignatieff shout it out, then it must be so. Still, it's hard to shake the notion that rather than contend with informed voters, politicians prefer to apply mushroom methods to citizen by keeping them in the dark and feeding them on fertilizer. That protects the elected elite from answering awkward questions and providing explanations for black-is-white policies that hurt the head.</p>
<p>Let's hope smart does become our new cool. Hewing wood and drawing water has served us well. But being hip is our best, perhaps only, hope of succeeding at a time when a nation's most precious resource is its brains.</p>

<p>You can add mathematical formulas to the surgical gowns and masks people are using to fight outbreaks such as the current H1N1 influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>University of Guelph mathematics professor Chris Bauch is collaborating with colleagues at two American universities to devise a pandemic plan for combating the H1N1 virus, with far-reaching implications for dealing more effectively with future disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>Using scientific information from demographics and past pandemics into modelling provides health officials with valuable insight into how best to quickly curtail their spread, Bauch said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We see an increasing integration between decision-making and mathematical modelling, which is a good sign, because mathematical modelling is very systematic and transparent. So it's a good basis for decision-making," Bauch said.</p>
<p>The technique's been under development since the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic of 2003, a previously unknown viral illness from China whose origin and spread initially had North American health officials stumped. It caused widespread fear among the public and ultimately led to almost 800 deaths globally.</p>
<p>"I think the SARS outbreak really helped to propel this kind of preparation," Bauch said. "That is a growing trend, which is very encouraging."</p>
<p>It's work well worth doing, he stressed.</p>
<p>"If you act early and aggressively, it really pays off in terms of the long-term implications and reducing the long-term disease burden."</p>
<p>The model, using population demographics, game theory and data from outbreaks all the way back to the early decades of the last century, allows simulations of the spread of disease "so we can figure out which combination of strategies will most effectively halt the outbreak." That'll help health protection officers decide when and how to apply countermeasures, such as medical intervention and isolation of populations at highest risk, like schools.</p>
<p>David Waltner-Toews, a professor of population medicine at the University of Guelph, said models are needed because scientists can't safely experiment with the spread of dangerous organisms, which are called pathogens, in real-world situations. "You'd end up infecting people."</p>
<p>Simulations allow scientists to explore on their computers scenarios likely to play out under various conditions. "I think that becomes very important. It gives us insight."</p>
<p>He cautioned, however, models are only partially helpful in predicting the spread of diseases since there are so many variables in the real world, such as how organisms evolve under various conditions and how people react to outbreaks. But they're well worth pursuing as another tool in the arsenal of health officials.</p>
<p>Bauch's work on the spread of the H1N1 flu virus taps about 10 researchers, including university students. He hopes to have the H1N1 pandemic model completed and presented to Canadian authorities at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion within several weeks. He stressed the method will be useful for other pathogens.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada defies warning; Countering world health body, leaders say our pork is safe</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The government says pork is safe to eat despite a warning by the World Health Organization that the pig strain of H1N1 flu virus could survive in slaughtered pigs.</p>
<p>"Canadian pork is safe. There is no danger,'' Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz insisted yesterday after serving up pork sandwiches to MPs and government workers on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, a WHO official said the pig strain of the H1N1 virus may withstand freezing and persist in the thawed meat and blood of infected animals.</p>
<p>The warning came as Canada's H1N1 flu caseload jumped to 201, with 36 new mild cases reported. That included 13 in Ontario, eight in B.C., six in Quebec, five in Nova Scotia, and four in Alberta.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Canadian scientists became the first to genetically sequence the virus and confirm that the same strain is spreading through Canada and Mexico -- even though it has killed 42 Mexicans and been relatively mild here.</p>
<p>One possibility being considered is that the Mexican victims may have had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible to the bug.</p>
<p>Jorgen Schlundt, director of the World Health Organization's Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases, told Reuters it's possible for influenza viruses to survive the freezing process, and he cautioned against eating meat from sick and dead pigs infected with the swine flu.</p>
<p>But Dr. Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said that's not an issue in Canada. He said Canada has safeguards to keep diseased pigs from making it to market.</p>
<p>Those checks make it virtually impossible for infected pork to end up on store shelves, he said, since pigs are screened on farms for illnesses before they ever make it to the slaughterhouse. Swine also undergo a clinical pre-assessment at slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>"The message that is coming out clearly from WHO today, which is standard operating practice in Canada, is the fact that you do not slaughter sick animals and you do not slaughter dead animals for human consumption,'' Evans said.</p>
<p>"This doesn't change anything in Canada. What the WHO is saying is what we do every day, every week, every month, every year as part of our food inspection system.''</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, also said there's no cause for concern.</p>
<p>"There is no reason to stop eating pork,'' he said. "The inspection system in Canada does address all those issues.''</p>
<p>Bacteria such as Listeria, salmonella and E. coli all pose a greater risk than H1N1 flu in raw pork products, said Brian Ward, an infectious disease specialist at McGill University.</p>
<p>"Does this add any real risk to handling or preparation of pork products? No, I don't think so at all,'' Ward said.</p>
<p>"You'd really have to have a fairly extensive, linked series of improbable events that would all have to occur -- including, then, sticking your fingers in your eye without washing them.''</p>
<p>The virus is killed by cooking meat at temperatures above 70 C.</p>
<p>There's no evidence that anyone has caught swine flu from eating pork. Still, 10 countries have banned Canadian pork products since the virus was found on an Alberta farm. China in particular banned pork from Alberta.</p>
<p>Canadian politicians and health officials have appealed to countries to lift the pork ban, which producers fear could do to their industry what the 2003 mad cow disease outbreak did to the Canadian cattle industry when exports were shut down for more than a year.</p>
<p>Canadian pork exports were valued at $2.7 billion in 2008, including nearly $527 million worth of live swine exports.</p>
<p>Officials announced yesterday that researchers at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg had become the first to sequence Canadian and Mexican samples of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>And they have ruled out a mutation to explain why the Mexican cases have been much more severe than elsewhere.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The region remained free of confirmed cases of the H1N1 influenza virus, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health reported late yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Ontario count yesterday was 49 known cases of the respiratory illness that usually affects pigs but can be transferred to people, it noted in a release.</p>
<p>Local medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer, who typically holds daily media briefings on the flu situation, was at a board meeting yesterday and unavailable.</p>
<p>The Canadian total stood at 165 confirmed cases yesterday.</p>
<p>Mercer's health board noted federal progress in battling the pandemic that began several weeks ago with outbreaks in Mexico and the U.S. but has now spread to almost two dozen countries. The national microbiology lab in Winnipeg determined the virus, based on samples from Ontario, Nova Scotia and Mexico, has not significantly mutated from samples from Mexico, based on a preliminary analysis.</p>
<p>The board added this genetic decoding will aid in development of a vaccine.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA, CALGARY, TORONTO -- Farmers debated culls and Canadian politicians dished out pork yesterday as pig producers faced a consumer-confidence crisis brought on by a new flu strain that has passed from swine to humans and back again.</p>
<p>“What is clear is that there is no concern about the safety of pork,” Jurgen Preugschas, chair of the Canadian Pork Council, said as MPs and staffers wolfed down pulled-pork sandwiches served by federal cabinet ministers in a courtyard of Parliament Hill's East Block.</p>
<p>Mr. Preugschas urged Canadian families to eat pork and help pig farmers who have seen their meagre profits whittled away by fears that the A/H1N1 virus could somehow be passed through the food chain.</p>
<p>But the public-relations gesture that filled political bellies was undermined when a World Health Organization official was quoted by Reuters yesterday saying that meat from pigs infected with the new virus shouldn't be consumed.</p>
<p>Doctors had previously said the disease could only be transmitted through respiratory fluids.</p>
<p>In an e-mail exchange with The Globe and Mail, the director of WHO's Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases cautioned consumers against eating meat from sick or dead pigs infected with swine flu because the virus may survive the freezing process.</p>
<p>“Almost all microorganisms, including most viruses, can to some degree survive freezing,” Jorgen Schlundt said.</p>
<p>But Dr. Schlundt stressed that influenza viruses are not known to be transmissible to people through eating pork. “Heat treatments commonly used in cooking meat will readily inactivate any viruses potentially present in raw meat products,” he added.</p>
<p>In Alberta, where a carpenter who visited Mexico transmitted the virus that infected about 450 pigs on a farm of 2,020 animals, pig producers are worried they will all be tarnished with the spectre of unsafe meat.</p>
<p>Arnold Van Ginkel, who has a 3,000-sow farrow-to-finish operation in west central Alberta, said the infected herd should be culled in order to protect Canada's reputation.</p>
<p>“I think they should get rid of the herd and then you can show everybody there's not a problem,” he said.</p>
<p>John Middel, who has a 500-sow farrow-to-wean operation near Rocky Mountain House, Alta., said sick pigs are not sent to slaughter in the first place so there's no way they would end up on grocery-store shelves. Nonetheless, a cull may be in order.</p>
<p>“Even if they are healthy there is always the perception, and right now there is only preliminary information out there so why not cull them and keep them out of the food chain as a precaution,” he said.</p>
<p>Paul Hodgman, executive director of the Alberta Pork Producers, said the farmer who owns the infected pigs is “absolutely devastated,” and it's up to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to decide on next steps. Legislation prevents sick pigs from making it to slaughter and into the human food chain, he said.</p>
<p>Brian Evans, CFIA's vice-president, said there has been no decision taken to cull the herd, still under quarantine in Clearwater County. “We are seeing recovery in the herd,” Dr. Evans told reporters in Ottawa. “It is not our intent to do any depopulation or culling of the herd under the present circumstances.”</p>
<p>Pigs that were exposed to the virus and have completely recovered pose no threat to consumers and can be slaughtered for meat, he said.</p>
<p>There are no other reports of Canadian swine being infected with the virus.</p>
<p>The number of people infected in Canada yesterday climbed to 201, with 36 new mild cases. A female staff member at Toronto's Princess Margaret Hospital was among the new cases – the country's first among hospital workers. She had no history of recent travel to Mexico and wasn't providing patient care, leaving the source of her illness unclear. The woman is recovering at home, and a hospital spokesperson yesterday urged patients not to forego appointments or care because of the case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health officials boasted yesterday that Canadian scientists became the first to genetically sequence the virus and confirm that the same strain is spreading through Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>The virus has been less severe outside of Mexico. But Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it's difficult to predict what will happen when the flu season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>“We could see the current strain fizzle out and never come back again. We could see the current strain come back as it currently is or see it mutate and change and come back in a more severe form,” Dr. Besser said, adding that governments must be prepared.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario confirmed 13 new cases of the swine flu yesterday, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 49.</p>
<p>The new cases were spread out across the province in communities such as Toronto, London, Windsor and Sudbury, but all of the cases were said to be mild.</p>
<p>The province also confirmed that the flu virus in Ontario is the same one as in Mexico, Nova Scotia and the United States.</p>
<p>"The good news is that we're not seeing a lot of mutations of the virus, we're not getting a rapidly changing picture," said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health. "It doesn't seem to be highly communicable and it doesn't seem to be highly virulent, so that's reassuring."</p>
<p>In all, 30 women and 19 men in Ontario have contracted the virus, officials said. More cases are expected as lab testing ramps up in the next few days. Out of the 3,000 samples received, 2,000 have been completed.</p>
<p>Health Minister David Caplan said that while all cases were mild, caution was still needed.</p>

</p>
<p>A second student in Halton has caught swine flu.</p>
<p>The student is from a different school and community than Halton's first case of H1N1 flu confirmed in a teenager attending Christ the King Catholic Secondary school in Georgetown.</p>
<p>The two appear to have no connection to each other or to Mexico where the flu started. Public health hasn't been able to determine how either student caught the virus.</p>
<p>Medical officer of health Dr. Bob Nosal expects there will be more cases as the flu spreads across the province. There were 13 new cases yesterday, bringing the total ill in Ontario to 49.</p>
<p>Hamilton has no confirmed cases.</p>
<p>The news H1N1 is in Halton caused a flurry of concerned calls to the region's public health department yesterday and some parents appeared to be keeping their kids home from school as Christ the King had a higher than usual number of students absent yesterday.</p>
<p>"Where it starts to hit home is suddenly now when there is this new virus and it's right within their school," said Nosal.</p>
<p>He wouldn't provide details yesterday of the second student's age, school or community.</p>
<p>Both students have mild cases of the flu and are at home recovering. Neither had to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>"We pray to God that we don't have more cases pop up in the next few days," said Christ the King principal David DeSantis. "We're taking the necessary precautions to protect our family of staff and students here."</p>
<p>DeSantis cancelled an event yesterday that would have brought the bishop and students from five elementary schools to Christ the King.</p>
<p>A public health nurse is coming to speak to staff today about swine flu.</p>
<p>And handouts have gone out advising anyone with flu symptoms to stay home.</p>
<p>But otherwise DeSantis said it's business as usual at the school.</p>
<p>"We're monitoring the situation, but we're not being paranoid," he said. "I think we've done everything possible and reasonable."</p>
<p>Students appear to be taking it in stride.</p>
<p>"Surprisingly, they're pretty laid back," he said. "They're saying, 'Sir, it's just the flu.' I think our community is well educated and they haven't really bought too much into the hype."</p>

<p>Airbus SAS, the largest commercial-aircraft maker, scaled back its delivery schedule for the A380 superjumbo, as airlines resist accepting large planes while demand for flights is depressed by the global recession.</p>
<p>Airbus will hand over 14 double-decker A380s this year, down from the 18 planes it had planned, and will deliver more than 20 next year, the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer said yesterday. The reduction will have "no significant impact" on earnings before interest and taxes this year, the plane maker said.</p>
<p>Global international airline traffic fell 11 per cent in March, accelerating a decline that began in September, the International Air Transport Association reported April 28.</p>
<p>The outbreak of H1N1-type flu, which began in late April, has worsened the short-term forecast for air travel. Production of the A380 is already running two years late because of problems with installing wiring.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Canadian scientists discovered nothing in the genetic makeup of the H1N1 virus that would explain why symptoms are far more severe in Mexico than in all but one of the 201 confirmed cases here.</p>
<p>A team of researchers at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg worked day and night to finish the first genetic sequencing of samples of the virus from Canada and Mexico in less than a week, federal health officials announced yesterday.</p>
<p>"This does take us a step forward in terms of our understanding of how the virus works," Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Scientists mapped the building blocks of three samples from Mexico, Nova Scotia and Ontario and ruled out genetic mutation as the reason why the virus appears to be far more virulent in Mexico.</p>
<p>That leaves scientists looking elsewhere for answers. Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director at the Winnipeg laboratory, said they are looking at other factors like the environment in Mexico, the existence of another infectious agent spreading through the country at the same time or the individual genetics of the Mexican patients.</p>
<p>Living conditions in Mexico and how quickly a patient first went to the hospital are also possible factors, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>The only severe case in Canada remains that of a young girl from Edmonton.</p>
<p>Last night, a spokesperson at Toronto's Princess Margaret Hospital confirmed a hospital worker is at home recovering after contracting the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu. It has been determined the ill worker had no link to Mexico.</p>
<p>The hospital revealed few details about the employee. All spokesperson Gillian Howard would say is that she is a female who was not involved in direct patient care.</p>
<p>The staffer had a nasal swab taken about six days ago. There is about a five-day turnaround on lab test results, Howard noted.</p>
<p>Howard said hospital officials were evaluating and following up with any colleagues who had direct contact with the ill worker.</p>
<p>Princess Margaret is not advising patients to stay away from the hospital if they have appointments. It's business as usual, Howard said.</p>
<p>Public health authorities across Canada yesterday announced 36 newly confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus to bring the total to 201.</p>
<p>There are eight new cases in British Columbia, four in Alberta, six in Quebec, five in Nova Scotia and 13 in Ontario.</p>

<p>Swine flu on farm raises alarm,</p>
<p>May 4</p>
<p>Canadians have good reason to be proud of their history in farming. But after years of good farmland being lost to urban sprawl and the corporatization of the farming sector, factory farms are replacing the traditional family farm. The result is high concentrations of animals in confined spaces.</p>
<p>Apart from the environmental effect of massive manure lagoons and the ethical concerns regarding the treatment of animals in such farms, there is growing evidence that our health could be at risk.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problems with factory farms have only intensified. I strongly urge our government to consider regulations that will reduce the allowed limits on animal populations in factory farms. This will not only reduce health hazards, but will also help the viability of family farms.</p>

</p>
<p>Steady rain dampened hopes of downtown Victoria businesses for thousands of visitors yesterday during 10-hour stops by the two largest cruise ships ever to pull into Ogden Point.</p>
<p>Shopping was spotty on tourist-oriented Government Street, where some stores were bustling with lineups, while others saw little business. Even so, the street was busier than usual, despite the steady downpour.</p>
<p>On Government Street, Californian Christy Powers, who arrived on the Carnival Splendor, was chilly and shopping for more clothes. "We traded all our shorts for jackets," she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>The Carnival Splendor and Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas were rerouted to a Pacific Northwest cruise from a planned tour of Mexican ports because of worries over swine flu. Powers opted to keep her booking because she'd never visited Canada before.</p>
<p>Along with many other visitors, Powers planned to tour <span class="companylink">Butchart Gardens</span> and visit the Fairmont Empress hotel. Powers, who owns a travel business, said she will now be able to tell her customers about this area.</p>
<p>She was pleased that her cruise ship was -- for several minutes -- the biggest to visit Victoria. "We made history."</p>
<p>The Carnival Splendor, at 952 feet long, arrived first. Next in was the Mariner of the Seas, at 1,020 feet, which beat the other ship's record shortly after noon. Each vessel has a capacity of about 3,000 passengers.</p>
<p>A festival atmosphere pervaded Ogden Point as hundreds of local residents turned out to watch the vessels back into the piers. Traffic slowed to a crawl along Dallas Road, where parking spots were full. Viewers armed with cameras lined the sidewalk and others went out on the breakwater for a prime view.</p>
<p>Dressed in Victorian clothing, members of Victoria A.M., a non-profit society that supports tourism in the area, greeted disembarking ship passengers. A white tent with red balloons featured a live band, aboriginal dancers and drummers, free tea and <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> goodies, as well as Tourism Victoria staff with an information table.</p>
<p>"I think it is the glamour of the big white ship," Paul Servos, Greater Victoria Harbour Authority CEO, said of the crowd appeal. The two ships are arriving for a total of 21 visits this season, bringing millions of additional dollars into the economy. A record 235 cruise-ship visits are expected this year.</p>
<p>Some businesses stayed open later than usual and called in extra workers because the two ships were scheduled to stay until 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Jim Munro, at Munro's Books, called the weather "wet and miserable" while looking out the door of his 1108 Government St. store. He had been hoping cruise ship visitors would fill the aisles, but that had not happened by mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>A "smattering" of cruise ship visitors visited Irish Linen Stores, 1019 Government St., said part-owner Barbara Lamb. "When the weather is like this, people will opt to do the city tour on a bus."</p>
<p>Several Government Street souvenir stores were busy thanks to tourists taking home T-shirts and other mementos.</p>
<p>At <span class="companylink">Butchart Gardens</span>, several hundred passengers arrived and enjoyed themselves, said spokesman Graham Bell.</p>
<p>Ann Johnson and husband Osmel Motas of California had not been planning a cruise but booked on the Carnival Splendor because of the low rate offered for a balcony room. Motas said the weather wasn't an issue. Johnson laughed, saying she was going to shop. "I have money."</p>
<p>Kathy and Jack Burton, of Sacramento, Calif., had planned to celebrate their 46th anniversary in Mexico but stayed with the Carnival Splendor because they were interested in returning to Victoria. Their plans: "Shop till we drop."</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean incentives convinced A.J. and Paul Gresovic, of Austin, Texas, to keep their booking, despite the new route. A.J. was "disappointed, but we can always do the trip [to Mexico] some other time."</p>

<p>Time to file a new flight plan that puts passengers first; Canada's airlines are feeling the pressure as MPs ponder a bill that would impose tough penalties for flight delays and cancellations. Already buffeted by turbulent economic times, Canada's airlines are bracing for a rough ride over passengers' rights.</p>
<p>"Sorry" doesn't cut it if your annual vacation has been shortened by missed connections, your baggage is sitting in another city or a delay has left your aircraft parked on the apron and you are sweltering in your seat. And what of those travellers in the past week whose flights to Mexico were cancelled by the airlines because of the swine flu outbreak? Only WestJet offered passengers a full refund.</p>
<p>Under a proposed Passenger Bill of Rights now before Parliament, airlines and tour operators would have to offer passengers a full refund in such circumstances -- or face a penalty of $1,000 payable to each passenger.</p>
<p>Though the legislation isn't federal government policy -- it's a private member's bill from Manitoba NDP MP Jim Maloway -- it has struck a chord with all three opposition parties and stands a real chance of becoming law.</p>
<p>That prospect has the airlines flapping, for the bill also proposes steep fines when airlines keep passengers in planes stranded on the tarmac and fail to quickly announce flight delays, route changes or cancellations.</p>
<p>Airlines say the bill might even threaten passenger safety by pressuring flight crews to take risks to avoid delays. The airlines say they can better address passenger complaints through existing regulations, which detail passenger rights to meal vouchers and hotel rooms in the event of certain delays and cancellation refunds,</p>
<p>While the proposed legislation might be too tough for the airlines right now, something stronger than a list of good intentions is clearly required. Passengers deserve a smoother ride than they've been getting.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian scientists working through the night to pick apart the genes of the human swine flu bug have, in a world first, sequenced the virus in a Winnipeg laboratory.</p>
<p>"This is the first complete sequencing of the H1N1 flu virus and it's vitally important to our understanding of this outbreak," Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>Genetic sequencing involves decoding the basic building blocks of the virus.</p>
<p>Samples of virus taken from Nova Scotia and Ontario and samples from Mexico appear to be a genetic match.</p>
<p>Cracking the genetic code of the virus moves scientists an important step closer to understanding how swine flu spreads and changes over time, how long it has been in the human population, and where it originated. It will also help in the development of a vaccine.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>- Officials said yesterday the outbreak of swine flu in a central Alberta hog farm has been contained.</p>
<p>- The World Health Organization warned that meat from pigs infected with the new H1N1 virus shouldn't be used for human consumption.</p>
<p>- Canada's public health agency confirmed 36 new cases across the country yesterday, raising the total to 201. Eight new cases were confirmed in B.C., four in Alberta, 13 in Ontario, six in Quebec and five in Nova Scotia. None of the new cases are on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>- After mounting a spirited defence of its decision to quarantine a group of Canadian students and their teacher, China relented yesterday and let them go. The 27 students had been under quarantine in Changchun, in northeastern China, since last Saturday.</p>

</p>
<p>A Metchosin elementary school will remain closed until at least Monday following a spate of flu-like illness that might include cases of H1N1 or "swine flu" virus.</p>
<p>As many as 30 per cent of Hans Helgesen Elementary School's 188 students in kindergarten-Grade 6 were absent, many of them with what could be influenza, when the decision was made to close the school on Tuesday afternoon, said Dr. Richard Stanwick, the Vancouver Island Health Authority's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"We're definitely going to go through the weekend with the closure," he said.</p>
<p>Dunsmuir Middle School in Colwood is also being watched now that the absentee rate has reached 15 to 20 per cent, but there are no closure plans so far. A note has been sent home to parents advising them of the situation.</p>
<p>Stanwick said testing of specimens by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control to determine if any Hans Helgesen students have the H1N1 virus is not expected to be complete until tomorrow at the earliest. He said the specimens have been given high-priority status for testing.</p>
<p>"What we're anticipating is BCCD will have something for us on Friday, but there's absolutely not a guarantee.</p>
<p>"They are probably seeing test volumes of 10 to 20 time higher than normal, so they truly are receiving an enormous amount of specimens for testing. And, of course, everybody needs and wants to know what their test results are."</p>
<p>Should any of the cases turn out to be H1N1, the closure would continue through Wednesday, Stanwick said.</p>
<p>He said norovirus, a gastrointestinal ailment that can spread quickly, has been ruled out as the cause of the Hans Helgesen outbreak, but other viruses could be at work.</p>
<p>Stanwick said there is a possible link to travel in Mexico through at least one student at the school.</p>
<p>Trudy Court, who has a daughter in Grade 5 at Hans Helgesen, said she was satisfied with the actions of officials at VIHA and the Sooke school district. Her child has not become ill.</p>
<p>"This is more of a precautionary thing as far as I know," she said. "The district's doing its best to keep the parents advised."</p>
<p>Kyara Kahakauwila said her two boys are also healthy. "Having two boys in the school it has impacted us, but we'll get through the next couple of days and back to school on Monday, hopefully."</p>
<p>Ron Warder, assistant superintendent for the Sooke school district said the district is checking absentee numbers daily.</p>
<p>Stanwick praised the district's response to the Hans Helgesen closure.</p>
<p>"They've done a stellar job in terms of notification. We're working very closely with them -- they're tracking the absentee rates at other schools, and we're in daily communication."</p>
<p>Closing Hans Helgesen was the right choice, he said -- especially in light of the recent closure of Decker Lake Elementary near Burns Lake due to high absentee rates.</p>
<p>Three students were later confirmed to have H1N1 flu.</p>

<p>An Edmonton medical-supplies manufacturer is turning away Canadian requests for masks because its Chinese plant can't keep up with the demand sparked by the H1N1 flu crisis.</p>
<p>PriMED has a factory at Liyang, two hours west of Shanghai, which is running 24 hours a day supplying extra orders from its regular customers, chairman Chris Thompson said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We're getting lots of calls from RCMP detachments and school districts, but we can't supply them because of existing contracts and customers. It's really unfortunate, because you can hear the desperation in their voices."</p>

<p>METCHOSIN -- An elementary school on Vancouver Island has been closed after up to 30 per cent of its students contracted an influenza-like illness, health officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>The school was closed to reduce the potential spread of illness, determine its cause, including whether it is swine flu, and to allow sufficient time for specimen analysis to be completed, said a health-authority spokeswoman.</p>

</p>
<p>Following is the viewpoint of the writer, associate dean of the Levene Graduate School of Business at the University of Regina's faculty of business administration.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Egypt began to slaughter its roughly 300,000 pigs as a precautionary measure against the spread of swine flu even though no cases have been reported in either humans or animals in that country. Religious reasons were behind its decision, but many still consider it extreme.</p>
<p>At least 12 countries from China to Russia to Ukraine have banned imports of all pork products. Even Canada has seen its share of panicky assessments, with pork inspections increased to assuage any consumer concerns in light of the global outbreak of influenza A H1N1. This even though there is no evidence -- none -- that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals.</p>
<p>Worse, no scientific data suggest this H1N1 strain has any link to hogs. Meanwhile hog futures are down and the industry is losing millions. From an epidemiological standpoint, the menace is real. But, when it comes to food safety, the "swine flu" story is a really nothing more than a sign of the times.</p>
<p>Across the globe, the panic over this virus is incommensurate with the risks of contracting swine flu by eating pork. Public officials are making unfounded decisions, at best based on trivial information. The obvious culprits are the media, but there's a lot more going on here than mere fear-driven reporting.</p>
<p>Many criticize the media for bombarding the public with misinformation or insufficient information during times of crisis, creating disproportionate fear or panic. But panic is more likely to occur when a threat receives substantial media coverage. In a crisis, journalists need instant access to data that might not yet exist and to specialists and authorities who might not be available or feel unprepared to comment.</p>
<p>Like consumers and trade officials, the media, too, must make crucial decisions based on weak evidence. In addition, because public understanding of science is often limited with respect to such crises, it poses a challenge for the media to get the message across clearly. Media coverage of the H1N1 outbreak has proven both frightening and functional. The stories create fear and apprehension, but also provide an opportunity for people to become informed.</p>
<p>Currently, no other public authority than the media can play a more effective role during a public health crisis in Canada. Media today operate virtually in real time, whereas public authorities must react painstakingly in such cases. Unlike the media, from whom the public is willing to accept a certain degree of error and backtracking, public health authorities cannot prematurely release information that could go so far as to prompt the unnecessary slaughter of thousands of perfectly safe and healthy livestock.</p>
<p>What has been interesting during this H1N1 crisis, at least in Canadian media, is the frequent repetition that pork is safe and there's no evidence this flu is spread by pigs or by pork products. Yet, pork futures are dropping and healthy pigs are being slaughtered in yet unaffected parts of the world as a "precautionary measure."</p>
<p>The reason may have less to do with real panic over the epidemic and more to do with how the food trade works. Borders serve important roles in modern economies and usually are only opened selectively to food trade. They safeguard national sovereignty, impose economic protectionism and assure the screening out of undesirable products. Regrettably, embargoes and restrictions occur almost daily for all sorts of reasons, justified or not, and H1N1 has provided the latest excuse for some countries.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these measures foster market fear, which leads to unwise behaviours. Pork is the cheapest protein available, and many developing countries depend on its accessibility and affordability to feed their people. Restricting pork imports will devastate food retailers, the transportation sector, restaurants, and most importantly, consumers. Economic multiplier effects, coupled with panic over the infectivity of H1N1, may also create a pervasive atmosphere of fear and pessimism that could aggravate the current global economic downturn.</p>
<p>What really triggered this health panic is the fact that the public is now more prone than ever to accept risk prevention measures, especially concerning food. BSE, foot-and-mouth, salmonella, listeria, and E. Coli outbreaks have forever altered consumers' risk perceptions worldwide. Even a succession of less serious food recalls and food-related nuisances have taken their toll, and public authorities know this. Nonetheless, many argue their decisions may make matters worse, not better.</p>
<p>It is difficult to blame anyone for the hog industry's woes. Media, the public, and the food trades all are inclined to respond aggressively and even prematurely to such events. The unfounded correlation between the current pandemic and the hog industry simply exists in people's minds and it may be too late to avert major losses. Chicken farmers in some parts of the world had to face the same problem a few years back with the avian flu spread.</p>
<p>Media do have a role to play in food crises, but global events related to food are inherently fluid and the message should constantly change. The disconnect between hogs and H1N1 should become evident in a relatively short time, as the epidemic itself seems to be mellowing. Whether such revelation will occur in time to prevent serious damage to agriculture sectors worldwide, however, is unclear.</p>

<p>Another case of the H1N1 flu virus has been confirmed in the Windsor and Essex County area, bringing the local total to five and the provincial total to 49.</p>
<p>Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann announced the confirmation of the fifth local case on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It's a 21-year-old male," Heimann said. "The individual's symptoms, as we understand it, are mild. The individual was not hospitalized."</p>
<p>Similar to the four previously confirmed cases in the area, the fifth case is related to travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Local cases now involve three males and two females, all of them in their 20s. All are considered mild cases, with the patients recovering at home.</p>
<p>Heimann said the health unit has followed 60 local patients so far. Of those, about 30 have tested negative for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health, said the total positive cases across the province involve 19 males and 30 females, ranging in age from 4 to 52.</p>
<p>None of the cases in Ontario has required hospitalization.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Toronto remains the community with the most confirmed cases at 12.</p>
<p>According to Williams, confirmation of the virus is happening faster now because of increased laboratory testing capacity.</p>
<p>"Ontarians should continue to protect themselves and those around them by washing hands frequently, coughing or sneezing into your sleeve, and staying at home if you're sick," Williams said.</p>

<p>Swine flu's biggest chat network on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> had more than 64,000 members yesterday, beating teen heartthrob Zac Efron's largest group by 5,600 and the official fan club of President Barack Obama's dog, Bo, by more than 63,000.</p>
<p>At the same time, "swine flu" lost out to "Happy Cinco de Mayo" as Twitter's most-used term after falling behind "Happy Star Wars Day" on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>In the age of Twitter, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and YouTube, the first global near-pandemic to go viral has fleeting popularity. Social networking sites inform the public even as they illustrate the Internet's uneven power as an arbiter of what matters and what is a fitting target of ridicule.</p>
<p>"Sources of information on the Internet carry the veneer of being authoritative," said Anthony D'Urso, a psychologist at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. "While it is the greatest way of getting information to the general population there is the risk that people focus on the least authoritative information."</p>
<p>One set of posts on Twitter.com from a man who identified himself as Steve Lange, a father of four in New Mexico, ranged from mocking to grim.</p>
<p>"Watching the "Andromeda Strain' on DVD," he wrote on April 30. "Never know when you might need some 'outbreak pointers.'"</p>
<p>Another of his posts said he recalled his grandfather talking about "bodies piled like wood" during the 1918 flu epidemic that killed 20 million worldwide. Lange didn't respond to a telephoned request for comment.</p>
<p>After Mexican authorities announced last month that they had an influenza epidemic, swine flu drew up to 2.82 per cent of Internet chatter, according to Nielsen Online, more than five times what Scottish singing discovery Susan Boyle attracted after competing on television game show Britain's Got Talent.</p>
<p>Flu comments ranged from suggestions that people should panic to assertions that the outbreak is a plot to distract people from bank bailouts, as a person who identified himself as Steve Fox wrote on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> on May 3 from Spain. Fox did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>"Social media do potentially facilitate mob rule because of its instantaneous, sometimes context-light attributes," said Hanson Hosein, director of the Master of Communication in Digital Media program at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
<p>It's far different from the epidemic of 1918 when U.S. newspapers downplayed the disease as a means to quell panic, according to John M. Barry, author of the The Great Influenza.</p>
<p>Today, the globe is drowning in information and disinformation on H1N1, which now has sickened more than 1,100 people in 21 countries. Mashable.com, the self-proclaimed social media guide based in San Francisco, reported on April 27 the disease was attracting hourly as many as 10,000 tweets, or entries on San Francisco-based Twitter.</p>
<p>For the last week, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, based in Palo Alto, California, has been rife with posts such as one from Zach Boswell on May 3 saying he wished more people in his high school would contract H1N1 so the school would be closed. He declined to comment further when contacted by email. A commentator using the screen name Graham Cracka saw the swine flu reports as "just another excuse by the Obama administration to institute socialized health care."</p>
<p>Recognizing Americans' increasing dependence on social network sites for information, even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has begun to Twitter.</p>
<p>The CDC made its first push to publish bulletins on high- traffic Web sites during the peanut salmonella outbreak last February that may have contributed to eight deaths.</p>
<p>The White House and the CDC recently launched official <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> pages, where they're posting frequently updated information on the swine flu, according to Matt Hicks, a spokesman for the site. CDC also has a StreamingHealth Channel on San Bruno, California-based YouTube and CDCemergency on Twitter.</p>
<p>While the CDC is unable to respond to individual questions or comments, it monitors Twitter and other social networking sites for "urban legends masquerading as news" and moves to squelch them, said Shelly Sikes Diaz, an agency spokesman.</p>
<p>A week ago Tuesday, as rumours swirled that ingesting pork can cause swine flu, the agency twittered: "CDC reminds you that you can NOT get swine flu from eating pork."</p>
<p>Twitter's format - a maximum of 140 characters per message - can make it more attractive than "weighty" scientific discourse, said Evgeny Morozov, a fellow at the Open Society Institute in New York and an expert on the Internet's political use. "Misinformed and panicking people producing more misinformation and panic" can easily drown out the government sites, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Whatever nomenclature is used -- "swine flu" or H1N1 influenza A -- the fear of its spread is discombobulating.</p>
<p>Already struggling with a sick economy, employers now must countenance a new pandemic with additional deadly financial and reputational liability.</p>
<p>Employers should nowaudit their readiness for crisis.</p>
<p>The courts require employers to provide a safe workplace.</p>
<p>If there is any hint that an employee may be a carrier and that employee is not immediately forbidden to attend work , the damages could be incalculable. A class action against such an employer by infected employees, suppliers and customers could decimate the strongest balance sheet. Apart from a lawsuit, imagine the impact of a news report on the breakout of swine flu on, say, a retail chain's business? Employers should implement policies relating to infectious diseases. Those policies must prohibit employees with any symptoms from attending the workplace and require them to seek immediatemedical attention.</p>
<p>A notice should be circulated delineating the disease's symptoms and requiring any employees experiencing them to self-report. An employee who fails to comply should be disciplined.</p>
<p>The employee should then be interviewed (by telephone or e-mail) as to who they encountered in the company during the preceding few days. Those employees, in turn, should be sent home and required to be tested immediately.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the investigation, to the extent there is a conflict, the rights of your remaining employees to a safe workplace supersede the right of the ill employee to confidentiality.</p>
<p>Some employers have voluntarily continued paying employees to remain at home if their disability benefit policies do not cover their wages, which itwillnot if the imposed absence is precautionary.</p>
<p>Other companies have prophylactically not permitted any employee who has visited Mexico from entering the workplace until the incubation period of the disease elapses. In such circumstances, it is reasonable to provide additional work after those few days so they suffer no loss of income. Ensuring their income is kept whole not only reflects legal obligations in most circumstances but also encourages sick employees to remain home rather thanrisk an outbreak.</p>
<p>While it prevents liability, the concomitant absenteeism from this approach can also be debilitating. You should have employees trained to fill key positions to protect against this eventuality.</p>
<p>Employers should also be aware of the following:</p>
<p>- Employees are generally entitled to take unpaid leave if they are sick, must care for sick family members or are quarantined. Unless there is a specific short-term disability benefit policy that covers their particular situation, there is no legal obligation to pay employees during such a leave. Benefits, however, must be continued and employees' jobs protected;</p>
<p>- If a state of emergency is declared, employees unable to work as a result are generally entitled to an unpaid leave of absence until the emergency is lifted;</p>
<p>- Employers also have a duty to accommodate. This means that if employees are able to work but must be absent from the workplace, permit them to work from home i that is practicable;</p>
<p>- Unaffected employees can be required to work overtime without consent during such an emergency.</p>
<p>But beware. Employees may, opportunistically or irrationally, use the professed fear of contagion as an excuse not to work. Do not tolerate that. Employees cannot refuse to work if their workplace is certified safe by government inspectors.</p>

<p>The Harper government is seeking clarification from China on why 27 Quebec university students have been quarantined in that country over swine flu fears, as well as why Canadian consular officials have been granted only limited access to the students.</p>
<p>The government said yesterday Canada's embassy in China will send a diplomatic note expressing "deep concern" that Canadian officials had been denied full access to the students, said a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon.</p>
<p>"We are seriously concerned ... as to why they were quarantined, because there doesn't seem to be any reason at this stage," said Deepak Obhrai, Cannon's parliamentary secretary.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization confirmed 405 new cases and four new deaths from the H1N1 swine flu yesterday, raising the global total to 1,490 cases and 31 deaths.</p>
<p>A Texas woman is the first U.S. resident to die from swine flu.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of State Health Services said the woman, who had "chronic underlying health conditions," died in Cameron County, near the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Quebec confirmed its fourth case of swine flu yesterday.</p>
<p>The provincial public health agency said the patient, from the Lanaudière region, had contracted the infection after travelling to Mexico.</p>
<p>But the infection is mild, Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's Public Health Department said at a news conference yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Three other people who contracted the H1N1 virus are also recovering, Poirier said.</p>
<p>Quebec is still on standby for a possible outbreak but for now the rate of attack is low "and that's reassuring," Poirier said.</p>
<p>There is no need to keep children home from school, said Michel Doré, an official with Quebec's Civil Security Department.</p>
<p>Doré also repeated that there's no danger to eating pork that is well cooked.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency confirmed 25 new cases of swine flu across the country, bringing the total to 165. Along with the Quebec case, 10 more were confirmed in Nova Scotia, five in Ontario, seven in British Columbia and two in Alberta.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the search continues for an explanation why a young Edmonton-area girl is the only patient in Canada with a severe case of swine flu. André Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said yesterday the girl was still in stable condition and "recovering well."</p>
<p>Corriveau speculated that pre-existing conditions such as asthma or heart problems could lead to hospitalization if combined with the flu virus. Authorities are also trying to determine where and how the girl was infected, as there is no obvious connection to Mexico, where the outbreak originated.</p>
<p>The Université de Montréal students have been sequestered in China since Saturday, when they were immediately separated from other airline passengers on arrival in Changchun.</p>
<p>Ottawa has no plans at the moment to repatriate the quarantined Canadians.</p>
<p>A Mexican plane arrived in China yesterday to take home 43 Mexicans who had also been quarantined by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry defended the quarantine of the Montrealers, saying it was in line with international and domestic law, and the students had agreed to the quarantine, Xinhua News, China's state news agency, reported.</p>
<p>The Harper government also continued its efforts to defend Canada's pork industry after several countries, including China, banned imports of Canadian pork meat.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said yesterday he had spoken with China's ambassador to Canada about the matter.</p>
<p>"As of today, he is making our plea back to Beijing to make sure that they understand the sound science and get back to dealing with good, top quality Canadian pork."</p>

</p>
<p>The politics of the swine flu or A/H1N1 outbreak are, more interesting than the epidemiology. Annually in North America somewhere between five per cent and 20 per cent of the population contracts the flu. In Canada, more than 3,500 people die each year, over 10 a day. About 20,000 are hospitalized, mostly old folks and toddlers. Recall as well that, despite the huge publicity accorded the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, fewer than 800 deaths occurred worldwide. In that context H1N1 looks pretty benign.</p>
<p>But governments and bureaucrats like to be seen doing things. And so American Vice-President, Joe Biden, well known for verbal imprudence, declared "I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now,"by which he meant planes and trains, because "when one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft."</p>
<p>He soon was corrected by White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs: "he said something on TV differently than he meant to say." Besides, air quality aboard aircraft is superior to what it is in most public buildings.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama, then gave his own eloquent advice. "Wash your hands when you shake hands; cover your mouth when you cough."The University of Calgary has followed Obama's directive and implemented an anti-flu strategy by deploying handsanitizers across campus.</p>
<p>Then Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), after announcing that the spread of the flu virus had reached Phase 5, declared that "all of humanity is under threat during the pandemic" and "this is an opportunity for global solidarity." Phase 5? Sounds pretty bad. Only one notch to go till Phase 6! And, Phase 5 had never been declared before. But then the warning system was only introduced in 2005. The fact is, all flu strains are easily transmitted so it is no big deal if the WHO raised the alert level to five.</p>
<p>More to the point, as Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at theU of A in Edmonton, put it: "a pandemic relates to geography, not severity."That is, even if H1N1 is spreading far and fast, its lethality is another issue entirely. Worse, much of the testing used to identify this strain seems to be generating a large number of false positives.</p>
<p>That is, the seriousness of the H1N1 outbreak needs to take into account virulence, which is measured as a percentage of deaths from infection. But there is hardly any reliable data. Instead, WHO(like other UN agencies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC) is happy to rely on computer models to predict bad things. Even as the flu season in the northern hemisphere is coming to an end, doomsters are predicting H1N1 will return in the fall, worse than ever.</p>
<p>Ground zero of the hysteria pandemic is WHO, a UN legacy organization inherited from the League of Nations. Like other self-perpetuating organs, WHO operatives are ever reluctant to let a crisis or even a pseudo-crisis, go to waste. This explains the malarkey about the global solidarity of all humanity. It is not enough for WHO officials simply to do their job, which is to monitor the ebb and flow of diseases across the globe. In fact, the H1N1 outbreak was discovered by <span class="companylink">Google</span> because the search engine monitors online requests for information about flu symptoms and identified a lot of Mexican inquires.</p>
<p>Instead, like unelected, unaccountable, and seldom challenged bureaucrats everywhere, WHO seems to have abandoned its modest but useful mandate to pursue utopian political objectives such as promoting a "right to health" by changing the "social and economic factors that determine people's opportunities for health." They are keen on reducing obesity, which is hardly a problem in most of the world, and promoting "health equity" through "pro-poor, gender-responsive and human-rights based" public health programs.</p>
<p>Those who love the UN will believe everything Margaret Chan says. For UN skeptics, WHO is as trustworthy as the recently concluded UN Conference on Racism or the IPCC, and for the same reasons.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Confident WestJet plans bigger fleet; Lower Profits Beat Expectations; Company says it can 'fill void' if competitor goes under</b>
</div><div>Gina Teel   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>1003 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The airline industry may be encountering some major turbulence in this recessionary environment, but <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. is still gung-ho on its growth prospects.</p>
<p>Confident enough that Canada's second-largest airline has no qualms about plans to grow its fleet to 123 aircraft through 2013, even as other legacy carriers struggle.</p>
<p>"I would suggest that maybe we're too conservative," WestJet chief executive Sean Durfy said at the company's annual meeting in Calgary on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nine more aircraft are expected this year alone, as WestJet anticipates ending 2009 with 85 aircraft.</p>
<p>Durfy said while it's tough to know what will happen to the competition and to other players an increasingly tough industry, he's certain of one thing:</p>
<p>"That we will be ready and we will deploy as much capacity as necessary to make sure that we meet the needs of the travelling public in Canada," he told the audience.</p>
<p>When later asked by an analyst in the audience what kind of scenario planning WestJet is doing should Air Canada go under, Durfy said the carrier has to stick to its strategy.</p>
<p>The answer has to be a made-in-Canada solution, he added, noting there are a lot of good organizations willing to step up, "and, of course, we are one of them."</p>
<p>"We are there to fill the void in the market if the void comes, and we'll do it as quickly and prudently as possible," Durfy responded.</p>
<p>WestJet's long-term growth game plan, meanwhile, will come from adding destinations and increasing frequencies domestically in Canada, where it makes sense.</p>
<p>Durfy noted WestJet flies to 55 different destinations but hits about 20 per cent of the potential market for its 737 aircraft.</p>
<p>That means 80 per cent of the market is open to it. This could see WestJet add six to eight U. S. destinations by 2013, along with 10 to 12 new Caribbean destinations by that same year.</p>
<p>"What this tells us, and what it shows us, is our model is a growth model, still,"Durfy said.</p>
<p>The plans are to continue to grow market share, through WestJet Vacations and commercial partnerships that boost network traffic, such as WestJet's code-share agreements with Southwest Air-lines and, in 2010,Air France, and KLM.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, WestJet posted a 29 per cent drop in first-quarter profits, as recession-wary travellers shied away from leisure and business trips and the carrier faced competition on deeply discounted fares.</p>
<p>The results still beat expectations, however.</p>
<p>WestJet reported first-quarter net earnings of $37.4 million, or diluted earnings of 29 cents per share, compared with $52.5 million, or 40 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p>The Street was looking for earnings per share of 25 cents.</p>
<p>Revenue dipped 3.3 per cent to $579.3 million, compared with $599.3 million in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p>The results buoyed WestJet's shares, which ended the day up 87 cents to close at $13.35 on the TSX.</p>
<p>"We're very proud of what we've achieved in this first quarter, given the extreme challenges that we faced," Durfy said in a conference call.</p>
<p>The challenges are set to continue, with worries about the impact of H1N1 influenza on bookings adding to the anticipated weak demand picture this year.</p>
<p>This in part saw WestJet trim its capacity outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2009.</p>
<p>WestJet is now expecting second-quarter capacity growth between one and two per cent, down from four per cent. Full-year expectations are revised to three per cent, trimmed from the previously estimated five per cent.</p>
<p>Durfy said WestJet's domestic schedule will take part of the shave, as the airline trims red-eye flights on less popular days of the week.</p>
<p>While booking velocities have come back to more nor-mal levels lately, Durfy said the current environment will impact revenue per available seat mile, or RASM, a key indicator of revenue growth.</p>
<p>Second-quarter RASM is tracking lower than in the first quarter of 2009, where declines in yield and load factor saw the measure fall 9.8 per cent to 13.30 cents.</p>
<p>Durfy said he believes the decline is a short-term pain and that WestJet will recover.</p>
<p>Airlines analyst Jacques Kavafian of <span class="companylink">Research Capital Corp</span>. is also looking for a bigger decline in RASM in the second quarter, "because there's a lot of capacity coming into the domestic market from sun destinations all at once."</p>
<p>However, he's anticipating more capacity cuts from Air Canada, which will lead to a better balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Analyst Cameron Doerksen of Versant Partners, Inc. also expects WestJet's RASM will rebound.</p>
<p>"The company still reported fairly strong earnings in a pretty brutal economic environment, so to me that points to their resilience," he said.</p>
<p>Lower fuel prices pushed cost per available seat mile down 6.4 per cent to 11.90 cents, contributing to the quarter's overall profitability, WestJet said.</p>
<p>Load factor declined 1.5 percentage points to 80.4 per cent, but Durfy said the airline is still within the full year operating model of 78 to 82 per cent.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, West-Jet reported an April load factor of 81.2 per cent, down 1.3 percentage points from the same month last year.</p>
<p>The results come on a capacity increase of 7.2 per cent and a 5.5 per cent gain in revenue passenger miles, and were boosted by Easter travel.</p>

preparing to expand its fleet to 123 planes by 2013.

</p>
<p>The fact Air Canada appears to be inching toward bankruptcy protection, for the second time since 2002, is nothing short of mind-boggling.</p>
<p>How is it that in less than five years, the country's flag carrier has managed to erase the benefits that came with a new corporate structure, including renegotiated leases, union contracts and debt obligations?</p>
<p>Even more astonishing is that it has happened during a time of economic boom.</p>
<p>Air Canada seems to be suffering from some of the same problems as the auto-makers: a lack of focus on who pays the bills--the consumer -- and legacy costs in the form of union contracts.</p>
<p>The only good news from Air Canada is that its board of directors, unlike that of <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>, actually did what it was supposed to and saw fit to ask chief executive Monte Brewer to exit stage left.</p>
<p>The fact that restructuring wizard Calin Rovinescu -- who was at Air Canada during the first round -- is now in Brewer's chair speaks volumes about where Air Canada is likely headed.</p>
<p>The sad fact is it didn't have to be this way.</p>
<p>With a restructured balance sheet, the company had a golden opportunity to taxi forward, rebrand itself as a customer-focused entity and capitalize on the challenges faced by its U. S. peers.</p>
<p>Instead, nothing much changed at Air Canada. Whether it was the menu-driven pricing, which meant that final price paid per ticket didn't have much to do with what was advertised, or the fact there was no effort on the part of the company to improve employee morale and, thus, customer service, Air Canada management didn't seem to grasp what needed to be done to ensure a healthy corporate future.</p>
<p>To anyone who regularly flies Air Canada, it's glaringly apparent that the frontline staff still don't seem to take pride in what they do.</p>
<p>The flight attendants at <span class="companylink">British Airways</span> line up to greet passengers as they board the company's Calgary flight to London's Heathrow Airport. They take pains to make sure that if passengers miss meals because they have slept, there is always something available in the back galley.</p>
<p>Stories about WestJet's customer service are well-known. And the effort that has been made in creating a strong corporate culture is paying off with customer loyalty that is showing up on the bottom line.</p>
<p>WestJet reported its first-quarter numbers Tuesday, showing its earnings fell by 29 per cent compared with the same quarter last year, but the company still beat analyst earnings per share expectations by a decent margin. It remains one of the few profitable airlines in the world.</p>
<p>WestJet, of course, is destined to do well should the country's flag carrier need to pursue a court-supervised restructuring. When Air Canada last went through the 18-month process that ended in 2004, WestJet's capacity was markedly lower than it is today.</p>
<p>Still, what's troubling is that Air Canada appears intent on making its employees pay for its inability to understand and implement the one truism in a service business: the customer always comes first.</p>
<p>Air Canada holds its annual general meeting Friday and no doubt there will be a focus on what the company's future holds, with its litany of challenges taking centre stage.</p>
<p>As things stand, Air Canada's pension plan is underfunded to the tune of $3.2 billion and, because of its cash crunch, the airline is seeking support from its unions to temporarily stop contributions.</p>
<p>If that isn't enough, Air Canada has to have $900 million in cash at the end of every month to be onside with its lease commitments.</p>
<p>It also hedged a good portion of its fuel needs at a price in the $90 US per barrel range, which means it needs to recover some of those costs, too.</p>
<p>Presumably, a portion of this hedging gaffe is being made up by the international travel fuel surcharge that continues to be charged on each travel segment. The more than $400 per ticket is getting harder to swallow in these recessionary times, not to mention the fact the surcharge is not being applied to domestic travel, leading some to wonder if it is the international traveller subsidizing those who choose to stay within North America.</p>
<p>On top of all this, people are worried about swine flu and air travel is down. Air Canada seems to be the Charlie Brown of the airline world: it's always dropping the ball.</p>
<p>But think of it this way: if the company had focused on building customer loyalty through a commitment to offering a high standard of service, which in turn would have handsomely benefited the brand, things might be different.</p>
<p>As the French playwright Moliere wrote: "Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme choses." In other words, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Sadly, a fitting description of the corporate history of Canada's flag air carrier.</p>

</p>
<p>A young Edmonton girl with swine flu who is recovering in hospital is of school age, but the province has no plans to inform parents or students at her school--sparking opposition charges that critical public information is being suppressed.</p>
<p>The criticism came on the same day a Calgary area school division revealed one of its students also had the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Education Minister Dave Hancock confirmed Tuesday the government has contacted the Edmonton school board, however, the province doesn't see the need to inform the girl's classmates or parents of students at the school.</p>
<p>Rockyview Schools, though, has apparently contradicted Hancock by informing parents at Ecole Airdrie Middle School that a student has the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"The child was in contact with people arriving back from Mexico," Angela Spanier of Rockyview Schools said Tuesday. She declined to provide any more information on the student.</p>
<p>Parents with children at the school have received letters advising them of the development and are being asked to monitor their families.</p>
<p>The school will not close, Spanier added.</p>
<p>"At this specific time it's not necessary,"she said, adding the school division worked with provincial health officials Tuesday to arrive at the decision to keep the school open.</p>
<p>In addition to stepped-up cleaning efforts on shared, hard surface areas such as door knobs and handles, the school is conducting twice-daily "flu checks."</p>
<p>Students will be screened by administrators in the morning and again in the afternoon for flu symptoms, Spanier said.</p>
<p>If a student exhibits symptoms he or she will be taken to a flu isolation room until they can be picked up.</p>
<p>Spanier doesn't expect parents to keep their children home from school today.</p>
<p>"We all need to demonstrate common sense and self-care to prevail over the uncertainty right now."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unidentified Edmonton girl is the only patient with the new H1N1 virus in Canada who has required treatment in a hospital; federal health officials have said she is the country's first serious case of illness related to swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"This is not a circumstance where it is necessary to inform others in the school,"Hancock said during question period in the legislature. "At this point, there is not an indication of risk."</p>
<p>But Liberal Leader David Swann said the lack of information about the young girl's condition and where she attends school is troubling considering schools in BritishColumbia and the United States have been closed due to fears of potential flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"This raises questions about what is being done, what is being communicated, and why parents, teachers and the public are being kept in the dark about this," said Swann, who suggested the Edmonton girl is an elementary school student.</p>
<p>The comments come as Alberta announced two new "mild"cases of swine flu in Calgary Tuesday, including a young boy whose parents had recently travelled to Mexico and a young woman who had returned from a trip to the country.</p>
<p>Canada's public health agency confirmed 25 new cases of swine flu across the country Tuesday, bringing the national total to 165.</p>
<p>Internationally, health officials have confirmed 1,490 cases and 31 deaths from the disease, including a Texas woman who is the first U. S. resident to die from swine flu.</p>
<p>The Harper government, meanwhile, is seeking clarification about why 22 Canadian university students have been quarantined in China; Canada's embassy in China plans to send a diplomatic note to China's Foreign Ministry expressing "deep concern."</p>

</p>
<p>As media outlets and health agencies across the globe race to deliver new information on the H1N1 strain of influenza, some of the intelligence found online is pure hogwash.</p>
<p>Much like the Conficker C computer virus of last month, advertisers and opportunists across the world are using fears of this newest health threat to peddle products and possibly their own viruses.</p>
<p>One e-mail circulating the Internet contains a PDF attachment called "Swine influenza frequently asked questions." Open it and your computer will be infected with a virus called Bloodhound. Exploit. 6,says IT specialist Stuart Crawford.</p>
<p>"It's a piece of malware that can grab your passwords and access to sites, and can conceivably grab files off your computer," he says. "It's preying on people's insecurities."</p>
<p>For all the impact the global swine flu is having, the fear of contracting it is even greater.</p>
<p>An Ipsos Reid poll conducted for Canwest News Services found nearly half of Canadians fear they or someone in their family might contract swine flu.</p>
<p>"If people are struck by fear, they'll buy into all sorts of things," Crawford says.</p>
<p>About five per cent of global spam volume now mentions "swine flu" to trick people to open the message, according to McAfee Security, the publishers of the popular Norton Antivirus. That accounts for between 80 and 100 billion spam messages each day, most of them with sensational subject lines such as "Salma Hayek has swine flu!" and "Swine flu in Hollywood!" These e-mails provide links to companies selling products targeting the flu strain.</p>
<p>More than 250 new websites with the words "swine flu" have been registered on the Internet thus far, according to security firm <span class="companylink">F-Secure</span>, with the number climbing.One site is selling a Swine Flu Survival Guide PDF for$19.95.Another product, called Germy Wormy, is a "a simple germ-catching arm sleeve that children can wear over their clothes to help capture viruses."</p>
<p>"You have people out there selling everything from electric blankets to herbal pills, all claiming that this is somehow going to help you,"says Craw-ford, who advises consumers use caution.</p>
<p>"They may take your credit card information and promise to send you a box of Tamiflu, never send it to you and keep your banking info.</p>
<p>"Especially in the case of pharmaceutical drugs for sale online, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is."</p>
<p>Health Canada this week warned Canadians against pur-chasing medicine that claimed to combat the virus.</p>
<p>"While there are approved antiviral drugs that may help prevent or reduce the symptoms associated with the flu in general, there are currently no products authorized for sale in Canada that are indicated specifically for the treatment of H1N1 flu virus (human swine flu)," the agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cynthia Williams with the Canadian Council of the Better Business Bureaus says the organization has not yet received any complaints from its bureaus in regards to online scams surrounding swine flu.</p>
<p>"During Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Asian tsunami scammers quickly jumped in to take advantage of people when they were desperately looking for help, and we are seeing the same thing happen in the current economic crisis," said president Douglas Simpson. "In this financial environment it is more critical than ever for consumers to guard against fraud artists and scammers working to cheat them out of their hard earned money."</p>
<p>McAfee Security also warns of other sites using the names "swine"and"flu"that are actually pushing malicious code designed to infect your computer.</p>
<p>In one case, a Russian-based site instructs the visitor to install a "video codec" to view an educational movie--this is actually another form of malicious software that puts the victim's computer at the beck and call of the attacker.</p>
<p>While most computer users would see a red flag, Crawford says only a tiny percentage need to click on a link for such an offer to be effective.</p>
<p>"The people responsible send out a million e-mails, and they get one per cent of recipients to click," he says. "You do the math. It's enough to spread a(computer) infection. Or at $10 for a cure, that quickly brings them money, or even thousands of credit card numbers."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province won't reveal school of flu victim; Critical info being suppressed: Liberal leader</b>
</div><div>Ryan Cormier and Trish Audette   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>734 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>A young Edmonton-area girl remains in hospital with swine flu but the Alberta government has no plans to inform parents or students at her school.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader David Swann said failure to do so means critical public information is being suppressed.</p>
<p>"My information is that this is an elementary student and this raises questions about what is being done, what is being communicated, and why parents, teachers and the public are being kept in the dark about this," Swann said Tuesday in the legislative assembly.</p>
<p>"Minimizing panic is important at a time like this." Swann did not say how he knew the girl attended elementary school. Previously, health authorities would not release the girl's age or even if she were old enough to go to school.</p>
<p>"I must balance the public's need to know with the sacred trust I have with these patients," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"The first step in public health is to make sure we have an accurate list of the potential contacts she might have had," Corriveau said. "This requires careful interviews with parents and other significant people. That work is still underway." Health Minister Ron Liepert said the government is following Corriveau's advice and releasing the information he suggests.</p>
<p>Education Minister Dave Hancock said the province has been in touch with the school board involved and his department is also following Corriveau's lead.</p>
<p>"The information that we're given is that this is not a circumstance where it is necessary to inform others in the school. At this point, there is not an indication of risk." Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said there would be no school closure connected to the girl's case.</p>
<p>Authorities are also trying to determine where and how the girl was infected, as there is no obvious connection to Mexico, where the outbreak originated. Neither the girl nor her family have travelled to the country.</p>
<p>The girl is the only patient in Canada to be hospitalized in connection with the outbreak. She was admitted five days ago. While she has been hit by the same strain of swine flu as others, health officials are still investigating what made her sicker than others.</p>
<p>Corriveau said the girl is still in stable condition and "recovering well." Doctors have speculated that pre-existing conditions such as asthma or heart problems could lead to hospitalization if combined with the flu virus. Last year, 161 Albertans were hospitalized with influenza. Many of those had underlying conditions that complicated their symptoms.</p>
<p>Two more human cases of the H1N1 flu virus have also been diagnosed in the province.</p>
<p>The threat of the flu and what is being done around the world to combat it is being closely watched by Grant MacEwan College after 23 Universite de Montreal students were quarantined in China.</p>
<p>Canada's stance is that there is no reason for the detainment of the students and have asked Beijing for an explanation.</p>
<p>As part of MacEwan's Asia-Pacific management program, five of its students are currently in China and another 31 are to leave in mid-May. By the end of the summer, 47 MacEwan students will be placed in practicums in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Suzhou.</p>
<p>There have been no problems with the students or plans to alter travel arrangements, college spokesman David Beharry said .</p>
<p>"These students are not on a holiday; it's part of their program. Students are fully briefed on where they are going before they go," Beharry said. "We're following the World Health Organization's recommendations and there are no travel restrictions on China." Tuesday's two new H1N1 cases are both from Calgary. One is a female young adult who spent time in Mexico. The other was a young boy whose parents travelled to the country. Both are recovering at home.</p>
<p>There have been 26 cases of the H1N1 virus in Alberta, but only a fraction of those are still active.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Preparing for the worst takes calm, common sense and citizenship</b>

</p>
<p>It increasingly appears that the Mexican flu genie is about to wreak global mischief whatever various governments decide to do or not do. So, are we now into the early stages of a world-wide pandemic? From the World Health Organization's daily updates, it appears one could be imminent -- but nobody can say for sure what the developing statistics mean.</p>
<p>Might a pandemic be as lethal as the Spanish flu of 1918 which killed as many as 50 million people? Or will it fizzle like the Swine flu of 1976, where more people died from the side effects of a hastily prepared and distributed vaccine than from the flu itself? Once again, nobody can say for sure.</p>
<p>Is the Mexican flu becoming less dangerous as it adapts to its hosts following the initial outbreak or will it subside after the first outbreak, then mutate and return with a greater lethality and virulence when the flu season begins again in the northern hemisphere, as appeared to happen in 1918? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>We've suffered through four global flu pandemics of varying intensity and three major scares over the last century. The Asiatic flu of 1889, the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu of 1958 and the Hong Kong flu of 1968 proved real. The Swine flu of 1976 and the SARS outbreak of 2003 didn't materialize as pandemics, although the Bird flu that also emerged in 2003 continues as a background concern.</p>
<p>However, at the time of writing this column, the new strain of A(H1N1) flu -- similar but not identical to the Spanish flu, which is why public health authorities are watching with such intensity -- had been reported in 21 countries and 1,124 cases had been officially confirmed by laboratory testing. Certainly enough for the epidemiologists to start taking the outbreak seriously but it's still far from clear where this is going.</p>
<p>Thus far, just to recap, we've got cases confirmed in 21 countries and 25 deaths, 24 of the mortalities occurring in Mexico, the current epicentre of the outbreak. There's been one death in the United States where the victim was a toddler with underlying health issues. There have been no deaths reported yet from Canada, Austria, China, Costa Rica, Colombia, Denmark, El Salvador, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Spain, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, which have all confirmed cases. Very small numbers of patients have had to be hospitalized with severe symptoms.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, in the annual outbreak of seasonal flu to which we've all become acclimatized as part of the cultural landscape, up to eight million Canadians are usually infected and anywhere from 4,000 to 8,000 die as a consequence.</p>
<p>Right now, because of the intense media attention, we have daily reports about every new flu case that's confirmed as the Mexican A(H1N1) strain, which tends to heighten public anxiety.</p>
<p>Yet if the same media scrutiny were applied to the roughly 180 days of a "normal" flu season, headlines would be rife with reports of up to 44,000 new cases and 44 deaths per day.</p>
<p>One of the questions we should be asking is this: Why is the one statistic frightening while the other barely registers? That's a question worthy of introspection on the part of each one of us -- because while it's easy to blame the media for overkill in the Mexican flu coverage, media generally responds to audiences and if the public has no appetite for a story, it generally gets downplayed pretty quickly.</p>
<p>One thing is certain. Self-inflated fear isn't a particularly helpful state of mind in making preparations.</p>
<p>But watchful prudence, becoming educated about what works best in prevention and protection, thinking about and discussing with family, friends and neighbours the ethical response to any emerging crisis in our own communities is more helpful than succumbing to useless worry and leaving it all to government while hoping for the best.</p>
<p>If this is, indeed, the pandemic that public health authorities have been expecting, it's going to require calm, common sense and citizenship. If it's not, consider this an opportunity to bone up on the government's pandemic plans and to think about how we should react as communities when a pandemic eventually does come, as one surely will.</p>

<p>I've heard Premier Campbell saying we must remain calm in light of the swine flu (a.k.a. H1N1) that is sweeping the world. I would like to know what steps he and the provincial health officer have taken to instruct Elections BC on how to combat the transmission of such a deadly flu next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Will the doors of polling stations be propped open, eliminating the need to clean the knobs between uses? Will the instrument with which we mark our ballots -- the common, ordinary stubby pencil -- have to be sanitized between uses or will they come shrink-wrapped, one per voter? Will there be signs posted saying, "Do not put pencil to mouth when deep in thought"?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WestJet scales back plans; Q1 earnings decline 29%</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

<p>The airline industry's challenges finally caught up with <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. during the first quarter, driving down its earnings by nearly 29 per cent and forcing it to scale back its growth plans for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>While management said they expect to turn a profit in the second quarter, weakening demand for air travel continued to force it to cut fares in order to fill planes. The recent outbreak of swine flu in Mexico has only exacerbated that situation, management added.</p>
<p>"The second quarter is shaping up to be an interesting time. When it rains, it sure pours," Sean Durfy, WestJet chief executive, said in a conference call. "The economy isn't showing signs of an upswing and the recent H1N1 influenza virus is hitting the psyche of the travelling public hard."</p>
<p>While the airline's bookings appear to be recovering somewhat this week, Durfy said it was too early to quantify the impact of the flu outbreak on the airline's revenue per available seat miles, or RASM - an important gauge of the airline's profitability. Even without it, though, management said they expect RASM to fall at least 10 per cent in the second quarter because of pricing pressure. That is down from its previous forecast of a 6.5-per-cent decline. The declines, however, will be offset somewhat by lower fuel costs during the quarter, management noted.</p>
<p>WestJet stock jumped nearly seven per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday to close at $13.35. Those gains were made in part because WestJet's first-quarter earnings of $37.4 million, or 29 cents a share, beat the Street's estimates of 22.5 cents a share.</p>
