<p>With the recession hitting the United States harder than Canada, and the Canadian dollar still strong, this may be a great time for Canadians to buy that sunny, tranquil getaway in the U. S. or farther south. But to make sure it is tranquil, do your due diligence, just like you would at home.</p>
<p>Tom Kelly, a syndicated columnist based in Washington state, has co-authored two books about buying real estate in Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>He believes prices in those areas will go up once American baby boomers recover some of their wealth.</p>
<p>U. S. boomers weren't prepared for the economic downturn and once they rebuild, they are going to look for a cheaper lifestyle. And it's definitely cheaper in Mexico and Central America, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Canadians, on the other hand, haven't been as hard hit and were better prepared, he said. So they are in a better position to buy now.</p>
<p>"And the further you go, typically the less expensive it's going to be," Kelly said.</p>
<p>Panama, for example, "is a bargain right now," Kelly said. "But it costs money to get there."</p>
<p>And while Puerto Vallarta and other places in Mexico are easier to get to, deals can be found there, too, because not as many people are buying, he said. The outbreak of H1N1 flu in the spring turned some people off. And the rash of drug-related crime did too, Kelly said.</p>
<p>But Kelly believes Mexico is perfectly safe, with the violence limited to the drug trade near the border. "There's no history of these people targeting nonnationals," Kelly said.</p>
<p>Mexico is also safe from a purchasing perspective with title insurance now available to those buying property, he said.</p>
<p>A lot of the horror stories of people buying in Mexico and ending up with nothing really stemmed from "nonnationals buying property they should have never bought in the first place because nobody owned the title to it," Kelly said.</p>
<p>For financing, it's cheaper to remortgage your Canadian property and buy with cash than get local financing. While there are international banks that will lend you money, they will charge more, he said.</p>
<p>David Ingram is a North-Vancouver-based former real estate agent who has made a career out of advising Canadians who want to buy property outside the country, and foreigners who want to buy property in Canada. About 6,000 people attended his seminars last year.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is, every country, and every state, is different, he said. So get the advice you need to learn the rules before you buy.</p>
<p>Photo: John Chalmers, Edmonton Journal / There may be good
buys on properties in Mexican cities such as Acapulco as demand has
fallen, experts say.

<p>The decision to be vaccinated against influenza must remain the personal choice of each Canadian, including those on the front lines of health care. A free society demands nothing less. That said, those who wish to take such preventive action should have access to the vaccines if they so desire.</p>
<p>The announcement by our chief medical officer Dr. Andre Corriveau that Albertans will be provided two free vaccines beginning this fall is welcome news. Designed to offer protection from three strains of seasonal flu as well as the dread H1N1 virus, the program's universal availability--as opposed to being restricted to so-called high-risk groups--is not only reassuring, but also sound public health policy. The latest swine-flu contagion, for example, has sometimes eluded the stereotypes, striking down younger, normally healthy victims.</p>
<p>Indeed, an average of 30 Albertans perish each year from seasonal flus. As Corriveau reminded Thursday, "it's not a benign disease." As well, four deaths have been linked to H1N1 here, with 55 nationwide and over 300 in the U. S. He reported that his office is keeping a close watch on the spread of swine flu in the Southern Hemisphere, adding that the virus has slowed down somewhat in Alberta for now, compared with the peak month of June.</p>
<p>Health professionals expect a serious spike in cases beginning next fall and continuing through the winter. The new vaccine, expected to be available locally in November, will be offered first to those in the highest risk categories and widely distributed via public health clinics, doctor's offices and pharmacies, along with some workplaces. Corriveau hopes most Albertans will take advantage of the program now and in the future, maintaining that seasonal flu shots offer protection on the order of 70 per cent of those inoculated and lessen the severity of the illness for those who catch the bug.</p>
<p>The province's $8-million budget for the seasonal flu vaccine in 2009-10 is a wise investment by any reckoning. At a time when the travails and intrigues of the provincial health-care system seem to be the headlines nearly every week, it's particularly timely and pleasant to mark an occasion when things actually seem to working on all cylinders.</p>
<p>As Corriveau observed, "We're doing it because it's the right thing to do." All of us can agree on that for a change.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia reported its first death linked to swine flu Friday after a woman who had the virus succumbed to her health conditions.</p>
<p>The woman was in her 50s and had other underlying health problems in addition to swine flu.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the virus, Nova Scotia has had 456 confirmed cases, resulting in the hospitalization of 10 people since late April.</p>
<p>There have now been 56 confirmed deaths linked to H1N1 in Canada.</p>

<p>When my husband went to pick up my Tamiflu prescription, the pharmacist read it, recoiled, then demanded that he step back and wipe alcohol wash over his hands. You discover quickly, when swine flu hits, that few people's reactions make sense.</p>
<p>Like most of us, I had been scanning the reports of a pandemic with increasing alarm. I have three children, the youngest under five, and vulnerable, elderly relatives. I wanted, selfishly, to hear of "underlying health problems," not unexplained deaths. I sent up silent prayers that it would bypass our postcode.</p>
<p>I ascribed the fact that I had felt vaguely unwell for days to the race towards the end of term, with its myriad tasks and work deadlines. But last Sunday, after taking my daughter to a horse show, I found I could not get up from the sofa. "Is it cold in here?" I asked. "Er, no," my husband said, shifting a few inches away from me. I put it down to exhaustion.</p>
<p>When it hit properly later that evening, there was little doubt. My temperature soared, I shivered under a blanket in front of the TV. I was convinced that my face was striped grey and red. My husband stated, reassuringly, that I was just "strangely blotchy."</p>
<p>On Monday morning, in true parent-in-the-holidays fashion, I made myself get up, as if by behaving normally I could make my body believe it. Fat chance. By lunchtime I was huddled in bed, waiting for my doctor to call back.</p>
<p>He ran through my symptoms: fever, cough, headache, streaming cold, aching bones, and said -- in the manner of someone who had repeated this conversation 108 times already -- "I think we'll treat you. Get someone to pick up some Tamiflu for you."</p>
<p>When he added that the first 48 hours were as bad as it was likely to get, I was reassured. I wasn't going to die of swine flu. I just had to sweat it out. But once I knew that, I also felt oddly fraudulent.</p>
<p>Our GP reassured me that giving me Tamiflu did not mean we were depriving an immuno-compromised baby somewhere. More importantly, he said, it would make me less likely to infect anyone else.</p>
<p>And that has been my main concern since. My children hover daily at the bedroom door asking "if I still have bugs" (youngest), and, with greater concern, "um -- shall we not tell any of my friends that you have swine flu, Mum?" (eldest).</p>
<p>She is right to be anxious. A flurry of calls ensued as the news got around. Was it true? Playdates with my children were cancelled abruptly, despite me pointing out that a) they didn't have it and b) you can only catch it from someone who is symptomatic.</p>
<p>Our babysitter and cleaner had good reasons for being fearful -- both care for immuno-compromised children -- but others' reactions seemed a little extreme. My husband jokes that he has checked every morning for the big red cross to appear on our front door, and my bedroom has been nicknamed the Plague Pit.</p>
<p>As I write this, I feel I am improving, though I'm exhausted in that peculiarly post-viral way. The Tamiflu may have helped. It's impossible to know how bad I would have felt without it, and it was certainly reassuring to feel that I was doing something. E-mail and my laptop have kept me sane.</p>
<p>Though swine flu isn't fun, I have had worse, and I suspect the majority of people who catch it will feel the same way. The ones I know of who have really suffered with it have contracted other things simultaneously: tonsillitis, or gastroenteritis. If it weren't for the porcine label, I would have just accepted my case as summer flu.</p>
<p>Worse than the physical discomfort was the fleeting sense of being a pariah, the panic in people's voices when they called (although I can highly recommend it for getting rid of door-to-door salesmen -- one of them practically galloped off my front step). Perhaps I would have been just as fearful but I'd like to think not.</p>
<p>Oddly, as more of our neighbours have contracted it, local hysteria levels finally seem to be lessening. Widespread infection, perversely, may be the only thing that calms us down. As in the worst horror films, it's the unknown that is most terrifying.</p>

<p>As Ottawa's emergency planners try to mobilize hundreds of family physicians for a possible surge in flu cases this fall, it's unclear how many of the city's doctors have followed provincial guidelines to stockpile enough protective equipment to get them through a potential pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's definitely an unknown, and this is why we're working so aggressively," said Thomas Hayes, who chairs a committee of emergency planners from area hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care providers.</p>
<p>The committee, along with the city's public-health officials, is working with representatives of Ottawa's 800 family physicians on a detailed plan to assess and treat patients should there be a flu pandemic this fall.</p>
<p>The plan is based on the assumption that the health-care system must be prepared to respond to all types of flu because officials are no longer doing large-scale diagnostic tests to determine whether patients have the seasonal flu strains, or the H1N1 swine flu virus.</p>
<p>During the 2003 SARS outbreak centred in Toronto, the Ontario government sent every physician in the province a starter kit containing samples of protective masks, gloves, gowns and hand sanitizers to reduce their risk of infection when treating patients.</p>
<p>Since then, the province has established a pandemic plan that urges all health-care providers to keep, at their own expense, at least a month's supply of protective gear and antiviral drugs to cope during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Public health officials say they are attempting to gauge the number of physicians who have built up and kept such a stockpile.</p>
<p>"We'll at least have some kind of qualitative assessment of what's out there and how we can support them in getting what they need," said Dr. Nadine Sicard, associate medical officer of health for the City of Ottawa.</p>
<p>So far, the degree of readiness among Ottawa physicians seems to vary, with some appearing more prepared than others.</p>
<p>The Appletree Medical Group, which runs 11 primary-care clinics across the city, estimates its 120 physicians could screen and triage up to 700 patients a day during a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The group has told emergency planners that if needed, it has the capacity to set up a flu assessment and treatment clinic within 48 hours of being notified.</p>
<p>Appletree also has a comprehensive electronic-health system, including a website and hotline, that allows patients to find clinics in the city with the shortest wait times. When patients arrive at the clinics, they can use electronic kiosks to self-register and self-triage, giving doctors an immediate picture of which patients have flu-like symptoms and need to be isolated.</p>
<p>Such tools are designed to allow the clinics to run even if a pandemic leaves support staff sick and unable to work, said Dr. Thom Tyson, president of Appletree.</p>
<p>"Our resources have been built over the past decade that connect all our practices and allow them to continue running, even during a worst-case scenario," Tyson said.</p>
<p>But Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, president of the Academy of Medicine Ottawa, which represents a majority of the city's family physicians, said not all physicians are willing and able to respond during a pandemic.</p>
<p>"Each family doctor would need to decide for him- or herself what level of care or access they are comfortable in providing," said Fullerton, a Kanata family physician.</p>
<p>"Some physicians may be pregnant or have chronic conditions that could make H1N1 particularly threatening to them. Others may have young families and be reluctant to bring home the virus."</p>
<p>Fullerton favours having flu patients sent not to their own family doctors, but to dedicated flu assessment and treatment clinics.</p>
<p>"This makes good sense because it keeps family doctors seeing their other patients in their clinics and prevents the co-mingling of patients with H1N1 with other patients in the office," said Fullerton.</p>
<p>A 2004 study of the city's family doctors, conducted a year after the outbreak of SARS respiratory illness panicked public-health authorities, suggested a majority felt they were not ready to cope during a flu pandemic. Of the 250 family doctors who responded to the survey, half described themselves as being unprepared, while another third said they were unsure.</p>
<p>Even so, three-quarters of the physicians who responded to the survey indicated they were willing to pitch in during a flu emergency by immunizing patients, or assessing and treating them.</p>
<p>Dr. William Hogg, the study's lead author, said much has changed since the survey was conducted. In particular, public-health officials have started a registry of Ottawa-area family doctors and actively share information with them -- a relationship that did not exist during the SARS epidemic.</p>
<p>Hogg advocates the creation of a citywide network of physicians, nurses and other primary-care providers that would work together, especially when it comes to emergency planning.</p>

</p>
<p>Ottawa's chief medical officer of health Dr. Isra Levy has been worried for some time that the citizenry is not taking the H1N1 flu as seriously as it should.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some people and organizations are starting to get the message, and to engage in proper planning. H1N1 could cause 35 per cent of the city to fall ill this fall and winter, possibly in a six- to eight-week period. The virus has seriously disrupted some summer camps, providing a glimpse of what could happen to the general population during flu season.</p>
<p>Schools will likely be major incubators, yet, strangely, it seems that of the four local boards only the Ottawa Catholic School Board has a detailed plan in place to deal with the pandemic. The other three boards had best hurry to develop a course of action before September.</p>
<p>In addition to the Catholic school board, the Ottawa Police Service has wisely tried to get in front of H1N1, drawing up plans to ensure that the city will continue to have reliable law enforcement even if large numbers of officers and support staff fall ill.</p>
<p>The biggest employer in the region must also be alert and ready, and that is the federal government. During the last two emergencies in the Ottawa area, the ice storm and the blackout, the federal government seemed one step behind. Other employers and businesses in the national capital region need to ensure that they'll be able to stay open and functioning in the event of a local outbreak.</p>
<p>There has been lots of advance warning on this one, from Dr. Levy and others. No one should be caught unprepared.</p>

</p>
<p>Water issues</p>
<p>Some regions (such as the Middle East) are likely to experience marked reductions in rainfall and river flows. Others, which rely on glaciers for fresh water, will face challenges as they melt faster than predicted. This will reduce the availability of water for drinking and industry. Conversely, other regions may gain easier access to fresh water.</p>
<p>Rising sea levels</p>
<p>Low-lying territories are likely to face increased instances of flooding which may threaten the territorial integrity of some low-lying island chains. Major coastal cities (and critical infrastructure) are also at risk from wide-scale and repeated flooding.</p>
<p>Health and pandemics</p>
<p>Climate change is a health risk, primarily as it will make pandemics more likely. This is caused not only by a rise in natural disasters but also changing weather patterns which will shift the location of where certain disease vectors can exist. It will also increase instances of heat-related mortality.</p>
<p>Food security</p>
<p>It is predicted rising temperatures will harm global food production (this at the same time as world population rises). Some regions may see a medium term production increase but the global trend will be down.</p>
<p>Natural disasters</p>
<p>Predicting natural disasters is difficult and fraught with risk.</p>
<p>However, the warming of the world's oceans is likely to prompt an increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones, presenting risk to critical infrastructure (particularly in developing nations).</p>
<p>Polar ice cap reduction</p>
<p>The polar ice masses are predicted to shrink decade by decade. This may create territorial tensions, particularly between</p>
<p>Arctic rim states as it becomes profitable to extract seabed resources that were previously inaccessible.</p>
<p>How countries react</p>
<p>The nations most at risk from the effects of dangerous climate change are often those which are the least developed, raising questions about their capability and capacity to cope. The affected populations may resort to migration and a wide range of predictions have been made about the likely number of global environmental refugees on the move by the 2050s: ranging from 50 million to 200 million refugees.</p>
<p>Also at risk</p>
<p>Large, developing countries. How India, China and Pakistan, for example, manage together a potentially dwindling water supply from the melting Himalayas glaciers will have a major impact on regional security. The same is true for Middle East countries such as Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<div>1747 words</div><div>25 July 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Have you observed that a Montreal magistrate has just sentenced a man to pay a fine of $5 with the option of going to jail for a month for spitting in a streetcar?</p>
<p>The general verdict everywhere on this action will be "well done." Too long have human brutes been allowed to make nuisances of themselves in this respect, and it would be well if similar action were taken here in Ottawa, where, like Montreal and elsewhere, delicate women and children have to run the risk, every day, of contracting disease, owing to this beastly and disgusting habit.</p>
<p>Purity, Ottawa</p>
<p>Excerpt from a letter published in the Citizen, May 23, 1901.</p>
<p>When Purity's letter was printed more than a century ago, the penalty for spitting on streetcars was not insignificant. Five dollars in 1901 is equivalent to slightly more than $125 in 2009, while a month in jail at the turn of the last century would still be akin to 30 days.</p>
<p>Today, however, to judge by a letter in this paper earlier this month, the discharge of slaver on public transit, despite the awareness of what diseases -- H1N1, included -- saliva can transmit, wouldn't land you within spitting distance of a courtroom, let alone a jail cell.</p>
<p>While on an OC Transpo bus to his Kanata home, Jim Taggart saw a teen spit on a seat. A fellow passenger notified the driver, who spoke to the offender but allowed him to return to his spot.</p>
<p>When Taggart reached his stop, he asked why security had not been summoned. "Well, he's gone now," the driver replied.</p>
<p>"Great," Taggart wrote. "So OC Transpo is pasting signage all over the interior of the fleet, informing passengers about the need for respect and no foul language, etc. But as for spitting on a seat, well, that teen got away with a disgusting act."</p>
<p>OC Transpo's bylaws forbid expectorating on buses, trains and property. The $150 fine, though, is levied fewer than 10 times a year in part because transit enforcement officers must actually see the act. "They have to witness the spit," explains OC Transpo's chief special constable Kim Weston-Martin.</p>
<p>"But it happens," she adds, noting that a man was fined following KISS's recent Bluesfest performance. "This intoxicated individual found it humorous to hork all over the bus, over and over again. It just so happened we had a couple of officers riding that bus."</p>
<p>Additionally, OC Transpo may act as a third party to charge someone with criminal assault for spitting on another. "We've laid a number of criminal charges for spitting on other people," Weston-Martin says. Typically, though, she notes that fists are used more often than saliva to solve arguments.</p>
<p>Of course, public transit is only one place where spitting occurs. Citizen reader Pat Beaudry wrote this month of a minor traffic squabble that was "resolved" when a bicyclist spat on his windshield.</p>
<p>"There's something very wrong with that kind of behaviour in a civilized society," said Beaudry.</p>
<p>Ottawa's various municipalities formerly had spitting bylaws -- brought about by public concern over tuberculosis. But after amalgamation in 2001 when bylaws were harmonized, the one forbidding spitting was dropped (although, fortunately, the ones disallowing public urination and defecation remain on the books).</p>
<p>Does Ottawa need to return to punitive days? The city of Kingston has drawn up a regulations to ban spitting on sidewalks or in buildings, stairways or passageways. Is spitting in public becoming as big a problem as, say, breaches of cellphone etiquette? Do Canadians' expectorations approach the level of those in China, where, in a pre-Olympic crackdown, authorities in Beijing held that city's first No Spitting Day to inform residents that "spitting kills even more than an atomic bomb?"</p>
<p>According to Suzanne Nourse, public spitting is nowhere near as prevalent here as it is in China (where she recalls a waiter once serving her tea while using a spittoon -- "At least he was using a spittoon. That was a step up"), but she warns we're on the downside of a slippery, gooey slope.</p>
<p>"It's a disgusting habit, and one that we are becoming more casual and lax about as a society," says the founder of the Protocol School of Ottawa. "It's creeping in. We are ignoring it more, and therefore it is becoming more -- I hate to use the word acceptable, but people are getting away with it more because nothing is being done about it."</p>
<p>It's impossible to state definitively whether we're in a bull or bear market when it comes to public spitting; it's not the sort of thing tracked by Statistics Canada or pollsters.</p>
<p>(From her observations, however, Nourse believes public spitting is only gaining in popularity among men, and that women only spit publicly as a gesture of contempt.)</p>
<p>Even if data were kept, its reliability might be questionable. A 2007 study at China's Renmin University found that 2.5 per cent of Beijing residents spat in public -- which suggests many people are reluctant to admit to the practice, or even be conscious they do it.</p>
<p>Nourse also notes that many people are unaware there's anything wrong with it. "People just don't know, and it becomes such a habit. I wish I could speak to the parents who are totally oblivious to it, because this involves their child's future."</p>
<p>Nourse says education -- not legislation -- is the way to reverse the waterfall of spittle.</p>
<p>"We used to teach this in school, and it was reinforced at home," she says. "It's like a lot of other things -- we see people flossing their teeth in a restaurant, using a sugar packet, or excavating in their mouth with a finger. No one wants to see that. There's a little room down the hall for that."</p>
<p>Also, a preponderance of professional athletes spitting, including the hockey players many Canadian youngsters worship, hasn't helped. Tiger Woods's habit of spraying the course with more than just <span class="companylink">Nike</span> golf balls has turned a spotlight onto the unsavoury side of a game that prides itself on its gentility. "Now I even notice little children -- eight years old -- spitting, trying to emulate the big kids," says Nourse, "and they haven't even mastered the art of spitting."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>What's remarkable is how public spitting has, in a relatively short time, become a socially enforced inhibition. As recently as the mid-1800s, spitting was considered necessary for one's health because it disposed of bodily excrement.</p>
<p>Yet, as author Margaret Visser notes in her 1994 book, The Way We Are, spitting, while historically tolerated, has always been regulated. "For more than 2,000 years we have been taught to recoil from slimy substances," she wrote. "Ours is a culture that is unusually determined to distinguish between liquid and solid. We easily dislike anything that falls between the two categories, especially if the substance is bodily: tears, freely running, are fine; spit or snot, which we describe as runny, are not."</p>
<p>(This helps explain punk's affinity for "gobbing" in the 1970s, in which fans and practitioners of the music form that embraces rebellion regularly spat upon one another -- punk rocker Siouxsie Sioux contracted conjunctivitis after a fan spat in her eye, while Clash frontman Joe Strummer blamed hepatitis on a fan's phlegm.)</p>
<p>With concerns over tuberculosis and other diseases rampant, spitting's popularity nose-dived by the early 1900s. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 prompted the City of Ottawa to urge residents to refrain from spitting. By the mid-1900s, signs asking the public to refrain from spitting on buses or in or near buildings were no longer posted routinely, the rationale being that people no longer needed to be told.</p>
<p>With H1N1 rippling across the globe, though, we are reminded of reasons not to spit beyond simple politesse. "It's considered a biological fluid, so yes, there's a possibility of transmission of various communicable diseases," says Dr. Nadine Sicard, the city's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Among those diseases, she says, are hepatitis B and C, meningitis and influenza such as H1N1.</p>
<p>"For that to happen," she notes, "you need direct contact with secretions that have that microbe in them. So that could be some spit or mucous, or even droplets when someone's coughing next to you, on your mouth or face."</p>
<p>Foreign saliva can be transferred errantly by hand, making washing important. "If you touch spit and wash your hands and then touch your face, that wouldn't be a problem," Sicard says. "If it's on the floor or ground, that would not be an issue for most adults. But if you're talking about young children, that might be another story."</p>
<p>Suzanne Nouse wonders if people who spit in public also spit on their floors at home. "If not," she asks, "then why do they think it's acceptable on the streets where everyone else walks?"</p>
<p>I would like to call your attention and that of your readers to a most objectionable and disgusting habit which many men in this city have of spitting from windows of offices and other upstairs rooms over stores, etc., along the main streets.</p>
<p>Walking along Sparks and Rideau streets today I had to dodge a spit from some upper window no less than three times.</p>
<p>I fully realize that men cannot be stopped from spitting, but surely some measures ought to be taken to prevent them doing it from the windows along public throughfares.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Desperate union takes giant gamble</b>

</p>
<p>By midnight tomorrow, Toronto could be nearing the end of the five-week-old civic strike or hopelessly adrift, without an apparent solution.</p>
<p>It's a gamble worth embracing - a giant risk undertaken by desperate union leaders whose members are wilting on the picket lines.</p>
<p>In a bold move that calls the city's bluff and turns the pressure on the mayor, union leader Mark Ferguson has in effect told Mayor David Miller to put up or shut up.</p>
<p>Settle with the 30,000 striking workers by midnight tomorrow or union negotiators are walking away from contract talks to camp out with the strikers on the picket line.</p>
<p>"I'm a patient man but I'm close to the end of my rope," Ferguson said. Then, he added Miller's own words: "Enough is enough."</p>
<p>Well, that's good. Nothing else seems capable of moving city hall and its striking unions close to a settlement. Rank-and-file workers have begun crossing the picket lines to head back to work, weakening the union's hands. Non-union managers are stressed to exhaustion, working round the clock to keep the city afloat. Keeping them buoyant, when just months ago the mayor froze their salaries and disrespected their contribution, is a growing concern.</p>
<p>And the public is furious at both sides.</p>
<p>Besides, concerns about the city's health - the big wild card in any civic strike - are surfacing daily. Yesterday, the city confirmed ambulance delays are a minute greater since the strike and responses to medical emergencies have fallen below acceptable levels. Give us more ambulances and paramedics, they are pleading in court.</p>
<p>Last week, the region's flu expert warned of more deaths from swine flu because of the strike.</p>
<p>And temporary garbage dumps proliferate, each one adding to the chorus of protests and anger from affected neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Miller moved quickly late yesterday to leave the impression he is just as eager as Ferguson to end the strike.</p>
<p>Putting his spin on the Ferguson ultimatum, Miller issued a statement which says, "I am pleased that Local 416 will now bring that sense of urgency to the table," adding the city will bargain 24 hours a day to reach a settlement.</p>
<p>It's the only thing he could say. For weeks, Miller voiced frustration at the slow progress of talks. The unions "must find a way to say yes," he repeated at each news conference. Now he may have to.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago he publicly released the city's latest offer, a controversial move that angered the unions and elicited charges of "bargaining in bad faith."</p>
<p>If the strategy worked to produce a flurry of exchanges of offers and proposals, it has not produced a deal. A new push is needed.</p>
<p>The union has made a counter offer to the city's publicized offer. City officials have had it for two weeks. We know the city is offering 1 per cent, 1 per cent, 2 per cent, 3 per cent over four years. The unions started out asking for 3 per cent per year. We also know the city wants to yank away the coveted sick-benefit plan that can give a retiring worker up to six months' payout for accumulated sick days.</p>
<p>At issue is how to compensate the union for ending this benefit. Miller is offering a percentage of the amounts the workers have accumulated over the years. The unions, no doubt, claim the workers earned it all.</p>
<p>Clearly, both sides are aching for an out. It could be another two months or more before public health concerns are great enough to trigger back-to-work legislation from the province.</p>
<p>Many union and political careers - not to mention mortgages - are riding on the outcome.</p>

<div>PITY THE COTTAGEOCRACY</div>
<div>Globe Style</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Muskoka's sodden summer of discontent</b>
</div><div>LEAH McLAREN   </div>
<div>875 words</div><div>25 July 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L3</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>lmclaren@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>If Toronto is the most detested city in the country and the super-rich its most loathed minority, then surely the upmarket lake district of Muskoka wins the annual summer sweepstakes for the most hated place in Canada.</p>
<p>Having said that, I love it up here.</p>
<p>I did not grow up with a cottage. But my boyfriend's family has one, and in recent years I have come to appreciate its charms. What's not to like about a little log cabin in the woods on a quiet bay? I know that admitting this will not win me any friends among the cottage-less majority. Cottages are a privilege, after all. They are also like awards: ostentatious and useless, until you have one, in which case they're the best thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>The backlash against the cottageocracy has been simmering for years, but in these times of economic crisis, it is stronger than ever. “Must be nice” is the most civil response I get when telling friends I'm going to the cottage for the rest of the summer to write. The more common one, I'm afraid, is unfit to print.</p>
<p>But hold your hate mail – this year, the Ontario cottageocracy doesn't deserve your envy, but the opposite. This is the summer of our discontent.</p>
<p>I arrived last week to the news that Muskoka had been struck down by a swine-flu outbreak. More than 200 children at several camps in the region had been diagnosed with the highly contagious, occasionally fatal virus. There were more cases of swine flu in Muskoka than in all of Britain – a cruel irony for someone who had crossed the ocean in the hope of “getting away from it all” in the Canadian wilderness.</p>
<p>Like everywhere, the economy up here is feeling the pinch. The monster-cottage market is drooping as people opt to offload the private island rather than yank the kids out of private school. The result? A market correction, in which you can pick up a fully winterized Cape Cod-style lakefront getaway with clay courts and two boathouses for the bargain price of $2.8-million (annual property taxes roughly equivalent to a nurse's salary).</p>
<p>Yes, it's the summer of the bargain hunter. “We're certainly down in dollar volume,” said Donna Reid of Royal LePage Lakes of Muskoka Realty. “The only people buying in a market like this have been waiting in the wings for a long time … but it's a correction, so what can you expect?”</p>
<p>Of course, all of these concerns pale in comparison with the real crisis on cottagers' minds this summer, and that is the weather.</p>
<p>According to everyone I've run into, it's been one of the rainiest, coldest, most solidly miserable Julys on record. Not really a July at all. “Welcome to Junuary,” my aunt recently grumbled. “Before that it was Juvember.”</p>
<p>The weather might not matter so much to those with oceanview cabins, but let's face it: Without the sun, most Ontario cottages are damp suburban bungalows on the edge of a weed-choked lake.</p>
<p>The Australian visitors staying in our guest bunkie had been here for a whole sopping week when we arrived. Having been lured halfway around the globe by tales of glorious summers and cocktails on the dock (“docktails,” as I like to call them), they understandably looked put out.</p>
<p>“There hasn't been one nice day,” the mother told me as her bored 12-year-old son lolled on the sofa watching cartoons. We sat in silence watching freezing rain bounce off the porch screen and I felt a perverse wave of patriotism. “I'm so sorry,” I said, as if to prove I was Canadian, and, “Can I get you another beer?”</p>
<p>Penny Caldwell, editor-in-chief of Ontario-based Cottage Life magazine, is not surprised at this summer's wave of misery.</p>
<p>“People don't think they're going to get swine flu at the cottage,” she said when I called her up to chat (it was raining – there wasn't much else to do). “They go there to get away from that stuff and relax. If it's cold and rainy, you can't go in the water, the kids can't catch frogs, you can't go in the boat and the bugs are worse.”</p>
<p>This sodden season has been brightened only by the local gossip that Kate Hudson brought A-Rod home to meet the parents: A friend of mine recently saw the Yankees third baseman golfing with Goldie Hawn and Martin Short at Muskoka Lakes Golf and Country Club – a thrilling and random group celebrity sighting if there ever was one.</p>
<p>Add to this evidence that the eyesore development of 200 condos and a “waterfront recreation centre” planned for next door appears to be on hold.</p>
<p>Maybe global pandemics and economic crises are good for something after all. And guess what? The sun just came out. Think I'll grab a towel and fix myself a docktail. But before you start slagging off the cottageocracy, remember: It'll probably rain tomorrow.</p>

<p>Re: Fighting Back: What the Flu?, July 23.</p>
<p>Contrary to information in the preface of this article, Tamiflu is not a vaccine -- it is an oral antiviral medication proven effective in both the treatment and post-exposure prevention of influenza in adults and children one year and older. It is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment and prevention of an influenza pandemic. Given that vaccine is unlikely to be available for the early months of a pandemic, the WHO has advised that antivirals will be the only virus-specific intervention available during the initial pandemic response.</p>
<p>Five confirmed cases of Tamiflu resistance have been identified around the world, but this does not mean that the currently circulating pandemic (H1N1) virus is resistant to Tamiflu. A certain amount of Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 virus can be expected in patients exposed to the drug as either a treatment or as prevention, and the WHO and U. S. Centers of Disease Control have not changed their recommendations.</p>

<p>Local schools are preparing for a potential increase in swine flu cases this fall by implementing precautionary measures and protocols in case of a pandemic during the new school year.</p>
<p>The public and Catholic school boards say they've got plans to deal with a possible H1N1 virus outbreak and prevent the spread of the flu if students or staff catch the virus.</p>
<p>Both boards will rely on the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit to declare a health crisis or a pandemic and to direct the appropriate response to it. But they have also outlined a number of their own measures amid experts' warnings about a "second wave" of the flu this fall.</p>
<p>Gary McKenzie, the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board's risk assessment manager, said hand sanitizers have been placed throughout the region's Catholic schools. Posters encouraging proper handwashing have also been put up.</p>
<p>McKenzie said the school board also has "enhanced" cleaning procedures, "should we need to blitz a building, so to speak."</p>
<p>A communication plan is in place to inform staff, students and parents of any swine flu cases or an outbreak. If a staff member catches the flu or has children who are sick, he or she will be able to work from home, McKenzie said.</p>
<p>Warren Kennedy, director of education for the Greater Essex County District School Board, said the board has guidelines in place to respond to a "national health risk," under direction from the health unit.</p>
<p>"There is planning around essential services and preventive measures, such as handwashing," he said. "If the health unit advises us that we have a national health risk, there are procedures in place we will follow to ensure there's no chaos or confusion.</p>
<p>"We have our fingers crossed."</p>
<p>Concerning the availability of the H1N1 vaccine for school children, Kennedy said the school board is still waiting to hear any news about how inoculation will be handled in Canada.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is working on a vaccine priority list, deciding who should get the injections first.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>CONFIRMED CASES</p>
<p>So far, there have been 45 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus in Windsor-Essex County, involving 22 males and 23 females.</p>
<p>They range in age from four months to 56 years, and the greatest number of cases involves people between the ages of 15 and 24, the Windsor-Essex County Health unit says.</p>
<p>Five of the 45 infected people required hospitalization, but all have since been released.</p>
<p>As of July 11, there have been more than 3,800 lab-confirmed swine flu cases across Ontario.</p>
<p>So far, there have been 50 swine flu-related deaths in Canada.</p>

</p>
<p>School boards are spending the summer fine-tuning pandemic plans in preparation for the return of students in September and are even considering the worst-case scenario prospect of closing schools if too many students and staff are absent because of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We have a process in place in the event that we need to have school closures," Mark Joel, a superintendent with the Durham District School Board, said yesterday.</p>
<p>School boards are working in conjunction with local public health units on pandemic plans.</p>
<p>Contained in the plans are "trigger points" for stepping up responses. For example, if 20 per cent of students or staff are absent at a Durham school, public health would be notified and consideration would be given to closing the facility, Joel said. This is similar to the plans of other GTA boards.</p>
<p>"We would then look at whether we could safely manage the kids or not and whether public health wanted to close down to stop the spread or an outbreak," Joel said.</p>
<p>There has been much international debate over the value of closing schools in a pandemic. The World Health Organization has said the measure could help slow the spread of the virus, but noted the decision is up to each country.</p>
<p>Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said yesterday that school closures are difficult to advocate for public health reasons in most Canadian communities where both parents work outside the home.</p>
<p>"The point is clearly to reduce disease and obviously to reduce severe disease and mortality but also to reduce the social disruption and the impact that that has then on health and everything that goes with it," he said during a conference call.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said it could be better to keep kids in school and make sure they are doing things like washing their hands regularly rather than send them away to congregate at shopping malls.</p>
<p>Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King said that because those under 50 are most at risk from the virus, it's important for both students and teachers to stay home if they are ill.</p>
<p>Because viruses survive longer in winter - up to 48 hours on some surfaces - environmental cleaning is also important, she said.</p>
<p>If students from the Toronto public board miss classes, it's possible they can keep up with lessons online, said Chris Broadbent, manager of occupational health and safety for the board.</p>

<p>Federal health officials have approved the use of the antiviral drug Tamiflu in children under age one, despite limited safety data, because of the risk that swine flu poses to infants.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq signed an interim order this week, at the request of the Public Health Agency of Canada, authorizing the sale of Tamiflu to be used in the prevention of swine flu and treatment of the illness in children under one. The drug had only been approved for sale to treat patients older than one year but until further notice, it can be prescribed for patients of all ages.</p>
<p>"There were no antivirals authorized in Canada for treatment for children under the age of one," said chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones during a call with reporters on Thursday. Young children are known to be more susceptible to influenza viruses in general and Butler-Jones said that is proving true with this new strain.</p>
<p>"We know that this group is increasingly vulnerable to complications of H1N1," he said.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 Canadians have contracted swine flu since it began to spread around the world in April, and the public health agency has detailed information about 6,672 cases. Of those cases, 207 were in children under age one, and 83 were admitted to hospital, representing the highest rate of hospitalization among age groups. Ten children were in intensive care units and one baby died.</p>
<p>The notice from the public health agency says although "there are limited data supporting the use of Tamiflu in children under one" there are few treatment options when it comes to sick babies with the swine flu.</p>
<p>"Given the limited options for the treatment of this newly identified virus, the lack of this approved use could represent a critical gap," said the order.</p>
<p>The move to allow for the expanded use of Tamiflu follows the same decision by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the European Health Agency.</p>
<p>"After a careful assessment, antivirals may be prescribed with clinical discretion providing the potential benefits to the health of the infant outweigh the risks," said the new guidelines, which included dosage recommendations. Parents should be informed that Tamiflu is being prescribed for "exceptional use," it also advised.</p>
<p>The makers of the drug, Hofmann-La Rochet, are required to provide Health Canada with information, as it becomes available, about its safety and effectiveness in children under age one and any adverse reactions should be reported to Health Canada.</p>

<p>The continuing care unit for seniors at an eastern Quebec health centre has been put in quarantine after several cases of influenza were recorded. The local public health authorities for Port Cartier said yesterday that nine out of the 23 seniors in this unit have been come down with flu-like symptoms. It is not yet known whether they have been infected with the H1N1 virus. No new flu cases have been diagnosed since Sunday and if all goes well, the restrictions would be lifted Tuesday after the mandatory 10-day quarantine period.</p>

<p>"Given the limited options for the treatment of this newly identified virus, the lack of this approved use could represent a critical gap," the order said.</p>
<p>The move to allow for the expanded use of Tamiflu follows the same decision by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the European Health Agency.</p>
<p>"After a careful assessment, antivirals may be prescribed with clinical discretion providing the potential benefits to the health of the infant outweigh the risks," said the new guidelines, which included dosage recommendations. Parents should be informed that Tamiflu is being prescribed for "exceptional use," it also advised.</p>
<p>The makers of the drug, Hofmann-La Rochet, are required to provide Health Canada with information, as it becomes available, about its safety and effectiveness in children under age one and any adverse reactions should be reported to Health Canada.</p>

<p>Ontario to provide coverage of PET scans</p>
<p>Ontario will make positron emission tomography -- or PET scans -- a publicly insured health service for some cancer and cardiac patients.</p>
<p>PET scanning is a nuclear medicine diagnostic imaging exam that can provide information on both the location and the extent of the metabolic activity of abnormal tissues such as cancer.</p>
<p>PET scans can help determine the stage or extent of some cancers, and can be useful in making treatment decisions in certain advanced heart conditions.</p>
<p>Ontario Ombudsman Andre Marin pushed the province to expand PET scans after receiving numerous complaints from doctors and patients. By October, insured PET scans will be performed in Hamilton, Ottawa, London, Toronto and Thunder Bay.</p>
<p>Canadian kids can get Tamiflu</p>
<p>Young children can now be prescribed Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq signed an interim order allowing doctors to prescribe the drug to prevent infection or treat cases of swine flu in children under one year.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says while there's limited data on the use of Tamiflu in children of that age, there's an urgent need for recommendations to treat them since they have a high risk of dying from the flu.</p>
<p>Canada follows the U.S. and U.K. in allowing Tamiflu to be prescribed to very young children.</p>
<p>The drug, along with another antiviral medication called Relenza, is used to treat people with H1N1.</p>
<p>Testing of e-ciggies finds carcinogens, toxins</p>
<p>U.S. health officials say testing of electronic cigarettes, known as e-cigarettes, shows they contain cancer-causing chemicals and other toxins.</p>
<p>E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that contain cartridges filled with nicotine, flavourings and other chemicals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says the device turns nicotine, which is highly addictive, into a vapour that is inhaled.</p>
<p>The FDA says there are concerns e-cigarettes may increase nicotine addiction among young people, and lead kids to cigarettes.</p>
<p>Chimps may give AIDS clue</p>
<p>Scientists believe they have found a "missing link" in the evolution of the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
<p>It bridges the gap between the infection that does no harm to most monkeys, and the one that kills millions of people.</p>
<p>A study says that link is a virus that is killing chimpanzees in the wild at a disturbingly high rate.</p>
<p>Experts say the discovery of the disease that's killing chimps may help doctors come up with better treatments or a workable vaccine for humans.</p>

</p>
<p>Swine flu infected at least 100,000 Britons last week, officials announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Sir Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer, said there were now 840 patients in hospital in England with swine flu, 63 of them in intensive care.</p>
<p>Children are being hit hardest, with relatively few cases among the elderly, as it is thought they may have some immunity to the H1N1 virus from previous pandemics.</p>
<p>There are 169 children under the age of five in hospital, with 12 in intensive care.</p>
<p>Officials said 26 people were confirmed to have died after contracting swine flu. Children under 15 accounted for a third of deaths, while around one in seven victims was previously in good health.</p>
<p>The figures illustrating the scale of the outbreak and the size of the challenge facing the NHS were disclosed as the National Pandemic Flu Service--a new website and phone line enabling people to access antiviral drugs--opened to the public. However, the website was swamped and rendered inaccessible for hours. A spokesman for the Department of Health said the website was experiencing "unprecedented demand," receiving 9.3 million hits an hour.</p>
<p>Officials also gave warning that the disease was approaching "epidemic" levels. Justin McCracken, chief executive of the Health Protection Agency, said the number of patients going to GPs about swine flu was at epidemic level. "We are there or thereabouts," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa octogenarian dies of H1N1-related illness</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>416 words</div><div>24 July 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>An Ottawa woman in her 80s has died from complications related to the H1N1 flu virus, bringing the number of Eastern Ontario deaths associated with the illness to three.</p>
<p>The woman had an underlying medical condition and was hospitalized before she died on Wednesday, said Dr. Vera Etches, one of the city's associate medical officers of health.</p>
<p>"While this increase in the number of deaths is unfortunate, it's not unexpected when we continue to see influenza in the community," Etches said.</p>
<p>It's not known how the woman contracted the virus, or whether she was living in a nursing home at the time she fell ill, said Etches.</p>
<p>Since the start of the H1N1 pandemic in late April, the city has had only one reported outbreak of the H1N1 virus in a nursing home, which Etches said has since been contained.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cases of the novel flu strain have also been reported among the city's 20,000 health-care workers, but none likely caught the infection while working in a hospital, said Thomas Hayes, who chairs a committee of emergency planners from area hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care providers.</p>
<p>"They're members of the public just like everyone else, and so we would expect that some of them would get the flu in the course of their daily life."</p>
<p>Hayes said under provincial regulations, health-care workers with flu-like symptoms are required to report their illnesses to their supervisors and leave the workplace immediately. "It doesn't matter if they're providing direct clinical care or not. What's important is that they work in a health-care environment and so they may have interactions with patients."</p>
<p>They are then expected to stay off work for at least seven days and return only after they have been screened by their employers to ensure they no longer have symptoms, said Hayes.</p>
<p>So far, 356 cases of the H1N1 infection have been confirmed in Ottawa, with half of those being reported in children under 18. Of the confirmed cases, 62 have been admitted to hospital, with half of those being children and teens. While most have been discharged, three patients remain in hospital, Etches said.</p>
<p>Across Eastern Ontario, two other people have died, including an Ottawa teenager and a 52-year-old woman from an outlying town. Both had underlying health problems that may have contributed to their deaths.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline Inc. has begun production on a swine flu vaccine that contains a chemical additive that will allow the company to produce more vaccine with less seed stock.</p>
<p>The additive, called an adjuvant, will help make up for problems drug manufacturers have had with the virus strain producing a much lower yield of vaccine than what they would normally get for seasonal flu.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline Inc. has a contract with the federal government to produce enough vaccine to give every Canadian a shot in the event of a pandemic such as the current outbreak of H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>Two separate clinical trials began in Australia this week. The United States is ready to begin its studies by early August but the Public Health Agency of Canada has said only that it hopes to have the vaccine ready for trials by late September or early October.</p>
<p>Ottawa has also ruled the antiviral drug Tamiflu can now be prescribed to babies.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq signed an interim order this week allowing doctors to prescribe the drug to children under the age of 1. Before the order, Canada hadn't approved any antiviral medications for babies.</p>
<p>Canadian data show that babies are hospitalized, admitted to intensive-care units and die at higher rates than others infected with the H1N1 virus, said Canada's chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones.</p>

</p>
<p>Since I began writing about my experiences on the picket line for the Star two weeks ago I have noticed that my moods and, especially, some of my opinions have been changing according to what I read, hear, or see.</p>
<p>Has this happened to you?</p>
<p>Opinions change all the time. We are constantly making choices that affect our opinions. Maybe you were sprinting to work today and accidentally ordered an Irish Cream coffee instead of your regular decaf blend and realized that you were missing out on an entire universe of coffee-delight.</p>
<p>Maybe the opening of temporary dump sites or the too-late arrival of an ambulance caused your strike outlook to shift. News about the growing dangers of H1N1 could also have reversed your opinion on when this strike should be over.</p>
<p>I guess your opinion is supposed to shift and change, morphing into something new.</p>
<p>There are things in my life that I have changed my stance on, even before the strike:</p>
<p>Stuffed animals are, unfortunately, not a valuable commodity.</p>
<p>Perhaps my mother has been right on one minor, moot point.</p>
<p>I will regrettably never achieve my dream of being an early bird, and will have to catch the worm in the afternoon with the rest of society.</p>
<p>As for the strike, I'll admit it: Some issues are making me think twice about my positions.</p>
<p>Last Friday I took a field trip to Christie Pits, a closed temporary dump site. Originally, I had thought putting garbage in out-of-the-way spots in parks and treating it with pesticides was okay. But after seeing how close the piles were to the playground - and smelling the stench - I now agree with residents that using nasty chemicals to ward off rodents is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Also, the potential escalation of the H1N1 flu virus in autumn makes me worried. I didn't realize Toronto was in jeopardy. Both sides need to reconsider how long the walkout can go on.</p>
<p>And striking in the rain, something I thought I could handle, makes me feel wet, cold, uncomfortable and overall miserable.</p>
<p>However, there are some striking issues that I refuse to budge on:</p>
<p>I would still like to get back my original job, teaching toddlers to float on their stomachs.</p>
<p>The strikers got it right in using multiple, small picket lines to get their voices heard. It has raised awareness.</p>
<p>Can public opinion sway? Can attitudes morph?</p>
<p>Mine has, in some cases. And hopefully the cleanup after Caribana, the pending VIA Rail strike and the precedent to be set if Windsor's strikers settle will lead to an end to this strike, once and for all.</p>
<p>Tamie Dolny's original story for the Star, about being a teen picket, generated such response that she has been hired to write a regular column for the duration of the city workers' strike.</p>

<p>RAT ATTACKS KILL, INJURE BABIES</p>
<p>CHICAGO - A baby attacked by rats bled to death in her Louisiana crib while an Ohio infant lost two toes to the vicious rodents in a pair of bizarre attacks.</p>
<p>Three people were charged with child endangerment after authorities determined that the six-week-old Ohio baby had been bitten repeatedly by rodents "over a lengthy period of time," the Pike County sheriff department said.</p>
<p>But charges have not yet been filed in the case of the Louisiana child who bled to death last week from hundreds of rat bites, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported.</p>
<p>The girl's father was found screaming outside his home when paramedics arrived and her parents told police they did not hear the three-month-old cry out when she was attacked during her nap time.</p>
<p>Neighbours told the Picayune that the children always appeared well-cared for and that the father had recently set out traps for the rats that plagued the area.</p>
<p>A funeral was held Thursday.</p>
<p>MAN ARRANGES OWN MURDER FOR FAMILY</p>
<p>NEW YORK - A motivational speaker who fell on hard times hired a homeless man to kill him in a staged robbery so his family could collect insurance money, it was claimed.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Locker, 52, was found strangled and stabbed in his car in East Harlem last week.</p>
<p>He had earlier rung his wife at home in Long Island, N.Y., to say he was dropping off two people who had helped him change a flat tire.</p>
<p>Police arrested and charged Kenneth Minor with robbery. He was seen on CCTV footage in Locker's car and using his debit card at a cash point.</p>
<p>However, Minor, 36, who has a history of arrests for drugs and robbery offences, has claimed that Locker offered him the card as payment for killing him.</p>
<p>Minor's statement, said he "held a knife while the white male repeatedly thrust his chest into the knife, and that after doing so the white male appeared to die."</p>
<p>Prosecutors said there was no evidence that Locker wanted to die.</p>
<p>However, it has emerged that he was facing financial problems after being sued for profiting from a giant ponzi scheme. He had rejected the claim.</p>
<p>Police said the investigation into the death was ongoing.</p>

<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>ENGLISH SWINE FLU CASES EXPLODE</p>
<p>LONDON - Around 100,000 new cases of swine flu were diagnosed in England in the last week, officials said Thursday, as millions rushed to consult a new website to identify symptoms and order drugs.</p>
<p>At least 30 deaths have so far been linked to swine flu here, 26 in England and four in Scotland, according to the latest update from the Department of Health.</p>
<p>The figure is unchanged from the previous week. A further 840 people are in hospital in England, including 63 in intensive care, chief medical officer Liam Donaldson told reporters.</p>
<p>The concern felt by many over swine flu was reflected in what the government admitted was "unprecedented demand" for the new site, which launched at 3 p.m. and was soon receiving 2,600 hits per second or 9.3 million an hour.</p>
<p>Donaldson accepted that the rise in new cases -- almost double last week's figure of 55,000 -- was a "substantial increase" but stressed the majority of patients suffer only mild symptoms.</p>
<p>He told the BBC many people were probably logging on to the site out of "curiosity," adding : "It will calm down and then people with genuine flu symptoms will be able to use the system and they will get their drugs quickly and efficiently."</p>
<p>Britain is the worst-hit country in Europe by the A(H1N1) virus, which was first identified in Mexico. It gave up attempts at containment early on and is now focusing on the best way to treat infected patients.</p>
<p>TWO NEW MOZART PIECES DISCOVERED</p>
<p>VIENNA - The International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg announced Thursday that it had discovered two previously unknown compositions written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.</p>
<p>"The Department of Research at the International Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg has identified two works, which have long been in the possession of the Foundation, as compositions of the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart," the foundation said in a statement, without giving any more details.</p>
<p>The two pieces for piano are to presented to the press on Aug. 2. They will be performed by clavichordist Florian Birsak on Mozart's own fortepiano at the family's old Salzburg residence.</p>
<p>The Mozarteum foundation aims to preserve the heritage and works left by the prodigy, conducting research as well as organizing concerts.</p>
<p>This latest score is not the only one to have resurfaced in recent years however.</p>
<p>Last September, a library in Nantes, in western France, unveiled a hitherto unknown music score by Mozart that had lain in its archive undiscovered for over a century. It was authenticated by the Mozarteum.</p>
<p>In 2006, a year filled with celebrations for the 250th anniversary of Austria's favourite son, another piano score extremely likely to be the work of young Wolfgang Amadeus was discovered in Salzburg.</p>
<p>In May of last year, experts also identified three mystery musical scores discovered at Poland's historic Jasna Gora Roman Catholic monastery in southern Poland, as possible Mozart creations.</p>
<p>SPAIN UNVEILS HUGE TELESCOPE</p>
<p>MADRID - Spain is set to inaugurate a huge telescope on the Canary Islands, billed as the world's biggest scope for visible and infrared light and set to give astronomers a vital tool to map the universe.</p>
<p>Scientists behind the Great Canary Telescope say it is as powerful as four million human eyes combined and will allow researchers to peer into the darkest and most distant corners of space.</p>
<p>The observatory, perched on a mountain on the island of La Palma, will help astronomers with a wide range of research, from discovering new planets, to exploring galaxies and analyzing black holes.</p>

<p>BUJUMBURA - A court in Burundi on Thursday sentenced one person to life in prison and handed seven others jail terms over the murders of albinos, who have been targeted in connection with witchcraft.</p>
<p>"Three suspects in this case were acquitted for lack of evidence," said Dodolin Nahamasabo, the chief judge in the eastern Ruyigi province.</p>
<p>In May, prosecutors demanded heavy sentences for the 11 suspects accused of murdering albinos, whose limbs have been sold to witch doctors in neighbouring Tanzania for lucky charms.</p>
<p>At least 12 albinos were murdered and mutilated in the six months until March this year in Burundi and more than 40 have been killed since late 2007 in neighbouring Tanzania.</p>
<p>On Thursday, three people were sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted murder, while one was given seven years for complicit.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Agency won't force flu shots on workers</b>

<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has no plan to deal with front-line health care workers who refuse swine flu vaccinations, a scenario that some infectious-disease experts believe could accelerate the spread of the flu pandemic in the coming months.</p>
<p>The question of whether doctors and nurses should be forced to take flu vaccines has long been a contentious issue in the public-health community. In 2002, the Ontario government withdrew legislation that made it mandatory for paramedics to get flu shots, after the paramedics' union launched a legal challenge under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association, which represents tens of thousands of doctors nationwide, will introduce a resolution at its annual meeting next month that encourages physicians to get the swine-flu vaccine, which is expected to be ready in the fall. But the association will stop short of endorsing mandatory vaccinations, said CMA president Dr. Robert Ouellet.</p>
<p>"We think there should be informed consent," Ouellet said.</p>
<p>But some members of the medical community worry that such sensitivity toward the rights of health care workers could undermine efforts to fight the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>It is believed that roughly half of all front-line health care workers take the seasonal flu shot every year -- a higher rate of uptake than in the general public, but enough to leave an alarming gap in the pandemic battle, some experts say.</p>
<p>"Health care workers have been resistant to flu shots in general. That has been the problem," said Dr. Kumanan Wilson, a public-health policy specialist at the University of Ottawa. "The general consensus is that if you vaccinate health care workers, you improve morbidity and mortality to the patients. The No. 1 vector to transmitting it to patients would be health care workers who go from patient to patient."</p>
<p>He believes hospitals have the authority to send employees home without pay when they refuse to be vaccinated amid an outbreak. But others warn such actions could lead to more legal challenges.</p>
<p>"It's a human-rights issue," said Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions. "It's like any medication or vaccination. You cannot impose it on workers, and you cannot impose it on a community."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines advise nurses and doctors to take precautions against infection, such as wearing gloves and using respirators.</p>
<p>Frontline health care workers, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, were hit hard during the outbreak of SARS in 2003.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, health care workers accounted for more than one-third of suspected cases in severely affected countries.</p>

<p>ANOTHER Manitoba death has been linked to the H1N1 virus, raising the total number of pandemic flu-related deaths in the province to seven.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health said Wednesday that the adult who died was between the age of 18 and 65, and had a laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1 as well as other underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>The province has not released the gender of the patient, or the region where he or she lived.</p>
<p>The province also reported another 24 lab-confirmed cases of H1N1, bringing the provincial total to 855.</p>
<p>Manitoba's first H1N1-associated deaths were reported by Manitoba Health on June 16 -- a Winnipeg man and a woman from northern Manitoba, both in their 40s.</p>
<p>The woman was identified by family members as Lorraine Wilson, 45, of Opaskwayak Cree Nation.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health announced a third death associated with the virus, this time a child under the age of 18, on June 25.</p>
<p>The next day, the province announced the death of another adult who had earlier tested positive for H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>On July 6, another H1N1-related death was reported, believed to be 42-year-old Oakbank Baptist Church Rev. Perry Chernesky.</p>
<p>The province reported a sixth flu-linked death the next day.</p>
<p>Manitoba's newest death pushes the Canadian total to 51, a July 21 Public Health Agency report said. Quebec leads the way with 19 deaths, while Ontario has recorded 16. Saskatchewan has four, Alberta has three, while both B.C. and Nunavut have one.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rash of workers booking off is leaving employers cold; Public health officials say swine flu risk creates unique problem</b>

</p>
<p>As public health officials advise people to stay home from work even if they just have a cold, employers are reporting "huge increases" in absenteeism tied to concerns about the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>There are also calls for employers to revisit sick-day policies and even cut employees slack when it comes to sick notes from doctors.</p>
<p>"We have seen huge increases in absenteeism for employers across Canada this summer," said Karen Seward, a vice-president of <span class="companylink">Shepell-fgi</span>, a leading Canadian firm providing health and productivity services to employers.</p>
<p>"A lot of employers are calling us, asking, 'What's your opinion on flexibility? How do we handle all these people off?'" she said yesterday.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Shepell-fgi</span> provides services to 7,000 organizations, including both private businesses and unions, spanning 8 million employees and their families.</p>
<p>Seward said it's advisable for companies to revisit sick-day policies in light of the unique challenge that the global H1N1 pandemic has presented.</p>
<p>They should offer more flexibility on sick notes and more opportunities for employees to work from home, she said.</p>
<p>She pointed out that employers and public health officials are sending out conflicting advice on when to get sick notes for absences.</p>
<p>"I would say there are different messages from the two," she said, noting that many workplaces ask employees who have been absent for more than three days to visit the doctor and get a sick note. "Employers are saying, 'Go to your doctor, determine the severity, stay home until your flu-like symptoms have subsided.'"</p>
<p>However, health officials are advising people to see their family doctors only if their symptoms are serious or if they have underlying medical conditions - such as renal problems or compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>They say people can also raise such concerns with Telehealth Ontario, a service that offers 24-hour telephone advice from nurses. Ontario's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King said yesterday, "People who are sick should remain home, even when they have a cold."</p>
<p>She suggested those with flu symptoms are advised to stay home for seven days following the onset of symptoms, while those with colds should simply stay home until they are better, usually less than a week.</p>
<p>She said the government is continuing to monitor and update its advice.</p>
<p>Dr. Allison McGeer, head of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, said in an earlier speech that it's particularly important for health-care workers to stay home if they are sick, even with a cold. But she acknowledged it's a challenge to get that message out</p>
<p>"If someone has a cold, do they need to stay at home? The answer is yes. Absolutely, in spades," she said. "But we don't know how to do that. It's a very simple thing to say. It's a very hard thing to deliver."</p>
<p>Those so-called troopers aren't doing anyone any favours by coming to work ill, she indicated.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Atleo was seen as front runner; A hereditary chief of Ahousaht First Nation, a small Vancouver Island band, Shawn Atleo was also the youngest candidate vying to succeed outgoing AFN grand chief Phil Fontaine</b>
</div><div>Katherine O'Neill </div>

</p>
<p>Calgary --</p>
<p>The Assembly of First Nations, Canada's largest and most influential aboriginal organization, has picked British Columbia's Shawn Atleo to replace outgoing grand chief Phil Fontaine.</p>
<p>After eight ballots, Mr. Atleo, 42, edged out Perry Bellegarde, 46, a former grand chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations. The two were nearly tied after the second and third ballots Wednesday night, prompting hours of politicking before the final vote on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo will now succeed Phil Fontaine in a post often referred to by aboriginals as Canada's 14th premier.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo, a hereditary chief of Ahousaht First Nation, a small Vancouver Island band, was the contest's youngest candidate. His supporters claim he represents an important and needed generational change in leadership for the non-profit AFN. About half of first nations Canadians are 25 years old or younger.</p>
<p>He was perceived as a front-runner from the start, and believes educational and environmental issues are a top priority for native people, but also that such challenges are best met by an economically independent first nations population.</p>
<p>“We know economic independence is political independence. Economic power is political power,” he told Assembly delegates Tuesday.</p>
<p>The married father of two grown children is pledging to work with Ottawa, but he has a history of clashing with Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government over issues such as native fishing rights.</p>
<p>While the AFN represents more than 700,000 natives across Canada, only the 639 first nation chiefs or their proxies were eligible to vote in this week's election held in Calgary. Of those, 553 registered to vote in the election.</p>
<p>Because this year's AFN general assembly and grand chief election was in Calgary, Mr. Atleo's candidacy was given a boost by the fact many voters from Western Canada could attend. Also, roughly one-third, or 202, of eligible voters are from his home province of B.C.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo has a master's degree in education and is chancellor of Vancouver Island University. He has pledged to modernize and unify the AFN, which was led by Mr. Fontaine, 64, off and on since 1997.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo, who was previously the AFN's regional chief, said he hopes to work constructively with the Conservative government. “We really need to continue in the spirit of the post-apology world,” he recently told The Globe and Mail, referring to Mr. Harper's historic statement last year to former Indian residential schools students.</p>
<p>It's a conciliatory tone compared with an open letter he wrote in 2006, urging B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell to help change Mr. Harper's stance on what the Prime Minister called “racially divided fishing programs.” Mr. Atleo believed it to be an attack on aboriginal fishing rights, and wrote about the “negative consequences of [Mr. Harper's] words and tactics.”</p>
<p>In campaigning for the role of grand chief, Mr. Atleo has said economic development is key to helping solve long-standing problems that plague many reserves, including poverty, gang involvement and substance abuse.</p>
<p>Education was also an important plank of his leadership platform. Mr. Atleo's father, E. Richard Atleo, was the first aboriginal to graduate from the University of British Columbia with a PhD. “What I've seen in my father and the rest of his generation is incredible resilience to bear the burden of going through the ? most difficult, dark chapter in our history–where he couldn't go to a hotel room or get a seat in a restaurant,” Mr. Atleo recently told the Georgia Strait newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo and Mr. Bellegarde were tied after a second ballot. That ballot was also supposed to list Ontario's Grand Council Chief John Beaucage. However, in a surprise move, he dropped out shortly after the first set of results were announced and threw his support to Mr. Bellegarde.</p>
<p>Candidates Bill Wilson and Manitoba Chief Terrance Nelson both failed to garner enough votes to advance to the second ballot.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo, whose campaign slogan was “Gathering Voices: It's Our Time,” is the assembly's first grand chief from B.C. since George Manuel held the office 30 years ago. He was a high-profile native leader in the province, acting as a spokesman in notable cases such as the death of Sherry Charlie, a 19-month-old killed in 2002, and the battle over the rogue orca whale Luna, who a native band believed held the spirit of a late chief.</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo also has a green streak, sitting on Mr. Campbell's 16-member Climate Action Team for greenhouse gas reduction, and having attended a lecture on Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth delivered by the former vice-president himself.</p>
<p>He also toured both India and Indonesia, speaking with indigenous populations on behalf of the AFN.</p>
<p>B.C.'s minister for aboriginal relations and reconciliation, George Abbot, welcomed Mr. Atleo's victory. “I've had the opportunity to work in the past with Shawn Atleo, I'm very impressed with his abilities, his vision and his commitment, and very much welcome the opportunity to work with him,” he told The Globe and Mail.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell, who has worked closely with Mr. Atleo building a “new relationship” with first nations in his province, welcomed the result. “I think he has been an exceptional first nations leader in British Columbia. His goal of trying to build an era of reconciliation amongst first nations, of building strength in first nations communities across the country, bodes well for the future not just for first nations but for Canada as well.”</p>
<p>Kiera Ladner, the Canada research chair in indigenous politics & governance at the University of Manitoba, said his election represents a generational shift for the AFN. “As the next Grand Chief, Atleo represents hope and an opportunity for change for communities and for the AFN itself,” she said, noting that tackling the H1N1 virus's disproportionate presence in native communities will be one of his major challenges.</p>
<p>“It will take great vision to unite Aboriginal people and great strength as a leader to face off with the Canadian government. Coming from a nation of fisherman, Atleo will chart his own course – perhaps marking a departure from the co-operation and compromise that has come to characterize the AFN.”</p>
<p>Mr. Atleo will have to roll up his sleeves quickly. There are tough files emerging in Ottawa for the cash-strapped assembly, which posted a $1.6-million deficit last fiscal year.</p>
<p>Federal Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl has been advocating for big policy changes in recent months, including plans to skew economic development money toward bands that can make a strong business case for the funds. He has also called for an overhaul of the Indian Act's definition of status and for changes in band council elections.</p>
<p>In his final address to the Assembly of First Nations earlier this week, Mr. Fontaine said it's disappointing that a movement to “brand” aboriginal leaders as unaccountable is emerging.</p>
<p>“We've had to contend with that and it's been a huge struggle because every time we go before the government for fair treatment, we're told, ‘well, if you can convince us that you're prepared to be more accountable, we'll consider giving you more money,'” he said, warning his successor to get ready for a possible federal election, as early as this fall.</p>
<p>“We have to be ready, once again, to state our case,” he said.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Poor nations to get 20% of Canadian flu vaccine; GlaxoSmithKline commits one-fifth of production of swine flu drug but promises to supply enough for use here</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO AND GLORIA GALLOWAY </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO and OTTAWA -- About 20 per cent of a swine flu vaccine produced in Canada will be shipped to developing nations, the country's pandemic vaccine contractor said yesterday, while assuring Canadians it will meet its contractual obligations to produce enough doses for all who want it.</p>
<p>But it remains unclear how quickly a pandemic H1N1 vaccine could be mass produced as the world braces for what could be a more severe version of the virus this fall. Pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said it was in discussions with the government on a clinical trial program; Australia began its human trials this week and the United States announced yesterday that several thousand volunteers will roll up their sleeves by the second week of August.</p>
<p>The Canadian government has insisted that when a vaccine is ready, likely in early November, there will be enough for every Canadian who wants it. Neither Health Canada nor the Public Health Agency of Canada was willing to comment yesterday on GSK's commitment to allocate one-fifth of the production from its Ste-Foy, Que., facility to developing countries.</p>
<p>The decision to donate was made by the company, not the federal government.</p>
<p>“To further ensure that the vaccine is available to developing nations, and subject to the yield and existing contractual commitments, GSK has allocated 20 per cent of production at its Canadian manufacturing site to developing countries from early September onwards,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The priority of the Quebec facility is to produce vaccine for Canada. But, if an effective vaccine is developed, it can churn out more than the amount it can put into vials and syringes to be distributed nationally. The rest can be shipped in bulk to companies that need it.</p>
<p>Ottawa has not made any commitments to deliver vaccine to poorer countries. There was discussion about a potential donation when Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and other Canadian health officials met with their international counterparts in Mexico this month. But Canada has not decided what it will do to help, a government spokesman said yesterday.</p>
<p>That decision has become more difficult since it was discovered that the vaccine would take longer to develop. The new virus strain is not growing fast enough in the eggs used as a mainstay of flu vaccine production. Manufacturers report strains are producing barely half as much yield to make vaccines as the seasonal flu virus.</p>
<p>GSK said yesterday an adjuvanted vaccine is in production. Adjuvants are chemical additives that improve the immune response so less vaccine is needed. That means the firm could produce vaccines using less seed stock, which is important given the low yield to date. GSK plans to use an adjuvant system called AS03.</p>
<p>But there are no adjuvanted vaccines in Canada, so it would require a new licence and more clinical trials, making mass production more complicated.</p>
<p>GSK said yesterday that human trials will be limited because of the need to provide the vaccine quickly. “Additional studies will therefore be required and conducted after the vaccine is made available,” the company said.</p>
<p>Amir Attaran, a professor in law and medicine at the University of Ottawa, said Canadians shouldn't be concerned that the vaccine may not go through a full spectrum of clinical tests, because there would be risks regardless. The tests help health officials better gauge the magnitude of those risks.</p>
<p>“Given the likely risk of influenza this year, not knowing the magnitude of the risk of the vaccine is an uncomfortable reality. But it's also not a game changer,” Prof. Attaran said.</p>
<p>What is more concerning, he said, is the potential shortage of a vaccine. He said the production capacity GSK has reserved for developing countries will be meaningless if that's the case. “The big problem here is the scarcity of production capacity,” he said.</p>
<p>A Health Canada spokesman said yesterday that the agency is working with others around the world to “ensure that appropriate control measures would be in place to monitor the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine and to ensure the timely communication of any potential adverse events following immunization.”</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has asked companies to donate at least 10 per cent of their production or to allow poorer countries to purchase the vaccines at reduced prices.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Toronto ready to treat flu patients in city gyms</p>
<p>Health officials in Toronto are taking the first steps toward establishing flu-assessment clinics in gymnasiums and community centres that will be put into action if the pandemic virus turns much more nasty this fall.</p>
<p>It's just one of the many preparations being made by towns and cities across the country in advance of a potentially serious onslaught of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Some of the 427 doctors who told Toronto Public Health they would volunteer for flu duty have received letters from David McKeown, the city's medical officer of health, asking whether they would work in one of the centres.</p>
<p>People who develop symptoms of the flu would be diverted away from hospital emergency rooms and doctors' offices to a gym full of other patients in a similar condition. That would curtail the spread of the disease and allow hospitals to focus on treating patients who are critically ill as a result of the virus.</p>
<p>Anne Marie Aikins, a spokeswoman for Toronto Public Health, said yesterday the centres have been part of the city's pandemic plan since 2006. They are also part of the Ontario plan.</p>
<p>“This is so our health-care system doesn't get overburdened,” Ms. Aikins said. The flu centres would be used only in the event that the municipal health-care system is overwhelmed with cases, she said.</p>
<p>Other Canadian cities are contemplating similar actions.</p>
<p>Cory Neudorf, the chief medical officer for the Saskatoon's health region, said all of Saskatchewan's health regions, as part of their pandemic plans, are assessing the need to set up flu clinics.</p>
<p>The decision will be based on the number of people requiring primary care, Dr. Neudorf said. Some regions may also designate one of their hospitals as the location for people with flu symptoms, he said.</p>
<p>The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has established a pandemic working group to share information about the most recent developments related to H1N1, and pandemic preparedness and response.</p>
<p>Some municipalities have fast-tracked the purchase of personal protective equipment or implemented communications strategies to share critical information with employees and citizens, the federation said in an e-mail.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Comedy of errors on health-care stage; Mistakes at federal and Alberta levels led to failure to protect citizens</b>
</div><div>Graham Thomson </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>939 words</div><div>23 July 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal </div>
</p>
<p>If you're in the mood for an enjoyable piece of escapism this summer, might I suggest Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors being performed at Edmonton's Hawrelak Park until July 26.</p>
<p>However, if you're in the mood for a dark comedy of errors, might I suggest you pick up a copy of the Report of the Independent Investigator into the 2008 Listereosis Outbreak. This 181-page report from Sheila Weatherill-- former CEO of Edmonton's Capital Health Authority--expertly dissects the deadly bacterial outbreak last summer from <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span>. Call it a tragedy of errors.</p>
<p>It is a long but not difficult read except for the parts where government incompetence and negligence will have you fighting the urge to get on a plane, fly to Ottawa, and berate the first health-protection official you come across. If you do fall prey to the urge, head to the offices of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p>
<p>Canada's food inspection system failed and as a result Canadians were placed in mortal danger from doing nothing more dangerous than eating a bologna sandwich. By the time the outbreak subsided, 57 people had become severely ill and 22 died. "These numbers do not adequately describe the human impact of this outbreak, which affected mostly frail, elderly individuals living in long-term care homes," says Weatherill's report. "Some of the(bacteria) contaminated products that caused the outbreak were specifically packaged for the very institutions where these vulnerable people were most likely to be found."</p>
<p>Weak leadership</p>
<p>Weatherill blames a "vacuum in senior leadership" as well as "confusion and weak decision-making."</p>
<p>Maple Leaf has apologized for the outbreak and is settling $27 million in class-action suits. The federal government has flatly refused any compensation but has agreed to accept Weatherill's recommendations to toughen rules governing the Canadian Food Inspection Agency(CFIA). What makes this tragedy all the more infuriating is that the rules we had in place would have protected Canadians if they had been followed and if senior officials had paid closer attention. "At the outset, the outbreak was not considered a severe food-borne emergency," says Weatherill. "It took close to three weeks before senior executives in all key organizations became fully engaged in the event. ...We were told that while front-line and scientific staff on both the public health and food safety sides of the investigation were hard at work responding to the crisis, their superiors were not initially fully engaged."</p>
<p>Castingperilsbeforeswineflu</p>
<p>As if Weatherill's conclusions aren't enough to shake your faith in our food-inspection system, her report was released the same day the CFIA acknowledged two of its inspectors had removed their protective gear while inside an Alberta barn filled with pigs infected with H1N1 influenza last April.</p>
<p>Within days, both inspectors were diagnosed with swine flu but not before one of them, according to CBC News, flew to the federal virology lab in Winnipeg to deliver some blood samples from the sick animals.</p>
<p>The food inspection agency says there's no indication anyone was infected from CFIA's Typhoid Mary on the flight. But how can we trust their word after their bungled handling of the listeriosis outbreak?</p>
<p>And what are we to make of health-care professionals here in Alberta at the High Prairie Health Complex who recycled single-use syringes between patients up until late last year?On Tuesday, the Health Quality Council of Alberta released a report into the potentially dangerous practice and blamed a "culture of conformity" where some doctors and nurses worked together in a self-perpetuating bubble of misinformation.</p>
<p>The council's chief, Dr. John Cowell, said no one in authority had specifically told the doctors or nurses to change their practices because no one realized how "isolated" the operating room teams had become from guidelines used by other health-care workers.</p>
<p>Cowell points out this was never a case of nurses reusing dirty needles on a patient's body but rather improperly reusing the "syringe" or plastic cylinder to inject medicine into a patient's intravenous tubing. The nurses, says Cowell, thought they were doing nothing wrong: "The nursing staff believed that the tubing that was used had a one-way valve on it which would have prevented a backflow, but in fact it wasn't a one-way valve."</p>
<p>It's probably of little comfort to the 2,700 former patients who have been tested for HIV and hepatitis since the story broke last fall that the nurses were simply doing their best with misinformation or outdated practices. So far, there's no evidence anyone was infected due to reused syringes.</p>
<p>And it is disturbing for all of us to see how those employed to protect us from health threats ranging from tainted meat to communicable disease let us down.</p>
<p>Rules have been changed, reports have been written, wrists have been slapped. But no heads have rolled. In each case you are left with a nagging question, who is accountable?</p>
<p>If you're in a bloody-minded mood after hearing these tales, might I suggest you indulge your anger in another of Shakespeare's plays being performed at Hawrelak Park: Titus Andronicus.</p>
<p>It is a story of politics, betrayal and death. But for real-life tragedy, it can't beat the Report of the Independent Investigator into the 2008 Listereosis Outbreak.</p>

<p>Regardless of the outcome of Wednesday's dramatic election for a new chief of the Assembly of First Nations, it was clear after the first ballot that Canada's aboriginal people were on the cusp of a new era, looking for a future built by, and for, its youth.</p>
<p>The two leading candidates, B. C.'s Shawn Atleo and Saskatchewan's Perry Bellegarde, were the youngest of the five who stood for the assembly's top post.</p>
<p>For official observer John Kim Bell, it was a watershed moment.</p>
<p>"We are witnessing a change of the generational guard," said Bell, the noted composer who became the first aboriginal to conduct a symphony orchestra, the Toronto Symphony, in 1980.</p>
<p>"I think the community desperately needs change because we have a population explosion," Bell said. "There are many, many young people and this current generation is just unwilling to face the kind of poverty, unemployment and dysfunction that exists in the community."</p>
<p>Another aboriginal artist, comedian Don Burnstick, agreed.</p>
<p>"It's an exciting time to be an Indian. Both of them are young, idealistic. They are very motivated," said Burnstick, a Bellegarde supporter.</p>
<p>On hand to entertain delegates, he said he was amazed by the youth contingent at the assembly.</p>
<p>"I've met 15 chiefs here who are in their 20s and 30s. They are all very educated. They grasp, and they value, the notions of environment, of a diverse society and of business opportunities."</p>
<p>Atleo, 42, with a masters in education and compared by his supporters to Barack Obama, seemed poised to take over from outgoing, four-term leader Phil Fontaine after the first ballot, where he took 43 per cent of vote. Sixty per cent is required to win.</p>
<p>Bellegarde, 46, held 29 per cent of the votes, but made a strong comeback on the second ballot to pull within four votes of Atleo, setting the stage for one of the most exciting finishes in assembly history.</p>
<p>The two were one vote apart after three ballots late last night.</p>
<p>Bell said the winning candidate will face a formidable challenge without dramatic change from within. "I don't think it matters too much between them. They are both good guys. I think the issue is making the Assembly of First Nations a more relevant organization."</p>
<p>Plagued with a deficit, Bell said First Nations chiefs need to fund the organization and empower it without federal support.</p>
<p>"It's an advocacy group now. It's not really a government. If the (federal) government is not going to support it, the chiefs should fund it so it can be truly representative of First Nations people, so that it can speak out. The way it is now, if you speak out, the government cuts your funding. I think there needs to be structural change, without question, if we are to progress."</p>
<p>For Burnstick, the close vote will require a healing of factions, something Atleo stressed with a unity message.</p>
<p>Burnstick worried, though, that the generation both men represent is at extreme risk due to the H1N1 virus and age-old problems of drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>"It has always been one wave after another for our people, with the first smallpox epidemic, then tuberculosis. Now we have the pandemic. It's hit our people hard, especially our young people. We have people crammed together in houses, the spread of illness, water problems. We don't have a very good history with disease."</p>
<p>Bell said both Atleo and Bellegarde bode well for First Nations people.</p>
<p>"The younger guys are more pro-development and pro-self determination, and I think this is a very good thing."</p>
<p>Bellegarde and Atleo have appeal for First Nations youth, with their shared emphasis on economic development and education. This, too, said Burnstick, is good.</p>
<p>"It's like the old story. When the buffalo were attacked, they put the young ones in the middle, to protect them."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa will weigh request for H1N1 priority</b>
</div><div>Michelle Lang </div>

</p>
<p>Government will consider risk factors facing native communities, including higher rates of underlying disease and crowded living conditions, when deciding who should be a priority for the H1N1 vaccine, a federal official said in Calgary on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some aboriginal leaders, who are meeting here for the Assembly of First Nations election, argued earlier this week First Nations should be a top priority for an swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has said the H1N1 vaccine-- for a virus that has been declared a global pandemic--should be ready by late October or early November.</p>
<p>But the shots will not be available all at once and Ottawa is considering which high-risk groups should be at the top of the list for immunization when it is ready.</p>
<p>"The questions are there around who should be a priority," said Dr. Karen Grimsrud, senior medical adviser for the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>"In remote and isolated(First Nations) communities, are there special conditions existing there that should be considered when looking at priority groups?We have said yes there are."</p>
<p>Grimsrud and other health officials met with native leaders gathered in Calgary on Wednesday about the H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>On Monday, several aboriginal leaders said it appears native people are more at risk than the general population of developing serious cases of H1N1 and called on Ottawa to make aboriginals a priority for vaccination.</p>
<p>Grimsrud agreed that higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart and lung disease, are present in aboriginal communities. Chronic diseases are considered risk factors for developing more serious cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>She said crowding in homes is also an issue in remote communities and said all of these factors will be considered as the government draws up a list of priority recipients for the vaccine, which should be complete by late August.</p>
<p>Ottawa came under fire at Wednesday's meeting for its handling of H1N1 outbreaks on some Manitoba reserves.</p>
<p>Officials with the Manitoba-based Southern Chief's Organization said communities that asked for masks and gloves to combat the disease didn't always receive the supplies.</p>
<p>"Health Canada is not being forthright in explaining what resources are available," said Shirli Ewanchuk, director of health with the Southern Chief's Organization.</p>
<p>Health Canada officials said they are working with native communities and the provinces to address any issues during the recent outbreaks and prepare for the fall flu season.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of lessons being learned about some successes, and communities that had challenges accessing information," said Valerie Gideon of the federal department.</p>

</p>
<p>The first Canadian case of swine flu that is resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu raises a red flag but flu experts yesterday were still far from pushing the panic button.</p>
<p>The resistant virus was found in a Quebec man, 60, who was given a preventive dose of the antiviral as a precaution because he had a pulmonary condition. His son fell sick with the virus.</p>
<p>But the father also became ill and researchers at a Quebec City laboratory on emerging viruses and antiviral resistance discovered he had a new strain of drug-resistant H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>It's believed the virus adapted to the drug and became resistant. There is no evidence the man transmitted the resistant virus to anyone else and he recovered quickly without going to hospital.</p>
<p>"It's one isolated case. We have to see what happens, and if we do see more and more resistance coming up, then that would be concerning," said Dr. Susy Hota, an infectious disease expert with the University Health Network in Toronto.</p>
<p>She said the use of Tamiflu to prevent infections - a measure called prophylaxis - can give rise to resistant strains of the virus.</p>
<p>So far, four other cases have been reported worldwide since the end of last month, in Japan, Denmark and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hota said it is reassuring that in all cases but one, patients had been taking Tamiflu to prevent infection when they developed the new strain.</p>
<p>"From what we've seen so far, this strain isn't very good at spreading from person to person," she added.</p>
<p>The new drug-resistant virus is raising concerns about the reliability of Tamiflu, the main weapon in the pandemic drug arsenal of most countries, including Canada. There are only two antiviral drugs currently available, and Tamiflu makes up 80 per cent of the 50 million doses reserved for Canadians.</p>
<p>The other 20 per cent of the stockpile is the antiviral drug Relenza, which is harder to administer because it has to be inhaled into the lungs and cannot, for instance, be given to children.</p>

<p>Governments and scientists around the world ramped up the hunt yesterday for a vaccine to battle the swine-flu pandemic, with Australia launching human trials for a serum.</p>
<p>U.S. officials announced they were searching for volunteers to run their own trials of two swine-flu vaccines, and a Chinese drug company said it would soon test its own preparation to fight the H1N1 virus, which has killed more than 700 people worldwide.</p>
<p>Drug giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> also said yesterday it was making "rapid progress" on producing another vaccine to be ready by September.</p>

<p>PARIS</p>
<p>French health officials say at least 64 new H1N1 flu cases have been detected around Paris in one day.</p>
<p>The inspection for sanitary affairs says 47 cases were found at a language school housing foreign students including many from Spain and Britain. The school is located in Issy-les-Moulineux, next to Paris.</p>
<p>Another 17 cases were found at a high school in Passy-Buzenval, also near Paris, among Italian students studying French.</p>
<p>Health inspector Dr. Juan Vinas says nearly all patients detected on Wednesday were faring well and have been quarantined to a closed-off floor in their boarding homes.</p>
<p>One has been hospitalized because of complications linked to asthma.</p>

<p>Do hot dogs need cancer warning labels?</p>
<p>An anti-meat advocacy group says hot dogs are so hazardous to one's health that they should have warning labels.</p>
<p>The group, called the Cancer Project, wants to force hot dog makers to use warning labels. An offshoot of a pro-vegetarian organization, the Cancer Project filed a lawsuit yesterday on behalf of three New Jersey residents against several frankfurter makers.</p>
<p>The lawsuit cites a report by the American Institute for Cancer Research that concluded regular consumption of processed meat can increase the risk of colorectal and other forms of cancer.</p>
<p>Drug-resistant swine flu found in Quebec</p>
<p>The first Canadian case of Tamiflu-resistant swine flu virus has turned up.</p>
<p>It's a Quebec man who was given the drug to prevent infection.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old patient was given the flu antiviral after his son fell ill with the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>It's believed the resistance arose in the man and there is no evidence he transmitted resistant virus to anyone else.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says it looks to be an isolated case.</p>
<p>U.S. seeks volunteers for first swine flu shots</p>
<p>Uncle Sam wants a few thousand American volunteers to roll up their sleeves for the first swine flu shots.</p>
<p>It's a race to see if a new vaccine will really protect against the virus before it's expected rebound later this year. The government studies will start in healthy adults at eight medical centres around the U.S.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Lewis Black still ranting after all these years - even at a table set for epicures</b>
</div><div>BILL BROWNSTEIN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>1098 words</div><div>23 July 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Here's something you probably didn't know about Lewis Black, the most acerbic social and political commentator on the continent: He loves golf. But the relationship isn't reciprocal.</p>
<p>"Golf hates me," grunts Black, in town to spew and to serve as ringmaster for tonight's Just for Laughs gala at Théâtre St. Denis. (Black also hosted last night's gala, as a last-minute replacement for John Cleese.)</p>
<p>"I just ravage my soul while I play the game. I got into it as a kid. It was a great way to get away from everybody."</p>
<p>Here's something else you probably didn't know about Black: The Grammy award winner and editorialist on Jon Stewart's Daily Show is something of an epicure. His search for the finest eats in town has led him to Joe Beef in that ever-burgeoning food belt on Notre Dame St. W.</p>
<p>Black, along with his managers and fellow foodie, friend and comic Bobby Slayton, is feasting on oysters, stuffed clams, zucchini flowers stuffed with crab, foie gras, pheasant, Peking duck-style chicken, ribs and the ever-tantalizing lobster spaghetti - "insanely delicious," Black pronounces of the latter - all washed down with two magnums of Bordeaux (red, of course) and all orchestrated by Joe Beef chef/co-owner David McMillan, who, no surprise, is a fan of Black's scathing satire.</p>
<p>Truly, Black's bite is on equal footing with his bark.</p>
<p>And here's something you might have expected from Black, particularly when joined by Slayton (who appears at tonight's Black gala before presiding over a midnight Nasty Show at Club Soda): They have come up with an idea for a culinary reality show - Death by Food, which would be modelled on that classic French dining-film orgy La Grande bouffe and would feature the wits gorging themselves into submission, all the while doing shtick. Gordon Ramsay, eat your heart and soul out.</p>
<p>None of this is to suggest that Black has gone soft.</p>
<p>True, the last few years have been relatively golden - certainly compared to his earlier lean years, decades - with numerous HBO and Comedy Central specials, concert tours, DVD and CD releases and books. But while many comics have become less strident since the arrival of Barack Obama, Black continues to rage - hilariously - with wild abandon.</p>
<p>"The dark side is still there," says Black, 60, who, perhaps not so coincidentally, was born in Washington, D.C. "We've still got our Congress. In fact, if you blew George W. Bush into 535 pieces, he'd be Congress."</p>
<p>Black is building up steam now. "It looks like we're not going to get alternate energy. It's an absolute must. There is no discussion. They've finally raised the miles per gallon on cars after 26 years, and the argument now is that the roads won't be safe. The argument before was that if this was enacted, giant Kodiak bears would rule the Earth."</p>
<p>And don't get him started on universal health care in the U.S. Too late. "Elected Democrats and Republicans, a group of people with the best health insurance plans in the country, are arguing whether or not to give out health insurance to others. Really! Well,</p>
<p>'f--- them' is all I have to say. They're not allowed to argue that, unless they figure out how to give it to everybody." Pause. "The two-party system in the U.S. is just like a bowl of s--- looking in the mirror."</p>
<p>But he must be buoyed by the election of fellow pundit Al Franken to the U.S. Senate. "Yeah, it's good, because now I move up the ladder a little and my income goes up," he cracks.</p>
<p>Unlike most comics who visit this land, he follows the Canadian political scene closely. And while he finds himself in favour of many of our institutions and laws, he doesn't pull his punches in taking shots at our politicos. "Didn't Stephen Harper actually call it the Mexican flu (as opposed to the swine flu)? But my favourite Canadian politician is your minister of science (Gary Goodyear). I hear he's a creationist. That was the first chink in his armour."</p>
<p>According to the lore, Black was a colicky baby, which pretty much explains everything. He can't recall ever not being cranky. But his first love was the theatre. He studied it at the University of North Carolina and later obtained a degree from the Yale drama school - where he never ran into fellow Yalie Dubya. After moving to New York, Black became playwright-in-residence at an avant-garde theatre company, but turned to stand-up to pay the rent.</p>
<p>His big break came when he was conscripted to create a weekly rant, Back in Black, on the Daily Show in 1996. Then came his comedy specials and Root of All Evil show on Comedy Central. He won best male stand-up at the American Comedy Awards in 2001.</p>
<p>Less known about Black is that he is involved in several charitable endeavours benefiting sufferers of autism and cystic fibrosis. And despite his opposition to the war in Iraq, he has become involved with the USO and has toured military bases in the Middle East and Europe.</p>
<p>Black recently hooked up with the Canadian Trailer Park Boys to concoct a TV series, "a Dr. Strangelove take on Iraq," but their pitch was shot down by the pay-cable giants in the U.S. "When I went in to do the pitch, I said: 'The good news is this is totally unique. The bad news is this is totally unique.' Problem was that it was way smart."</p>
<p>Black is currently rewriting a 25-year-old play of his. "It's a romantic comedy," he says softly.</p>
<p>A romantic comedy! What? Will this mellow him out?</p>
<p>"Oh, f--- no. Theatre is like going back to prison for me. Everyone working for nothing. I'll go nuts in no time."</p>
<p>Dessert, anyone?</p>
<p>Lewis Black is host of tonight's Just for Laughs gala at 7 at Théâtre St. Denis, 1594 St. Denis St. A few tickets remain. Info and reservations: 514-845-2322 or hahaha.com.</p>

</p>
<p>I was on top of Acadia Mountain in Maine enjoying my summer vacation when I received a call from a friend who said: You have a 48-hour deadline to return to Canada, if you don't you will need to wait to get a visa.</p>
<p>I am a Mexican citizen - a Mexican passport holder who lives and works in New York. I share an apartment in Montreal with my Canadian-resident common-law partner. I enter Canada probably once a week, and stay here for vacations and holidays because   he is getting a PhD in Montreal and needs to spend time in the city.</p>
<p>I walked down the mountain, drove to civilization, found an Internet connection and read the news. Yes, it was true, Mexicans and Czechs had a 48-hour grace period to obtain a visa at the border. After that, they would need to get a visa through a consular office.</p>
<p>We were vacationing in Maine and planned to go to Montreal to drop camping gear, get his stuff and head to New York, Chicago and Mexico. Instead, we cut short our Maine visit and headed north to New Brunswick.</p>
<p>I didn't lose much, maybe missed the sun in Maine to get to the rainy Maritimes. But I can't stop thinking of full families with summer vacation plans to Canada who already had paid hotels and accommodations and are now having to wait for a visa without any certainty.</p>
<p>And I also think of people who fly through Canada because they don't have an American visa and now have to pay the extra expense and have the extra stress of not  knowing whether they will be granted the Canadian visa or not).</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico are neighbours and members of a free-trade agreement. We don't stab each other in the back. </p>
<p>I do know people from Mexico who applied for Canadian refugee status and got it, and other people who were refused. I don't think any of those people were genuine refugees. But there are similar bogus applications from all nationalities, not just Mexicans.</p>
<p>I understand there is a problem, and Mexicans with fake claims are at fault, but a two-day notice?</p>
<p>Would it be better to announce this decision three or six months in advance so people don't buy worthless tickets?. Why didn't Canada wait until September when people get back to work and school and there are fewer people stranded in airports and consulates?</p>
<p>Mexicans have had a hard year. The Mexican economy has shrunk nine per cent. Then came the swine-flu outbreak, and a war on drugs that has the country in the world news.</p>
<p>I came to study in Canada for my PhD and when I moved from the U.S., I waited a long time for my student visa (the paperwork was supposed to take a few weeks and ended up being months). I am fortunate to have resources and friends and family to bail me out of trouble when I get caught in a bad situation. But what about those who don't have either the money or people to support them?</p>
<p>This is wrong. You don't treat people like this, you don't treat your neighbours like this. This is a little bit like many things in Canada - a passive-aggressive attack, subtle but with lots of damage. I think Canadian policy- makers need to rethink their strategies.</p>
<p>This measure is just wrong.</p>

</p>
<p>As far as West Island day camps are concerned, this is the summer that hand-washing graduated from simple hygiene to a full-fledged activity, right up there with swimming and soccer.</p>
<p>Any parents wondering why hand-washing is cutting into their kids' arts and crafts time, it's all because of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Many local day camps prepared their staff in advance on preventing the spread of the swine flu and most will ask kids with a fever to stay home until they are symptom-free.</p>
<p>"We actually had special training for our staff on swine flu," said Brent Cullen, section manager of youth programs for Pointe Claire summer camps.</p>
<p>The city has six camps with about 285 campers.</p>
<p>"We're stressing the importance of hand-washing."</p>
<p>Luckily, there seems to have been no huge flu outbreaks that sent tons of campers packing.</p>
<p>Leanne Stachecki, junior camp supervisor for Pointe Claire, said her camp at Lakeside Heights has been unscathed by the virus.</p>
<p>At Vanier Super Camp in St. Laurent, director Warren Roy said the rule is "hand-washing ad infinitum" at his day camp.</p>
<p>"It's almost considered an activity," he said. "We are really promoting hand-washing."</p>
<p>He said kids with a fever will be sent home, but that's always been the rule.</p>
<p>At the Westminister Day Camp in Dollard des Ormeaux, letters went out to parents saying they would be asked to pick up sick kids.</p>
<p>"We adopted the same protocol as the Lester B. Pearson School Board," said Tina Spinder, president of the board of directors.</p>
<p>She said there were no cases after the first week and everyone is keeping their fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Mike Homsy, director of the Excel Sports Camp at John Abbott College in Ste. Anne de Bellevue, said the camp hasn't made any special preparations for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"There are hand sanitizers throughout the college and kids are being encouraged to use them," he said.</p>

<p>If the predicted "second wave" of the H1N1 flu pandemic hits Ottawa in the fall, the Ottawa Police Service is preparing to shut down whole fields of operation to keep officers working on the department's top priorities.</p>
<p>Ontario's plan for an influenza pandemic predicts that, if the H1N1 pandemic hits Ottawa, one out of every three people could get sick, with the potential for 80 deaths per week.</p>
<p>"If we are faced with a situation where 30 per cent of our people are away from work, we know what areas of the police service -- non-priority areas -- where we can shut down or reduce service in order to reallocate staff to core service areas," said Supt. Charles Bordeleau, the police's manager of emergency operations.</p>
<p>Bordeleau described the police's core service areas as the work of frontline patrol officers who respond to emergencies and crimes in progress.</p>
<p>Other priorities include the 911 call centre, investigations into major crimes and maintaining community safety.</p>
<p>He said the police's emergency response time -- within 10 minutes of receiving a call -- would not change even if a serious pandemic grips Ottawa and nearly one-third of the police force was off sick.</p>
<p>However, if a pandemic was to reduce staffing levels significantly, Bordeleau said police would be unable to provide support services such as community policing centres and school resource officers.</p>
<p>Investigations into less-serious crimes would also be affected. For example, Bordeleau said that, if your home were broken into, but the intruder was not still in the house, it may take longer for police officers to arrive to begin their investigation.</p>
<p>Paid-duty police officers would also not be available for special events.</p>
<p>"These are critical areas for the police service to deliver, but, when we're faced with an emergency where we have to make hard decisions about reallocating our staff, they've been deemed as lower priorities," Bordeleau said.</p>
<p>Although he provided some examples of what the police consider to be priority and non-priority services, Bordeleau said he could not provide a complete list of services that would be temporarily shut down or reduced in a pandemic scenario because doing so would compromise public safety.</p>
<p>"What the public needs to know is that our core emergency services are our priority areas, and when we talk about operational decisions we make around what services would be either slowing down or shutting down, I don't think it's a matter of public knowledge," Bordeleau said. "There are certain services that we would decrease or stop doing that wouldn't be in the best interest of the public or the criminal element to be aware of, for operational security reasons."</p>
<p>Bordeleau said all police officers were trained to do regular patrol and respond to emergencies, so it wouldn't be difficult to move staff around as needed.</p>
<p>He said police did not expect an increase in the crime rate during a flu outbreak, but they were prepared to bolster their frontline presence in case of panic or large crowds at hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>He said police would increase their street-level presence as they did in previous emergencies, such as the 1998 ice storm and the 2003 blackout, to "maintain a sense of security for our community."</p>
<p>"Visibility is very important," he said. "If we have areas where we see there may be some problems escalating, then we would increase our presence."</p>
<p>The Ottawa police began developing their pandemic preparations about five years ago.</p>
<p>At the time, Insp. Alain Bernard was leading the program, and he first set out to see what other police agencies across the country were doing with regards to pandemic planning.</p>
<p>"We quickly found out that not many police agencies out there had developed the modeling of 10, 20, 30 per cent staffing and what core services they would maintain and how they would reallocate staff," Bordeleau said.</p>
<p>Ottawa police are now considered the leaders in this regard.</p>
<p>Bordeleau, a 25-year-veteran of the police service, says a serious flu outbreak differs from other emergencies police need to prepare for because of how it would likely affect their own officers.</p>
<p>"What pandemic planning brought alive to our organization is the issue of not only could the community be impacted by sick leave or sickness, but (also) our own internal staff as well," he said.</p>
<p>"It really forced us to take a hard look at how do we make decisions around what services we need to continue delivering and what services we either reduce or stop delivering in the interim."</p>

</p>
<p>Every time I see an assurance from health authorities that the H1N1 vaccine will be available in a few months, I get a little knot of dread in the pit of my stomach. I've got a big, scary decision to make soon.</p>
<p>I'm pregnant; the baby's due in January. That puts me in one of the high-risk categories for H1N1, and it also puts me on the priority list for the vaccine when it comes.</p>
<p>There are excellent reasons to roll up my sleeve and get the shot. H1N1 is a known, serious risk to pregnant women; many have already fallen ill and died. My immune system was strong before I got pregnant and I have no respiratory problems, but I know (believe me, I know) that pregnancy changes everything. I can't trust this body to act predictably anymore, not for the next six months anyway.</p>
<p>The trouble is, I also have trouble trusting what medical authorities tell me.</p>
<p>It's not that I have some irrational fear of medical science in general. Medical science is great. I just got back from a visit to my new family doctor, and I couldn't be happier to have one after searching for five years. I am grateful to live in a country that doesn't have an epidemic of polio or diphtheria, and I know I can thank vaccines for that. Vaccines are up there with porcelain and the printing press on the list of wonderful, civilization-advancing inventions.</p>
<p>But the thing about vaccines -- and with all medical interventions -- is that every one of them requires an analysis of risk. In most cases, the risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine is known and is much, much lower than the risk of not getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>As one of the priority groups for a new vaccine, though, I'll be a guinea pig, and so will my fetus. I'll have to trust that the medical authorities, who are rushing to get this vaccine into production, have conducted enough research to be sure that the risk from the vaccine is lower than the risk of contracting H1N1 and suffering major complications.</p>
<p>That means I have to put my faith in people with more expertise than I have -- people under tremendous pressure to prevent a public-health disaster -- to make this calculation. Which means I have to ignore that little voice in my head that can't forget about all the times the experts have been wrong.</p>
<p>To this day, there's no official tally of how many people the 1976 swine-flu vaccine killed. Estimates peg it at 25. Only one person died from the flu itself. It's sobering to watch those public service announcements from 1976 and realize that the tone of absolute certainty was a front. Doctors like to appear certain, even when they're not.</p>
<p>As a case in point, the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends the use of the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir for pregnant women who contract H1N1, stating baldly, "Both drugs are effective in treating the H1N1 virus, and both are safe for pregnant women."</p>
<p>But the Centers for Disease Control -- while no less eager to recommend the drugs -- acknowledge that "no clinical studies have been conducted to assess the safety of these medications for pregnant women." They suggest that, "Because of the unknown effects of influenza antiviral drugs on pregnant women and their fetuses, oseltamivir and zanamivir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus."</p>
<p>How is it possible to know whether one risk outweighs the other, when the size of one of the risks is "unknown"? Granted, no one seems to have collected any data showing adverse reactions in pregnant women from these drugs, but I'm not eager to give my fetus drugs based on absence of evidence -- especially when I consider the track record the medical system has when it comes to pregnancy. Throughout the 20th century, the norm was prescribe first, study later.</p>
<p>There is a long history of doctors telling women: trust us. Trust us, you need to be etherized. Trust us, you need an episiotomy. Trust us, you need to be induced. Trust us, you need a C-section. Trust us, you need a hysterectomy. Trust us, diethylstilbestrol prevents miscarriages. (It doesn't, and gives women and their babies cancer.) Trust us, thalidomide cures morning sickness (and causes severe birth defects.)</p>
<p>So when my doctor or midwife asks me this fall whether I want the H1N1 vaccine, what will I answer?</p>
<p>Do I take it, knowing the risk of H1N1 is serious and hoping the risk from the vaccine isn't? Maybe. All I know at this point is that it's not going to be an easy decision. And that doesn't make me anti-science or anti-reason. It makes me, I hope, a good mother.</p>

<p>Arab health ministers on Wednesday agreed to restrict the elderly, children under 12 and the chronically sick from performing this year's hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia due to fears over the H1N1 flu virus. The total number of pilgrims at the hajj and the lesser umra pilgrimage will not be restricted by the kingdom, the Saudi health minister said, though numbers are expected to be lower.</p>

</p>
<p>The first Canadian case of swine flu that is resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu raises a red flag, but flu experts were still far from pushing the panic button on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The resistant virus was found in a 60-year-old Quebec man who was given a preventive dose of the antiviral as a precaution because he had a pulmonary condition.</p>
<p>The man and his son became ill, and researchers at a Quebec City laboratory discovered that the father had a new strain of drug-resistant H1N1.</p>
<p>It's believed the virus adapted to the drug and became resistant. There is no evidence the man transmitted the resistant virus to anyone else and he recovered quickly without going to hospital.</p>
<p>"It's one isolated case. We have to see what happens -- and if we do see more and more resistance coming up, then that would be concerning," said Dr. Susy Hota, an infectious-disease expert with the University Health Network in Toronto.</p>
<p>She said the use of Tamiflu to prevent infections can give rise to resistant strains of the virus.</p>
<p>So far, four other cases have been reported worldwide since the end of last month, in Japan, Denmark and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hota said it is reassuring that in all cases but one, patients had been taking Tamiflu to prevent infection when they developed the new strain.</p>
<p>"From what we've seen so far, this strain isn't very good at spreading from person to person," she said.</p>
<p>The new drug-resistant virus is raising concerns about the reliability of Tamiflu, the main weapon in the pandemic-drug arsenal of most countries, including Canada. There are only two antiviral drugs available, and Tamiflu makes up 80 per cent of the 50 million doses reserved for Canadians.</p>
<p>The other 20 per cent of the stockpile is the antiviral drug Relenza, which is harder to administer because it has to be inhaled into the lungs and cannot, for instance, be given to children.</p>
<p>Earl Brown, an influenza expert at the University of Ottawa, said this Canadian first calls for caution and a careful use of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>"This is something we expected. There is that concern that if you use it (antiviral drug) too much or inappropriately, you're going to start to get a H1N1 that is totally resistant," Brown said.</p>
<p>"We are relying a lot on the Tamiflu. Seeing these few cases of resistance sort of sharpened the knife and let people know well be more careful," he said.</p>

<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>As the World Health Organization warns of a resurgence of the H1N1 swine flu in the fall, only one Ottawa school board has a comprehensive pandemic plan to deal with a possible outbreak during the new school year.</p>
<p>Four months after the H1N1 flu virus first emerged in Mexico, the Ottawa Catholic School Board is the only one of the four boards with a detailed plan for everything from handling sick students to school evacuation and relocation as well as continuity of education. The other three, including the public Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, seem to be at different stages of their pandemic planning, working with Ottawa's public-health department to come up with a plan for September when schools reopen. The four school boards have a student population of more than 120,000. The OCDSB alone has more than 72,000 students in 150 schools.</p>
<p>Last month, when the Citizen asked the boards for their pandemic plans, all their spokespeople said they didn't have any, but would use the city's plan -- which itself says that each school board should have a plan of its own.</p>
<p>It turns out the Ottawa Catholic School Board has a plan and, on request, sent it to the Citizen.</p>
<p>But asked repeatedly whether they now have plans to deal with the possible crisis to come, spokespeople for the OCDSB and the Eastern Ontario French Language Public School Board sent similar e-mail statements to the Citizen.</p>
<p>"The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board continues to work in collaboration with Ottawa Public Health and other area school districts with respect to H1N1 strategies," spokeswoman Sharlene Hunter wrote. "We are monitoring the situation in order to ensure that we are prepared when students return to school on September 1."</p>
<p>Asked whether that meant the board doesn't now have a plan but is working on one, Hunter e-mailed back: "We are continuing to develop our plan with the assistance of the Public Health Unit and in collaboration with the other district boards of education."</p>
<p>The e-mail from Andrée Myette, communications co-ordinator of the Eastern Ontario French public board, read: "The Conseil des écoles publiques de l'Est de l'Ontario ... continues to work closely with Ottawa Public Health as well as the three other Ottawa-area school boards with respect to the H1N1 Influenza Pandemic Plan. We are continuing our monitoring of the situation in order to ensure that we are well prepared when our students return to school on Aug. 26, 2009."</p>
<p>She reiterated the statement when asked to clarify it.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the French Catholic Board said the board "had a document which was never used and is now being updated in the light of the current situation." Communications officer Céline Bourbonnais said in an</p>
<p>e-mail that the plan will be distributed to schools next month. Meanwhile, a training session for janitors will be held to review the best way to "clean and disinfect" schools to prevent the spread of the virus. An emergency-response committee is in place and "ready to meet as needed," and the board will work with Ottawa Public Health, she said.</p>
<p>The City of Ottawa's pandemic plan specifically asks individual organizations and institutions like school boards to draw up their own complementary plans so they know exactly how to handle their employees or students in an emergency.</p>
<p>Every organization has its own particular quirks and problems, and responses to the pandemic may vary. School boards, which have large numbers of small children under their care, may face different challenges than, say, a federal government department. And with the H1N1 virus seeming to affect the younger population more than other flu viruses, experts say school authorities need to get ahead of the problem.</p>
<p>Julian Hanlon, deputy director of the English Catholic school board, says that is exactly what his board is doing. Hanlon says the board's plan lays out in great detail what actions board officials will take during a pandemic, who is responsible for what, and what to do if a school has to be closed, evacuated or relocated. It has a continuity plan that spells out responsibilities, including who will step in for whom in case of illness.</p>
<p>The plan demands each school have a crisis-response plan with clear lines of authority and responsibilities, and alternate evacuation locations.</p>
<p>"Each principal shall list the two closest schools that may be used as an alternate location for emergency evacuation during a partial or complete closure of a school due to insufficient supervisory and/or operational personnel at the school," the plan says.</p>
<p>Because up to one in three people may be become ill enough to be quarantined or miss work during a severe pandemic, the plan also lays out a continuity plan for governing the board, maintaining a board headquarters and controlling finances.</p>
<p>While a solid foundation is firmly in place, Hanlon says, discussions with Ottawa public-health officials are continuing in order to adapt to what might be a fast-changing situation. He said a meeting between the health department and the school boards was held in June to draw up a strategy for summer school and camps, and another will be held next month to receive final directions for September.</p>
<p>Hanlon hopes that one of the things that would be sorted out at next month's meeting is whether schools open or remain closed. The World Health Organization has mooted the idea of school closings to stem the spread of the virus, but Hanlon said senior public-health officials in Canada have panned the idea.</p>
<p>"We have a definite plan in place and will convene in August and take lead from Public Health on where we go," he said.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Clinical trials in Australia are heating up the race to produce a swine flu vaccine, but a deal with a domestic manufacturer means Canada is no closer to giving anyone a shot in the arm.</p>
<p>Two biotechnology companies in Australia became the first in the world to begin injecting volunteers with their vaccines for the H1N1 influenza virus in separate clinical trials this week.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is also looking for volunteers so it can begin trials on two vaccines from manufacturers in Australia and France with the hope of beginning immunization by mid-October.</p>
<p>Even if all goes well with these products they cannot be used to protect Canadians from the pandemic that has so far contributed to at least 50 deaths nationwide.</p>
<p>That is because Ottawa signed a decade-long agreement with a pharmaceutical company in 2001 that ended up being sold to GlaxoSmithKline Inc.</p>
<p>The unique contract obligates the drug manufacturer to supply enough vaccine for essentially the entire population during a pandemic and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> will produce it at its plant in Ste.-Foy, Que.</p>
<p>Given the obvious aversion private companies have to sharing proprietary information, the deal also means that news about other countries beginning their human studies reveal next to nothing about how quickly Canadian volunteers will be recruited for testing here at home.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has made no formal announcement about trials here, but a spokesperson said yesterday the government has hope for the fall.</p>

<p>While we continue to observe a daily increase in the number of swine-flu cases across the country, we take comfort in the fact that our country has been preparing for a pandemic for years. It is true that we have an elaborate, expertly produced national pandemic plan, which in turn gave rise to provincial, territorial, regional and local plans. Canada has even been called a world leader in pandemic preparedness by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>But there is an inherent weakness in our pandemic planning that greatly undermines all the effort put into this enterprise, a weakness that might in the end be fatal.</p>
<p>In 2004, a Canadian pandemic plan was released that did not say a word about the amount of material and human resources that would be required for each of the hundreds of proposed pandemic measures, nor about who would provide these resources. When you stop to think about it, it's almost unbelievable: The largest public-health program ever proposed in our national history was launched without any budget or allocation of funds.</p>
<p>This economic blind-eye approach has resulted in our lack of readiness to care for those sick with the flu. The national plan for a moderate pandemic estimates that of 4.9 million people who will become ill, 109,000 people, about two per cent, will need to be admitted to a hospital. The plan does not suggest how these additional patients could be accommodated given the fact that in Canada we have just over 100,000 beds and that they are 90 per cent full all the time. And not any kind of hospital bed will do.</p>
<p>Because the most frequent serious complication of any flu is pneumonia, and in some cases the inability to breathe, these flu patients will require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit to survive. This fact was foreseeable, and it is well-known that these beds (with ventilators) are constantly scarce, yet no provisions were made to at least partially remedy the shortage.</p>
<p>A recent situation in Winnipeg highlighted how ill-prepared our hospitals are. In mid-June, at the very beginning of the H1N1 flu outbreak, when the province had only 119 confirmed cases, 31 of them needed ventilators. Winnipeg hospitals were forced to cancel non-urgent surgery, discharge other patients earlier and order 15 additional ventilators.</p>
<p>The fact is that the health-care delivery system in Canada is stretched to its limits. Under these circumstances, how can hospitals, pressed to avoid deficits and having no dedicated funding for a pandemic even now when a pandemic is here, engage in serious preparation for increased demand?</p>
<p>So all of us are closing our eyes to the unpleasant, unmanageable reality and hoping that, somehow, we will get through this. This is of course not the stuff of press releases, so the public is largely kept in the dark.</p>
<p>As someone who has promoted for years the idea that the hospital is a moral community, that has an ethical responsibility to our patients, our staff and also the people in the region we serve, I find it impossible to stay silent. There is a need for political decisions.</p>
<p>I have recommended to our hospital that we should determine what resources we need to provide care at the height of the pandemic to all patients who can be reasonably expected to rely on us. We should then notify our funding agency and include an estimate of the potential human cost of not having the necessary resources. If funding is not received, our hospital has an obligation to inform the public about the lack of resources.</p>
<p>If we fail to do this we will have an ethical responsibility for the harm or deaths that could have been prevented. Our funding authority, considering all the needs, may not be able to provide the resources, and may be able to justify that. What I suggest is not a pressure tactic, but a process that is necessary if we wish to respect the values of accountability, inclusiveness and transparency.</p>
<p>If given a choice, would Canadians want our health-care system to go through the pandemic with no additional resources, scaling down care to what the regular budget provides? Or would they be prepared to pay for the best possible care, knowing that the deaths that will occur were humanly unavoidable?</p>

<p>Air Canada may need a radical overhaul to thrive again, but opinions differ on whether it will have to file for bankruptcy protection any time soon.</p>
<p>Air Canada, like many airlines, is reeling from a steep drop in air travel triggered by the global recession and a general reluctance to fly because of the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>But Canada's largest carrier faces an extra measure of pain by virtue of its competition with <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span> . Its domestic rival has a far lower cost structure than Air Canada and isn't saddled with a $2.9 billion pension fund deficit it must cover.</p>
<p>The core of Air Canada's dilemma is how it can shrink its costs by altering long-term affiliate contracts, finding debt relief or cutting jobs. Is a bankruptcy the most effective way of achieving that goal? There is more wiggle room under a bankruptcy filing. Pensions and benefits are still protected, but unions could agree to cuts demanded by lenders, as happened during Air Canada's previous bankruptcy filing six years ago. Under recent deals with its unions, Air Canada cannot cut benefits or pensions for 21 months, up to April 2011.</p>
<p>Jacques Kavafian, airline analyst at Research Capital in Toronto, says a trip to bankruptcy court is part of the answer. He believes Air Canada is getting a raw deal in long-term contracts with domestic feeder airline Jazz Air and loyalty program manager Aeroplan. He argues the airline needs to break its contract with Jazz and set up an interline or code-sharing agreement with it which would automatically cut Air Canada's costs by $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Similarly Air Canada's relationship with Aeroplan costs it several hundred million dollars in profits.</p>
<p>"This is major surgery that we believe can only be achieved through CCAA [bankruptcy protection under the Companies' Creditor Arrangement Act] because it will require a renegotiation of contracts," Kavafian said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>Kavafian believes Air Canada, which he predicts will lose $1.1 billion in 2009 and $672 million in 2010, needs to make "substantial" job cuts to slash expenses, including cutting a quarter of its capacity in Canada and the U.S. to focus on profitable routes.</p>
<p>Air Canada's Chief Executive Calin Rovinescu has said that returning the airline to profitability would require a "fundamental restructuring." But he told the Globe and Mail that he didn't believe an airline could be shrunk to profitability especially if it had a high cost structure.</p>
<p>"So, instead of looking at the negativity, of saying we're going to become smaller and smaller and smaller, and have more layoffs, my expectation is to find creative route opportunities, to find new markets, to find additional areas where we can deploy capacity,'' Rovinescu said.</p>
<p>"There will be times where we'll shrink, for sure. But, we're not looking at massive shrinkage. We're not looking at reducing the airline by half and having massive layoffs.'' -- Reuters</p>

<p>AMERICAN CHARGED WITH ATTACKING BASE</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - An American man has been charged with attacking a U.S. base abroad and providing information about New York's subway and transport grid to the al-Qaida terror network, according to declassified court documents Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bryant Neal Vinas, described by U.S. media as a 26-year-old man born in the United States, pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him after his arrest last November. He has been detained since his arrest.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the U.S. government said that "in or about September 2008, the defendant fired rockets at a U.S. military base in Afghanistan," and that between March and November 2008, Vinas did "knowingly, intentionally and with malice aforethought conspire to kill one or more nationals of the United States."</p>
<p>With regard to the New York charges, the court documents said Vinas provided "materiel support and resources ... including expert advice and assistance" derived from his specialized knowledge of the city's transit system and the Long Island railroad.</p>
<p>According to the documents, Vinas travelled abroad and received "a military-type training from and on behalf of a foreign terrorist interrogation, to wit al-Qaida."</p>
<p>The New York Times reported Wednesday that Vinas was arrested in Pakistan where he had received the al-Qaida training.</p>

<p>The fire moved down a hill outside the southern city and threatened the Trois-Ponts district where residents sprayed water on the outside of their houses before they were ordered to leave.</p>
<p>People in neighbouring La Barasse were also ordered out.</p>
<p>A thick black smoke swirled around the district and many residents angrily criticized the French army which had staged artillery training at its Carpiagne camp just before the fire started.</p>
<p>The fire brigade said about 400 hectares of brush had been razed by the blaze.</p>
<p>STUDENTS IN SWINE FLU QUARANTINE</p>
<p>PARIS - Sixty-four foreign teenagers have been quarantined at summer schools in the Paris region after testing positive for swine flu, regional authorities said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"They are mostly young Spaniards, aged 15 to 18," said Henri Welschinger, an official at La Salle Saint-Nicolas Catholic school in Issy-les-Moulineaux, where 47 cases have been identified among a group staying on a language trip.</p>
<p>Several British and American teenagers were also part of the group, according to an official at the prefecture.</p>
<p>The 47 cases of A(H1N1) influenza have all been confirmed since Monday, the prefecture said. "None are in a worrying condition," Welschinger said, adding that the teens have been assigned to a single floor of the building.</p>
<p>"There is no reason to be worried. People behave as if it is the plague, but it is only the flu. We just need to take certain precautions," he added.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, authorities also confirmed 17 cases among a group of Italian teens staying at a language school at Rueil-Malmaison west of the capital.</p>
<p>FATAL BLAZE CAUSED BY FAULTY TV</p>
<p>LONDON - A massive fire in a high-rise public housing block which killed six people in London this month was caused by an old television set, police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officers had been treating the blaze at the 12-storey 1960s tower block in Camberwell, south London, as suspicious.</p>
<p>Among those killed by the blaze on July 3 were a three-week-old baby and her mother. Many residents who did escape complained that escape routes were inadequate.</p>
<p>"Initial results have found that the cause of the fire was an electrical fault originating in a portable TV set that was at least 10 years old," Detective Inspector Rick Murphy of London police said.</p>
<p>The others killed in the fire were a mother and her two children aged six and three, plus a 31-year-old woman.</p>
<p>BOSNIA MASSACRE VICTIMS FOUND</p>
<p>SARAJEVO - Forensic experts on Wednesday found the first remains of some 200 Bosnian civilians executed by Serb forces 17 years ago in a wartime massacre, an official said.</p>
<p>About 15 bodies were found at the bottom of the 250 metre Koricanske Stijene ravine in central Bosnia, Amor Masovic of the Missing Persons Commission told AFP.</p>
<p>"It is not a classic mass grave. People were shot dead, thrown from the top of the cliff and their bodies are lying on the ground," he said.</p>
<p>The area is not accessible by foot, Masovic said, and experts had to use climbing equipment to reach the remains which will have to be carried out in bags, he added.</p>
<p>In August 1992, Serb forces took more than 200 Muslim and Croat prisoners from detention camps around Prijedor, about 180 kilometres northwest of Sarajevo.</p>
<p>The victims were forced to kneel at the edge of the cliff, shot by a firing squad and the bodies pushed into the ravine, according to accounts from 12 people who survived.</p>
<p>In March 2004, a UN war crimes tribunal sentenced Darko Mrdja, a former member of Bosnian Serb police unit, to 17 years' prison for his role in the shootings.</p>
<p>The tribunal sentenced wartime Prijedor mayor Milomir Stakic to 40 years imprisonment for charges including the execution of prisoners at Koricanske Stijene.</p>
<p>This month a Bosnian court jailed a former Serb military policeman for 14 years over his role in the massacre.</p>
<p>At the start of the 1992-1995 war, Serb forces captured around two thirds of Bosnian territory including Prijedor, killing many Muslims from towns as part of an "ethnic cleansing" campaign. About 100,000 people were killed in the war.</p>
<p>POLISH HERO MAY BE IN SECRET GRAVE</p>
<p>WARSAW - The secret grave of one of Poland's national heroes may have been found more than 50 years after he was executed by his own country's Stalinist regime.</p>
<p>Scientists and historians intend to examine a plot of land in a Warsaw cemetery to see if it contains a mass grave that might include the body of Gen. Emil August Fieldorf, a Polish wartime commander hanged by the communist state in 1953.</p>
<p>If the grave is identified the authorities may carry out one of the biggest exhumations in the nation's history.</p>
<p>The possibility that Fieldorf's body, and those of others murdered by the regime, is in the cemetery was raised after historians at the Institute of National Memorial, the body charged with investigating communist crimes, found a note written by a gravedigger in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>It indicated that Fieldorf's remains may have been dumped in the grave after his execution. "I cannot say for certain we have found the grave of Gen. Fieldorf but we have identified a plot where 248 murdered Polish patriots are," said the Polish historian Jacek Pawlowicz. If researches do find the general's remains, he could be given a state funeral.</p>
<p>Fieldorf, who had German ancestors, was in the Polish army defeated by the Nazis in 1939. Initially interned, he escaped to France through Hungary and joined the newly formed Polish Armed Forces in the West.</p>
<p>Eventually he was parachuted back into German-occupied Poland, where, operating under the nom de guerre Nil, he led a number of daring raids against enemy forces.</p>
<p>Fieldorf was arrested by Soviet forces at the end of the war and sent to a labour camp. He returned to Poland in 1947 and lived under an assumed name, fearing communist reprisals against officers linked to the wartime government.</p>
<p>But in 1950 he accepted an offer of amnesty from the Stalinist regime. It was a ruse. Fieldorf was arrested, thrown into jail on trumped up charges and subjected to prolonged physical and psychological torture in a fruitless attempt to extract a "confession."</p>
<p>Fieldorf was unable to stand when, in 1952, a kangaroo court condemned him as a "Hitlerite-fascist" and sentenced him to death.</p>
<p>ANOTHER RUSSIAN ACTIVIST FOUND DEAD</p>
<p>MOSCOW - The body of a human rights activist who went missing two months ago, has been found in Carelia, northwest Russia, the group he worked for said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Andrei Kulagin, who had been investigating conditions in prison, disappeared on May 14, said rights group Spravedlivost (Justice) in a statement.</p>
<p>His body was found on July 10 in a sand pit near Petrozavodsk, the capital of Carelia, the movement's leader Andrei Stolbunov told AFP.</p>
<p>A police source in Carelia confirmed the discovery of the body but said he did not know if the victim worked for the rights group, Interfax reported.</p>
<p>According to this source, Kulagin had a criminal record for "hooliganism."</p>
<p>Spravedlivost investigates corruption and offers legal aid to citizens.</p>
<p>This latest development follows the murder of award-winning rights activist Natalya Estemirova in Russia's troubled north Caucasus last week.</p>

<p>RIO DE JANEIRO - Eight people were killed and 22 injured when the bus they were on plunged off a bridge in northeastern Brazil, Globo television reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The accident occurred Tuesday night near the town of Feira de Santana, in the state of Bahia.</p>
<p>Police said the vehicle fell from a height of 15 metres after the driver lost control and broke through a safety barrier.</p>

<p>AFGHAN BOMB BLASTS CLAIM 3 SOLDIERS</p>
<p>A bomb blast killed two U.S. soldiers and another claimed a British soldier on Wednesday in southern Afghanistan, the NATO-led force and U.S. military said, as foreign casualties hit record levels amid a surge in Taliban-linked violence.</p>
<p>Western military casualties have hit record levels in Afghanistan as foreign governments scramble extra troops to the war-torn nation hoping to ease an increasingly virulent Taliban insurgency ahead of elections on Aug. 20.</p>
<p>There are about 90,000 foreign troops -- mainly US, British and Canadian -- deployed in Afghanistan on a mission to stabilize the country with the Taliban insurgency at its deadliest since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.</p>
<p>The two U.S. deaths brings to at least 30 the number killed in combat in July, the deadliest month of the war for U.S. forces.</p>
<p>The British soldier's death brings to 188 the number of British troops who have died since operations against the Taliban extremists began in October 2001.</p>
<p>Of these, at least 156 were killed as a result of hostile action.</p>
<p>Nineteen British troops have died this month alone.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Searching for the next great killer species</b>
</div><div>Susan Riley   </div>

<div>833 words</div><div>23 July 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>I cycled past a dead crow the other day and was hit by a powerful wave of nostalgia: whatever happened to the eco-scares of yesteryear, I wondered? Shouldn't we all be dead by now?</p>
<p>They used to be as reliable (and as hair-raising) as summer blockbusters at the local Cineplex -- horrifying tales of invasive foreign species that were undermining native ecology and, in the worst cases, threatening human life. These alarming forecasts arrived reliably every spring and, as far as I could tell, were largely spread by newspapers and television newscasts.</p>
<p>This year, nothing. Or hardly anything. Another sign, perhaps, of the declining influence of print journalism. There is passing reference in a recent Globe and Mail story to a new "killer shrimp" -- the bloody red mysid, a tiny aquatic creature recently spotted in the Great Lakes, that is said to be "ravenous," and to "travel in packs." All the elements, in other words, of a great eco-scare: sinister "alien" origins, creepy name, prolific reproduction, insatiable appetite. Alas, Googling the words "killer shrimp" mostly turns up recipes from California seafood joints.</p>
<p>As for dead crows, they were associated with the 1999 discovery of West Nile virus in New York City -- Africa, apparently, being an inexhaustible wellspring of gruesome diseases. The virus was actually spread by mosquitoes, not crows, and it killed hundreds of people in the United States at its peak in 2003.</p>
<p>There were victims in Canada, too, although fatalities have been declining markedly. Indeed, four of five people bitten by infected mosquitoes experience no symptoms at all, a factoid usually relegated to the scare story's fine print. (Not that I'm suggesting these imported illness don't cause tragedy; just that their impact is invariably oversold.)</p>
<p>There are still occasional cases of West Nile reported and, anywhere there are mosquitoes, lingering concerns. The specific culprit -- the Culex tarsalis mosquito --prefers hot weather, which hasn't been an issue this summer. "Often on a nice warm evening, just as you're finishing the soccer game, you notice mosquitoes biting your ankles -- that's often Culex tarsalis," Saskatchewan provincial entomologist Phil Curry explained. (An obvious precaution: wear socks.)</p>
<p>My favourite eco-scare -- patient zero, perhaps, of the modern genre -- is killer bees. They were the product of a 1957 experiment-gone-wrong in Brazil, when 26 aggressive African Queen bees escaped a research compound, mated with milder European bees, and began a relentless expansion north. En route, they swarmed Mexican farmhands, killed innocent pets and dominated headlines in the early '90s.</p>
<p>Since then, they have lost their sting -- stalled at the Louisiana border by cold winters, their reputation rehabilitated, somewhat, by selective breeding and a name change. They are now called "Africanized bees" and lauded by beekeepers for their gentle nature. They are still creating a buzz, however, judging by the number of sports teams bearing the moniker Killer Bees.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes remains a cauldron of unwelcome visitors -- home, by some estimates, to at least 57 alien species.</p>
<p>The most famous is the zebra mussel, still cutting swimmers' feet, clogging pipes and temporarily disabling nuclear power plants around Lake Ontario. The ugliest is the round goby, described as an extremely aggressive bottom-feeder that even eats zebra mussels. Because this frankenfish, with its buggy eyes and mottled colour, is prone to botulism, it can infect other unlucky species, including loons, that order goby for lunch.</p>
<p>Since 2006, freighters entering the Great Lakes have been required to flush their ballast, which is intended to slow or halt the introduction of non-native invaders -- although how any species can survive the industrial pollution in the Great Lakes is a scientific wonder in itself. Humans, after all, have done more damage than any hapless mollusk.</p>
<p>On land, the invasive purple loosestrife -- that vivid popsicle of colour waving brightly from every country ditch -- remains on the watch-list, despite the introduction of two leaf-eating beetles, a root-mining weevil and a seed weevil, intended to contain its spread.</p>
<p>In Charlottetown, P.E.I., two women have been hired to dig up loosestrife along the city's Confederation Trail this summer. The work is supported by the federal Invasive Alien Species Partnership, a program also helping Nova Scotia scientists and university students monitor the rugged coastline of Cape Breton. They are girding for a multi-pronged assault: watching for European green crab, Asian shore crab, Chinese mitten crab, Japanese skeleton shrimp, lacy crust bryozan, sea squirts, oyster thief or dead man's fingers, spineycreek crayfish and rock snot.</p>
<p>Maybe the media have exhausted the annual allotment of alarming headlines on the swine flu -- now menacing summer camps, faithful to any Hollywood script -- and the recession. But you'd think dead man's fingers would at least warrant a mention.</p>

<p>Expanding a business? Motivating your team? Wondering how to be a better person?</p>
<p>We asked some of Canada's entrepreneurial go-getters to share three issues they are chewing on at the moment.</p>
<p>We'd like you to share with us, too. Tell us who you are, where you live and three things you are thinking about, and be sure to attach a photo. Click here to send us your information and photo. (nhulsman@globeandmail.com)</p>
<p>Jodi Hosking</p>
<p>Jodi Hosking is the president and co-founder of the Learning Traveller, an educational travel company that specializes in immersion programs and language learning holidays for teens, gap-year students and mature travellers 50 and older. My husband, Cam Harvey, and I established the company in 2003 on Vancouver Island and in 2006 we relocated to Ontario to be closer to our key markets in Toronto and New York and our partners in Europe. In 2008 we won the Language Travel Magazine industry award for best agency in North America and were shortlisted for the same award in 2009. We live in Guelph with our 10-year-old son who thinks one day he might like to run the business.</p>
<p>Three things on my mind are:</p>
<p>How to continue growing our business without adding heavily to our infrastructure. Ours is a very service-heavy business and when we increase our client numbers we need to hire more support staff. I’m trying to determine the critical client and staff numbers for the most viable business model. How to let go of controlling every little aspect of our business while still maintaining the highest possible levels of service. Like a lot of entrepreneurs, I am a bit of a control freak but as the business grows it is impossible to have a hand in everything we do. I’m lucky to have great people on staff but learning to hand over responsibility remains one of my biggest personal challenges. Selecting partners to deliver our overseas programs. We are only as good as the programs our clients attend so choosing the right partner organisations to work with continues to be the most important part of what we do.</p>
<p>Matthew Slutsky</p>
<p>Matthew Slutsky is president and co-founder of the Toronto-based Web startup BuzzBuzzHome (www.buzzbuzzhome.com[http://www.buzzbuzzhome.com]), an online and map based listing service for new condominiums, homes and townhouses. The site launched in early 2009 and has quickly grown to drawing more than 30,000 visitors a month, actively searching for new homes. Matt first conceived of the idea for BuzzBuzzHome while working as VP Development for a Toronto land-developer/builder, and became frustrated with the lack of a publicly accessible online listing of all new residential developments.</p>
<p>BuzzBuzzHome provides users searching for their new home with engaging features such as map based search results, a social media driven ‘virtual hangout’ for each new project called ‘the hive’, and a game based editable wiki whereby users collect points by contributing content to the site.</p>
<p>Three things on Matt’s mind are:</p>
<p>As a Web-based company, how to maintain our edge amid a rapidly evolving Internet. How to remain true to our core business model and vision, while maintaining growth and engaging new technologies and ideas. How to recruit, train and manage computer engineers when I myself cannot code a thing.</p>
<p>Alex Rechichi</p>
<p>Alex Rechichi is president and co-founder of the Extreme Pita and Mucho Burrito restaurants, which are part of Extreme Brandz Inc. Since opening the first Extreme Pita in Waterloo, Ont., with his brother Mark, the pair have launched more than 250 franchised restaurants across North America and are looking to expand internationally by 2010. Mr. Rechichi was a Top 40 Under 40 award recipient in 2008, and was named Foodservice and Hospitality’s Entrepreneur of the Year in 2006. A father of three, Alex is based in Mississauga, where he grew up.</p>
<p>Three things on his mind are:</p>
<p>“The slow economy has started a price war in the restaurant business. We have lost some customers, but history shows price wars are short-lived. The quick-service restaurant industry is fighting for its share of wallet; all we can do is focus on our core business.”“Today, more than ever, restaurants have to be open and transparent. It’s not the first time the restaurant business has been hit with difficulties. We’ve survived SARS, the avian flu, mad cow disease and now the H1N1 virus. This is just another episode and something we need to endure, but those who are prepared can survive through it.”“Competition is no longer in marketing, but more about promises you make to the customers, and making sure those promises are executed at every location. Our best strategy is to build awareness, get people to try our products, and they eventually become users.”</p>
<p>Trina Boos</p>
<p>Trina Boos is the face behind Ad Lounge, a digital network for advertising and marketing executives in Toronto. Her organization creates events that help marketers and agencies stay connected.</p>
<p>Three things on her mind:</p>
<p>“I can relate so much to the digital marketing content provider One Degree closing. Although Ad Lounge is different in nature, it is difficult for any digital content provider, especially after corporations started cutting sponsorship. It is a tough time to be an underdog in Canada.” “As an entrepreneur, you have to stay optimistic during the tough days. At the same time, you have to be pro-active to keep the phone ringing.” “I really want to take a vacation, but it is very difficult to take a month off when you have to feed new content to your network.”</p>
<p>Leila Boujnane</p>
<p>Leila Boujnane is chief executive officer and co-founder of Toronto-based Idée Inc., which develops advanced image-search software. Ms. Boujnane also has held positions in international organizations in the commercial and public sectors.</p>
<p>Three things on her mind:</p>
<p>“Making money. As CEO of a software firm you would think this would be totally obvious. Not always!” “How can I apply my skills to help others without diluting the main focus of my business?” “Where can I find free time to travel more?”</p>
<p>Mike Brcic</p>
<p>Mike Brcic, 38, turned his love of mountain biking into a business. Founded in British Columbia and now based in Toronto, Sacred Rides Mountain Bike Adventures offers trips in Canada and abroad. The company offers eight destinations, including Utah, Guatemala, Peru and Chile. Mr. Brcic says some of these destinations were chosen not only for their mountain biking appeal but also because they are more far-off parts of the world. Mr. Brcic also founded and is acting as the executive director of Bikes Without Borders, which is raising funds to get bikes to community workers in Malawi. Mr. Brcic rides a DeVinci Remix SL5.</p>
<p>Three things on his mind are:</p>
<p>“G.A.P Adventures chief executive officer Bruce Poon Tip told me that the best way to motivate employees is to make sure they know there is a higher purpose in what they are doing. How can I motivate my employees and customers to believe in our social and environmental commitment?”“How do I develop partnerships? The most challenging part is finding those people and developing a relationship with them without using up so much of my time. Managing time is also the hardest part in making sure that I continue growing Sacred Rides while also growing Bike Without Borders.”“How can we expand to other types of sports tours without diluting our focus in mountain biking?”</p>
<p>Darius Bashar</p>
<p>Darius Bashar is president and co-founder of DailyChallenge.org, a social networking site that encourages users to make positive changes for the community while connecting corporations to causes they can support. DailyChallenge is the organizer behind “Pay It Backward Day” in Ontario. On Sept. 30, more than 170 Second Cup locations will participate in the event by donating $5 to Sick Kids hospital each time a person buys coffee or tea for the person behind them. Before launching DailyChallenge, Darius was a senior web strategist and partner with Apollo Media, a social-media strategies agency.</p>
<p>The three things on his mind are:</p>
<p>How can we inspire 3,000 Ontario residents to participate in Pay It Backward Day?Our social network of “Do Gooders” has incredible support in the GTA and Ontario. How can we expand our reach to connect with change makers across North America – taking our platform and initiatives to the next level, ultimately leading to positive change in our world?How do we go about creating our “Army of Do Gooders”?</p>
<p>Chris Winter</p>
<p>Chris Winter, 37, is a Vancouver-based adventure travel tour operator specializing in cycling trips around the globe. In 1972 his parents started Cycleventures Bicycle Tours, a road biking company that Mr. Winter has since taken over. He’s also started his own version for mountain bikes, Big Mountain Bike Adventures. “I’ve created my dream job, which I’m very proud of – there’s never a dull moment.”</p>
<p>Three things that I’m thinking about:</p>
<p>“I’m constantly thinking of creative ways to market our product with a limited budget.”“As my business matures and our sector of travel grows, I need to stay ahead of bigger companies who want a piece of what I’ve started.”“Making money. It sounds obvious, but I’m an ideas person and having a plan in place to increase profit has never been on the top of my list. This has to change.”</p>
<p>Adrian Salamunovic</p>
<p>Adrian Salamunovic is the co-founder of DNA 11, a concept-art producer that generates canvases depicting individuals’ unique DNA patterns. Customers send in a DNA sample using a cheek swab.</p>
<p>Mr. Salamunovic and a friend started DNA 11 with only $2,000 but sold $40,000 worth of DNA portraits in the first month. The company then hit $1-million in sales in the first year. Mr. Salamunovic spent a decade in business technology, specializing in high-tech marketing and design, before starting DNA 11 in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The three things on his mind now are:</p>
<p>Launching CanvasPop.com and going live – it’s our new sister company that will take any photo and print it on canvas. It’s exciting to launch a business off the back of DNA 11 and I can’t wait to see it live. Our charity program we’re launching called DNA for Charity. We’re getting celebrities to donate their DNA and we make a portrait out of it. We sell the portrait through eBay’s Giving Works program and all the proceeds go to charity. The first celebrity is Elijah Wood, who is helping raise money for the children’s charity the Art of Elysium.Growth, growth, growth. Even with the global economy in a rut, we’re focused on growth right now. We are looking at putting together a world-class board of advisers to help push us to the next level. I think it is a great time to be thinking about growth because it’s easier to hire and in general everything is available at reduced prices.</p>
<p>Sean Moffitt</p>
<p>Sean Moffitt is president of the word-of-mouth marketing company Agent Wildfire. After leaving the corporate world, he now promotes his clients with more grassroots, conversational and social strategies than his traditional marketing past. He also leads an online network of 1,800 top Canadian business minds through the irreverently titled “The League of Kickass Business People.”</p>
<p>Three things on his mind:</p>
<p>“I’m obsessed with what makes ideas spread, people talk, influencers to get involved and customers to purchase. I’ve captured these learnings from the last five years on my personal blog, Buzz Canuck, and now I’m also in the midst of authoring a book about them.”“I’m also always thinking about ‘what’s next’ – there’s a sense of energy and enlightened insight that I and my staff share about being involved in things that are about to break versus operating in the generally accepted mainstream. I believe constantly retooling and staying abreast of these market and cultural shifts, particularly in this temperamental economy, is key to maintaining value and building relevance in your personal brand.”“One of my personal passions is an active life – fitness, health, outdoors, sports, play, adventure. I focus a lot of time outside the office on parlaying a variety of active pursuits with the Web experience, now manifested in our just-launched site, www.gengo.ca[http://www.gengo.ca], a local hub for anybody who likes to spend life off the couch.”</p>
<p>Mi Young Kim</p>
<p>Mi Young Kim, president of Earl Warren Travel Agency in Toronto, is determined to survive. She took over the agency and kept most of its existing clients and also added the South Korean community as her main clientele. Unlike smaller travel agencies serving only the Korean community, all her staff members are required to speak English fluently as a second language and be certified as a travel agent.</p>
<p>The three things on her mind:</p>
<p>The travel industry is dwindling with more people making arrangements online. How can I differentiate our business from online services?I don’t expect to make big changes but still want steady growth for the business. What can I do to attract more people to trust and continue to use our services?I want to manage my business and family life so both will be healthy.</p>
<p>Mike O’Mahoney</p>
<p>Mike O’Mahoney is founder and principal of MWO Philanthropic Advisors, helping non-profits with their fundraising activities. He has led fundraising initiatives for 27 years for American universities, academic medical centres, major hospitals and, most recently, the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation in Toronto.</p>
<p>Three things on his mind:</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking of how not-for-profits are constrained by expense/revenue ratios that our society uses to measure their effectiveness. How can a not-for-profit take a chance on a new program that might have a huge benefit for all of us if they are penalized if they fail? By holding an organization to an expense/revenue ratio we might be seriously limiting an organization’s benefit to society.I’m trying to understand how to allocate resources between fundraising programs. For example, what’s the right mix for investments in mail, phone, events, and major gifts? I think we need simulations or models to show us what the impact would be if we change our investment in different fundraising programs – and what the result would be if we invested more money in fundraising.I’m thinking about the word “charity” and how it is the wrong word for not-for-profits. It implies helpless and needy. Good not-for-profits are neither; they are committed to making a difference in our world and should use the best business practices to seek investment. The whole point for a not-for-profit is how it is affecting the world, and that deserves the attention of our very best minds, talent, and resources.</p>
<p>Karen Thompson</p>
<p>Karen Thompson, 55, mother of 3, lives in Kelowna, B.C. A veteran of the banking industry and the Urban Development Institute, she founded Canada 1 Property Pages in early 2008. It is designed to be an affordable alternative to realtor.ca (formerly MLS), offering advanced features such as a choice of searches and mapping, profile matching and alerts, and mobile services. Her focus is on providing new-home seekers access to the projects of builders and developers; many builders and developers use in-house sales teams rather than real estate agents, and therefore did not have have access to a central listing service.</p>
<p>Three things on her mind:</p>
<p>How do I gain access to someone in a major telecommunications company with whom I could sit down and discuss my business? It's important to have this "buy-in" - we have a "Classic" website but also a lighter, simpler mobile version that works on a smart phone, plus our iPhone App will be released this September. Our website is built on a powerful, dynamic platform with strong SEO tactics. How do I keep the momentum going with my cash-strapped, 1-1/2-year old business? It is built on relationships; we listened to builders/developers, agents and home seekers in putting together the site. It is recognized as a valued service, but my potential paying clients have a "let's wait and see if you are around in 3 years" attitude. I have fabulous staff. How do I keep all of us upbeat, positive and fully engaged in these uncertain times?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Will closing schools help fight H1N1 flu? - Health experts weigh options</b>
</div><div>By Nick Martin </div>

</p>
<p>The decision whether to close Manitoba schools this fall in response to the H1N1 flu pandemic will be made on a school-by-school basis, a top Manitoba Health official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Elise Weiss's comments came in response to a World Health Organization warning Tuesday that countries should consider closing their schools if a flu pandemic strikes this fall.</p>
<p>Weiss said Manitoba Health will take into account the spread and severity of the virus within Manitoba, as well as recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Canada and other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>"What we need to do in Manitoba is look at all these different sources of information and then just figure out what will work best here locally for our own specific situation," she said.</p>
<p>No specific number of H1N1 cases will necessarily act as a threshold that warrants the closing of a school, she said. "What's the extent of the disease there, how quickly is it being spread, what age groups is it affecting?"</p>
<p>Education Minister Peter Bjornson said school divisions already have plans to educate children at home in case of flooding or other natural disasters, and could implement those plans if schools close. Some online and interactive television courses are already used in the province.</p>
<p>Keith Thomas, risk manager for the Manitoba School Boards Association, said divisions will call their regional health authorities any time absences exceed 10 per cent of students.</p>
<p>But Thomas said some health experts question what benefit there would be to closing schools, if kids who weren't sick just spent the day hanging around the mall in even larger crowds.</p>
<p>British researchers writing in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases said on Monday that governments needed to draft plans for when and how to close schools if the swine flu pandemic worsens.</p>
<p>The paper argued that closing schools can help break the chain of transmission, slowing the pace of the disease, lessening the burden on health-care systems and reducing the peak in worker absenteeism. But the researchers also noted the considerable economic costs if parents are forced to stay home to look after their children.</p>
<p>During the recent outbreak, U.S. authorities recommended that affected schools close for two weeks if there was a suspected case, but when the virus turned out to be milder than feared, they switched to advising parents just to keep sick students home. Schools could still close if a large number of students and staff were out sick.</p>
<p>"The best place for healthy kids is in school, where they can learn, where they can be educated, and where many of them get breakfast and lunch," Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week.</p>
<p>"School closure is one of the mitigation measures that could be considered by countries," WHO spokeswoman Alphaluck Bhatiasevi told a news conference in Geneva Tuesday. "As WHO has been saying, different countries would be facing the pandemic at different levels at different times. So it is really up to countries to consider what mitigation measures suit them in regard to the situation in individual countries."</p>
<p>The University of Manitoba has contingency plans in place should the province order it to shut down, said vice-president of administration Deborah McCallum. "We would take our instructions from Manitoba Health -- they would be the ones who would determine if we would need to shut down."</p>
<p>McCallum said U of M has been developing a pandemic plan for the past three years to keep the university running if a significant number of staff are sick.</p>
<p>But, if the government orders U of M to close, she said, "We can't just lock our doors and walk away.</p>
<p>"We have resident students who have nowhere to go," especially international students. Students would need meals, cleaning, and maintenance services.</p>
<p>"We've got animal facilities. Research projects need to be tended to. Our powerhouse has to be tended 7/24 or our buildings will freeze up." U of M would also have to maintain its website, she said.</p>
<p>A University of Winnipeg official said it's pandemic plan is being updated.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Compensation plan needed along with shot; No time to have new vaccine properly tested</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- A public-health expert is calling on Canada to create a no-fault compensation program for people who may be harmed by a swine-flu vaccine that millions of Canadians will be urged by the government to get this fall.</p>
<p>Kumanan Wilson, Canada research chair in public health at the University of Ottawa, said that children and adults could be exposed to an incompletely tested vaccine and that a compensation scheme is needed to encourage the public to buy into any mass-immunization program.</p>
<p>When the World Health Organization last month proclaimed swine flu the first pandemic since 1968, Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, said everyone should get the new flu shot.</p>
<p>"The more people who have immunity, the easier it is to stop," he said.</p>
<p>But Canwest News Service has learned that, unlike the United States, the Public Health Agency of Canada has no plans to compensate people who may be injured by an H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>A vaccine-injury program would give people who suffer an adverse reaction faster access to compensation without having to go through the legal system. Quebec is the only jurisdiction that has a non-fault compensation program.</p>
<p>Public Health Agency of Canada officials acknowledge there won't be time for a swine-flu vaccine to go through standard safety testing before immunizations begin in autumn. The first doses are expected to be available in three to four months. Officials said they are working with regulators on ways to reduce any time required for getting the vaccine out.</p>
<p>An outbreak of swine flu at the Fort Dix army base in New Jersey in 1986 spawned a nationwide emergency vaccination program. Reports soon emerged of unusually high rates of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare, neurological disorder that can cause temporary paralysis.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying we shouldn't roll out this vaccine," said Wilson, an expert in pandemic planning.</p>
<p>But "there are going to be concerns about people not wanting to take the vaccine, health-care workers in particular," he said.</p>
<p>"We have been arguing that it needs to be complemented with a no-fault compensation program, just like in 1976" in the United States.</p>

</p>
<p>Two Canadian Food Inspection Agency inspectors appear to have contracted swine flu while investigating an outbreak of the virus in pigs on an Alberta farm in late April, the agency confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p>The cases appear to be the first reports of people catching the new H1N1 virus from pigs.</p>
<p>While the pandemic virus is of swine origin, it was found in people first. Pigs are not currently believed to be playing a role in ongoing transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>The agency said in emailed answers to questions that it's impossible to say with 100 per cent certainty that the inspectors were infected by the animals. But it is known the men did not use proper safety techniques while in the barn, apparently removing the N-95 respirators that covered their noses and mouths because they were hot.</p>
<p>"We conducted a review of the situation and determined that CFIA protocols for personal protection were not fully observed in this case," the agency's email said.</p>
<p>CBC TV also reported yesterday that one of the inspectors took a commercial flight to Winnipeg after he was infected. It was not clear whether the inspector had infected anyone else with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The agency said it doesn't intend to change protocols for conducting this type of investigation because its existing protocols, if complied with, would have been adequate to protect the workers.</p>
<p>The Alberta pig farm incident was the first report ever of this new virus being found in pigs. The source of the infection in the pigs remains a mystery and the handling of the case has been anything but smooth.</p>
<p>Officials at first identified a carpenter who worked briefly on the farm while ill with flu-like symptoms as being the source of the infection. But the man, who had recently returned from a trip to Mexico, was later told tests showed he was never infected with the virus.</p>
<p>Argentina has reported cases of person-to-pig transmission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it may take substantially longer to make the full quota of swine flu vaccine because efforts to improve the yield of the vaccine seed strains aren't bearing fruit.</p>
<p>Three of the laboratories involved in the work - in Britain and the U.S. - are sounding increasingly pessimistic the problem can be fixed in the short term.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>It may take substantially longer to make the full amounts of H1N1 flu vaccine countries have contracted to buy because efforts to improve the yield of the vaccine seed strains aren't bearing fruit, experts say.</p>
<p>Three of the laboratories involved in the work are sounding increasingly pessimistic that the yield problem can be fixed in the shortterm. Vaccine manufacturers have reported they are getting between 50 per cent and 75 per cent less vaccine with the new H1N1 virus asthey do when they make seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>"It's not looking very bright at the moment," John Wood, principal scientist atBritain's National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"In effect, it means if we continue like this, manufacturers will have to keep on producing (pandemic) vaccine for longer to make thenumber of doses needed."</p>
<p>The flu laboratories at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control have made three new seed strains and are in the process of completing thepaperwork needed to ship them to the manufacturers.</p>
<p>The head of the CDC's influenza division said while the new vaccine candidate viruses are growing well in the hands of her scientists,there's no guarantee they will produce a better yield when manufacturers start to work with them.</p>
<p>Dr. Nancy Cox said the issue isn't simply about growth, but also about how wellthe vaccine viruses hold up during the various steps ofthe manufacturing process.</p>
<p>"I think it is possible we won't have a better yielding virus," she admitted from Atlanta.</p>
<p>"(But) I think that it's still too early to say how this will impact the amountof vaccine that's available."</p>
<p>Each flu virus has its own characteristics and vaccine makers are accustomed toworking with new strains, fine-tuning processes to tryto coax maximum yield from a virus.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for vaccine giant Sanofi Pasteur said the company feels it hasn't yet exhausted efforts to improve the yield of the seed strain for the pandemic vaccine. Still, Len Lavenda suggested Sanofi doesn't expect those efforts to fully correct the problem.</p>
<p>"Although we think it's too soon to project what the final yield will be, we anticipate it will remain lower than seasonal vaccine yield," Lavenda said fromSanofi's headquarters in Swiftwater, Pa.</p>
<p>"Certainly if the yield doesn't increase, it means it will take longer to produce the vaccine. (But) I think at this point in time weremain hopeful thatwe'll be able to increase the yield and think it's premature to throw in the towel, so to speak."</p>
<p>The various companies making pandemic vaccine have been working with a seed strain produced at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y. Its laboratory pioneered the process of engineering vaccine viruses to maximize growth decadesago and scientists there have produced many of the vaccine seed strains used since.</p>
<p>Its first H1N1 flu seed strain was overwhelmingly viewed as the best yielder byvaccine manufacturers. But even at that, manufacturerssaid they got about halfof the yield generated with seasonal flu production. Doris Bucher, who heads the lab, says her team is tryingother options.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu pandemic planning underway; Canadian firms brace for possible crisis</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>

</p>
<p>Canadian companies and organizations are being urged in a new report to consider the swine-flu pandemic as a "business continuity crisis" and to put response plans in place now, before the fall flu season arrives.</p>
<p>The Conference Board of Canada report released this week examines the actions some organizations have already taken and provides advice on what should be included in pandemic response plans.</p>
<p>Many businesses in Canada developed plans following the severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) outbreak in 2002 and the emergence and spread of the avian flu, and those have been pulled from the shelves and dusted off since the swine-flu outbreak started in late April.</p>
<p>Those plans are now being tested and companies are determining how they can be applied to the swine-flu pandemic that has made more than 10,000 Canadians sick. The swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus, is expected to hit more Canadians in the fall months, which will mean many employees missing work.</p>
<p>Organizations have to be flexible and responsive to the latest information about the new flu illness, the report said, to protect their employees from getting sick and to react accordingly when and if they do fall ill.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>, for example, a company that has had two employees confirmed with swine flu, started developing a pandemic plan about three years ago and activated it in the spring when swine flu began to emerge. Adjustments, however, had to be made.</p>
<p>"We had actually been doing tests to make sure that the plans weren't just good on paper, that they could actually be activated," spokeswoman Jacqueline Michelis said in an interview. "We tweaked them and modified them when the H1N1 broke out."</p>
<p>Communication with employees is central to all the plans, said Michelis, and to that end Bell has been keeping staff up-to-date through internal e-mails and a pandemic website. It has also put up posters in company washrooms about proper hygiene and provided hand sanitizers. The company plans to host flu-shot clinics in the fall for its 42,000 employees.</p>
<p>Bell's business is designated by the government as part of the country's critical infrastructure and, as such, the company must have an emergency management plan, under which its pandemic plan falls.</p>
<p>"We have to be able to maintain service when something like this happens, so we have a team in place always," said Michelis.</p>
<p>The Conference Board report also emphasized the importance of communication and recommended that companies be careful in striking a balance between too many and too few messages to employees and to external stakeholders.</p>
<p>Other actions that should be taken, according to the report, include getting senior management involved in the response plans and identifying which employees can fill in for each other when people fall ill.</p>
<p>The report recognized that implementing pandemic response plans during a recession is an added challenge for organizations, but the report said there are "no excuses" to avoid preparations.</p>
<p>"While many organizations are struggling to stay in business, they must now also find the resources, attention, and capability to respond to this additional serious pressure," the report said. "While some organizations may argue that the costs of preparation are simply too high --particularly in a difficult economic environment--the risks they are taking may prove to be too great."</p>
<p>Companies that are lagging on their pandemic plans should keep their legal responsibilities in mind, the report notes, because if they fail to provide due diligence they could be held liable.</p>
<p>Reputations will also be on the line, especially for organizations that are part of a supply chain. If one organization isn't adequately prepared for the effect the pandemic could have, it could easily disrupt the whole chain.</p>
<p>The Conference Board report urges organizations to shift their thinking, if they haven't already, in preparation for the fall.</p>
<p>"Organizations would do well to begin shifting their thinking that this is a medical crisis and, therefore, belongs to the medical profession, and recognize that a pandemic is also an economic and business continuity crisis.</p>
<p>"As such, it needs as much leadership from the business community as it does from pandemic specialists," the report said.</p>

</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Tuesday two of its employees, who later developed swine flu, failed to follow safety procedures when investigating an H1N1 outbreak at a central Alberta pig farm this spring.</p>
<p>Officials with the federal agency said it appears the workers took off their protective masks when the equipment fogged up in the hog barn, despite protocols that called for the masks to remain in place throughout the investigation.</p>
<p>Within days, the two workers were diagnosed with H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>"There were previously established protocols that gave clear instructions about what safety precautions needed to be taken, but we know those procedures weren't followed," said Dr. Jim Clark, national manager of the agency's disease control section.</p>
<p>"We've taken steps to correct the situation."</p>
<p>The federal Liberals said on Tuesday the breach of safety procedures while investigating a disease outbreak is "unbelievable.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine the CFIA would not have the proper garments and apparatus to ensure their workers were protected," said Wayne Easter, the Liberal's agriculture critic.</p>
<p>"This should not have happened."</p>
<p>The two employees were among three agency workers--a veterinarian and two inspectors--who were investigating the suspected outbreak of H1N1, which was later confirmed in a large hog operation near Rocky Mountain House.</p>
<p>The vet and the two inspectors were collecting samples from pigs in the herd to test for the new virus. Clark could not say which of the three employees were later diagnosed with H1N1.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency had a protocol for fitting workers with respirators, coveralls, gloves and taking other precautions, like taping sleeves to protect employees during investigations.</p>
<p>However, Clark said the equipment was either not worn--or not maintained-- appropriately. He said the masks began fogging in the heat of the barns and it appears the workers lifted the respirators.</p>
<p>He said the agency has taken steps to ensure investigators are thoroughly trained and committed to following proper safety procedures.</p>

<p>Inspectors got swine flu while on pig farm visit</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has confirmed that two of its inspectors caught swine flu in late April while investigating an outbreak on an Alberta pig farm.</p>
<p>The cases appear to be the first reports of people catching the new H1N1 virus from pigs, though the agency says it can't be 100 per cent certain the two caught it from the pigs.</p>
<p>A report into the incident reveals the inspectors didn't take the necessary safety precautions, at one point removing their protective masks while in the barn taking swabs from pigs.</p>
<p>Alberta hospital censured for recycling syringes</p>
<p>A quality review says isolation and old habits were the main reasons that a northern Alberta hospital recycled syringes that were meant to be used only once.</p>
<p>The government asked the Health Quality Council of Alberta to investigate after it was discovered last year that the High Prairie Health Complex was reusing syringes to inject medicine into intravenous lines.</p>
<p>The council says isolated medical staff in the reasonably remote community were not being kept up to date on new developments.</p>
<p>The report recommends closer monitoring of such facilities and better training for staff.</p>
<p>Investigator Dr. John Cowell emphasized that the syringes were only used in intravenous tubes -- not directly on patients -- so the danger of infection was real but small.</p>

</p>
<p>The report into last year's deadly listeriosis outbreak paints a disturbing picture of Canada's ability to deal with a serious national food-safety emergency.</p>
<p>Investigator Sheila Weatherill, former head of Capital Health, outlines a series of problems with packages of <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span> deli meat that spread a disease that made 57 people seriously ill and left 22 of them dead.</p>
<p>The concerns include Maple Leaf's erroneous conclusion that repeated occurrences of the bug at its big Toronto plant were under control, the lack of any requirement that employees tell Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials about the contamination, confusion between agencies and levels of government over who was in charge, and a failure to give timely public warnings outlining the danger to the elderly and the infirm.</p>
<p>While a protocol for co-ordinating the response to such an incident was endorsed by the federal, provincial and territorial governments in 2004, few executives involved in the outbreak even knew the protocol existed.</p>
<p>In one telling phrase, Weatherill writes "we were told that while front-line and scientific staff on both the public health and food safety sides of the investigation were hard at work responding to the crisis, their superiors were not initially fully engaged."</p>
<p>She takes aim at all the players for their part in the disaster, using words such as "inconsistent management," "confusion" and "void of leadership" to describe how departmental leaders dealt with what at first wasn't recognized as a severe food-borne emergency.</p>
<p>The food inspection agency comes in for particular criticism, performing only three of 12 quarterly audits at the Maple Leaf facility from 2005 to 2007, and leaving inspectors at the Bartor Road plant appearing stressed because they had to handle several sites under a new inspection system.</p>
<p>Although different agencies are involved, the reaction to this multi-jurisdictional outbreak raises worries about how well prepared we are for another potential public health nightmare, the much-feared H1N1 flu pandemic. Critics have complained the report was prepared in secret and given to the federal government one day before it was publicly released, but these are minor concerns compared to the need to follow up on the many recommendations for preventing an outbreak like this from happening again.</p>
<p>While the terms of reference didn't allow Weatherill to find fault, it appears there was plenty to share. As a start, the federal government must listen to Weatherill and commit to improved food safety as part of this fall's legislative agenda.</p>

<p>To them, it should therefore be left. Suggestions by some native advocates that aboriginal peoples be at the head of the queue when an effective antidote is developed may be considered, but the decision to vaccinate must be based on who is, and is not, most at risk.</p>
<p>At the moment, this would seem to be primarily older children and young adults, of all races. The case for aboriginal priority is based on environmental factors--crowded, poorly ventilated housing for instance, and high rates of degenerative diseases such as obesity and diabetes. While sadly all too real for many reserve dwellers, this prescription suggests all people living in substandard conditions and suffering from similar medical conditions should be advanced up the list, not merely those of aboriginal heritage.</p>
<p>That said, the discussion may prove to be irrelevant: While we do not recommend complacency, statistics do not seem to justify our present anxiety about H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>For, every year, new strains of the flu virus appear. H1N1 is but the latest and compared to the familiar strains of the disease, not especially dangerous.</p>
<p>According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, roughly 4,000 people die of run-of-the-mill influenza annually in this country, and 20,000 more are hospitalized. Yet, of the 94,512 cases reported worldwide by the World Health organization, only 429 have resulted in deaths --rather less than one half of one per cent of those known to be infected. In Canada, the numbers give even less cause for anxiety -- 25 dead out of 7,983 reported cases.</p>
<p>Thus, the attention given H1N1 flu by the WHO (and the Canadian government) must be seen as precautionary: H1N1's pandemic designation is based on the relative ease of transmission between people and its widespread occurrence, rather than on mortality.</p>
<p>Still, despite the low risks, the plan is to produce sufficient vaccine that all Canadians will ultimately have the opportunity of receiving a flu vaccination. The question of who gets it first arises only because the vaccine will become available in batches, meaning somebody must make a decision.</p>
<p>It is our hope that access to the vaccine does not become politicized, and that distribution is determined by exposure to risk, not by membership of a particular demographic.</p>
<p>At all events, anything that has the appearance of race-based preference should be scrupulously avoided as inconsistent with Canadian equality ideals.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1's oink is proving to be far worse than its bite; Latest flu outbreak is shaping up as fourth pandemic dud in the past six years</b>
</div><div>Dr. Richard Schabas   </div>
<div>Medical Officer of Health in Hastings and Prince Edward Counties</div>

</p>
<p>Toronto is gripped in a frenzy of worry about the dreaded "second wave" of H1N1 now scheduled for this fall. A severe "second wave" of H1N1 is possible, in the same sense that it's possible the Blue Jays will win the World Series this year. Science and public policy need to look beyond possibilities and also consider probabilities. Our appreciation of probabilities should be based on evidence, not speculation.</p>
<p>The evidence strongly suggests that a severe "second wave" of H1N1 is very unlikely. It will almost certainly be merely the latest instalment in a growing list of pandemic false alarms.</p>
<p>Let's begin by putting this warning in some context. This is the fourth pandemic alarm in the past six years. The first three have been wrong.</p>
<p>The first alarm was about SARS. At the time, pundits predicted that SARS would become a pandemic and that more than 100 million people would die. Wrong. SARS died out because it was not really very infectious outside of hospitals.</p>
<p>The second alarm was for H5N1 "bird flu." We were told that this disease would leap across the species barrier and cause a devastating human pandemic. More than a billion people were supposed to die in an imminent catastrophe of unprecedented dimensions. Wrong. H5N1 remains a disease of birds that rarely infects people who live in close contact with birds. There is no scientific reason to expect this to change.</p>
<p>The third alarm was for the dreaded "first wave" of H1N1. All of our pandemic planning had been directed toward this "first wave." It was supposed to hit fast and hard. Eight to 12 million Canadians were supposed to fall ill over two to three months. Between 10,000 and 50,000 Canadians were supposed to die. H1N1 may have hit quickly but in public health terms it has not hit hard. Regular seasonal influenza kills 2,000 to 4,000 Canadians every year. H1N1 has killed fewer than 50 people in Canada in its "first wave."</p>
<p>So now we are warned about the H1N1 "second wave." How serious is the risk? There are three general arguments supporting the "second wave" hypothesis. None of them stand up well to scrutiny.</p>
<p>The first argument is historical, based on the 1918 "Spanish Flu" pandemic. In the spring of 1918 there was a relatively mild "first wave" of influenza followed by a much more severe "second wave" in the fall. The problem is that the cause of influenza was a mystery in 1918. The influenza virus itself was not discovered until 1933. There is no reliable basis to conclude that the two 1918 "waves" were caused by the same virus. Based on everything we have learned about influenza in the last 75 years, it is much more likely that the mild 1918 "first wave" was caused by a different influenza virus. This argument is more folklore than science.</p>
<p>The second argument warns that H1N1 could "mutate" and become more virulent. Mutations are extremely common in all viruses, indeed in all living organisms. Important sustainable behavioural changes caused by mutations are, however, very, very rare. Mutations are just the raw material of evolution. Natural selection favours micro-organisms that don't kill their hosts. Evolutionary trends in infectious diseases are consistently in the direction of lower virulence. Our experience with influenza and every other infectious disease supports this. The mutation argument is science-fiction.</p>
<p>The third argument is that H1N1 will be more severe when it hits during our normal flu season - the cold, dry months of winter. This hypothesis is, at least, coherent. It is also testable. Our eyes should be glued on the southern hemisphere where H1N1 is now active during their normal flu season. And the news is good. Australia is now two months into its H1N1 "first wave" and it hasn't been substantially more severe than what we faced. Furthermore, the data now suggest the Australian outbreak is ending. The seasonal hypothesis may be reasonable but the evidence is against it.</p>
<p>Why is H1N1 so mild? I think the reason is becoming increasingly obvious. It relates to the demographics of this outbreak.</p>
<p>Influenza is a benign and short-lived illness in the great majority of people infected. Seasonal influenza is an important public health problem because of the secondary complications of influenza - most typically pneumonia. These complications occur almost exclusively in older people, particularly those with underlying chronic illnesses. Influenza can cause serious illness in young people but this is rare.</p>
<p>Most of the serious illness from H1N1 is in relatively young people. The pundits are presenting this as bad news. It is actually very good news.</p>
<p>The key epidemiological characteristic of H1N1 is that it is not affecting older people. By and large, people over the age of 50 appear to be protected, probably because of exposure to similar H1N1 viruses prior to 1957. This is why H1N1 is such a pandemic dud. The people who should be dying just aren't getting sick. There is no reason to think this is going to change.</p>
<p>The proportion of serious illnesses in young people is high by default. The actual number of these cases in young people is actually very, very small. Is H1N1 more serious in young people than seasonal influenza? Maybe, but even if it is it's not very much more severe. We won't know for sure until we know the actual infection rates in this age group.</p>
<p>So, we should relax and enjoy the summer. H1N1 may well return in the fall but we should expect attack rates to be modest and the incidence of serious illness to be very low. There are lots of good reasons to get Toronto municipal workers back on the job but urgent pandemic planning is not one of them.</p>
<p>I'll end with a challenge to the media. The media love this story and accept the pundits' gloomy predictions uncritically. If this turns out to be the fourth pandemic false alarm in six years, as I think it will, it will be time to start asking some probing questions.</p>

</div><div>Dr . Yoel Abells   </div>

</p>
<p>It seems as though it was only yesterday. What began as a story of isolated cases of a potentially lethal respiratory illness evolved into a full-fledged global epidemic known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). I was out West skiing when I heard of the first case of a Toronto man dying from the illness. By the time I returned to Toronto, more people were hospitalized with the disease and more deaths were occurring. Soon, there was profound confusion as no one seemed prepared for what was happening. Hospitals operated in vacuums, no coordinated community-based approach was in sight, and multiple mixed messages were being sent out from different sources to various stakeholders.</p>
<p>Professionally, these were trying times. Often gowned, gloved and always masked, I found it difficult to interact with my patients because I felt separated from them. For me, the dynamics of patient care in the emergency department, the delivery room and my office changed dramatically. The day-long use of masks made me feel ill and tired. Furthermore, I was politically involved in the events that transpired through my role as chair of Family Physicians Toronto -- a grass-roots group that had been established to address the needs of the community. This was the group that demanded and formulated a response to the community-based needs during SARS.</p>
<p>At a personal level, while I was resigned to the possibility that I might become infected, I was constantly worried about bringing SARS into my household. I was obviously concerned about the health of my family. What was particularly gnawing was the sense that there was no end in sight.</p>
<p>All this is just to give an appropriate context to what follows -- an attempt to provide some balance to the myriad media reports suggesting an impending fall epidemic that is bound to have a catastrophic effect. If nothing else, SARS taught me not to be complacent. In fact, for a period of time after SARS, at different venues, I expressed concern regarding the apparent apathy that seemed to prevail. This was the theme in a presentation given to the SARS Commission.</p>
<p>But, in spite of the dire predictions related to H1N1 influenza, I am much less worried now. This is not to say that I do not have some concerns. I still believe governments and health officials have not given enough thought to certain funding issues and to concerns related to community-based leadership.</p>
<p>However, I am also aware that a lot of effort is being put into developing strategies to address the needs at varying levels should a pandemic strike. A unified template for how hospitals and the multitude of community providers and agencies should respond has been established. Vaccinations are being processed. Leadership is being put in place. The basics of proper infection control are widely disseminated. These are all good things.</p>
<p>The message is clear. Vigilance and awareness are important. To be hygienically careful (and to teach our children) is wise. But to be paralyzed by fear is counterproductive and truly unwarranted. I have no doubt that we are better prepared than we were for SARS. And that's most reassuring.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Listeriosis outbreak result of 'leadership void': Probe</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>357 words</div><div>22 July 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>A "void in leadership" within the federal government during last summer's deadly listeriosis outbreak came after company officials and overworked meat inspectors failed to identify a persistent listeria problem at the <span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span> plant, according to a highly critical report by an independent investigator.</p>
<p>Sheila Weatherill, who released her report Tuesday, zeroed in on a "vacuum in senior leadership" among government officials at the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency that caused "confusion and weak decision-making."</p>
<p>Despite the litany of problems flagged in the report, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz was quick to rule out any government compensation for the families of the 22 victims who died after consuming tainted meat. Maple Leaf has already apologized and agreed to pay up to $27 million to settle lawsuits.</p>
<p>"There are simply no easy answers," Weatherill told reporters before unveiling 57 recommendations aimed at preventing another outbreak.</p>
<p>While conceding listeria is a "virulent bug that is very difficult to pinpoint and even harder to keep in check," the report identifies decisions that "were not thoroughly thought through or executed" at every level, which contributed to the outbreak.</p>
<p>Weatherill also found senior executives at both Maple Leaf and the government agencies were not fully engaged in food safety issues, cementing a lack of urgency in the way they initially addressed the brewing crisis.</p>
<p>At the plant level, the report concludes company staff took action to destroy the bug whenever it was found, but they missed the "big picture" -- which was the "repeated pattern of presence of listeria on the same production lines several weeks after the problem was presumed to have been fixed."</p>
<p>MORE MISTAKES</p>
<p>The CFIA conceded Tuesday that two of its employees, who later developed swine flu, failed to follow safety procedures when investigating an H1N1 outbreak at a central Alberta pig farm this spring.</p>
<p>Officials said it appears the workers took off their protective masks when the equipment fogged up in the hog barn, despite protocols that called for the masks to remain in place throughout the investigation.</p>

</p>
<p>While a wicked lightning storm knocked down trees and power lines in Edmonton over the weekend, the city's pro baseball team was on the road doing the same to the Victoria Seals.</p>
<p>The Seals appeared to be mere bystanders in a Royal Athletic Park home set they felt they needed to win. The Capitals won the four-game series 3-1 by taking the last three games. The capper was Sunday's 11-5 Edmonton victory in which the Seals booted more balls than a soccer team by recording a season-high tying five errors.</p>
<p>This may have been a swing series, one that could prove crucial for the Capitals' hopes of reaching the playoffs in the North Division while making Victoria's prospects all that much dimmer.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we've put ourselves in a bit of a hole," said Victoria field boss Darrell Evans. "But we're hitting the ball. If we pitch better, we're going to win most of our remaining games. We have to win series. If we do that, we will be where we need to be in the standings."</p>
<p>With the Calgary Vipers, 14-1 in the last 15 games and seemingly on another level, the battle for the second playoff berth in the division is taking form between the Caps, Seals and Chico Outlaws.</p>
<p>The second-half champion will meet the first-half champion Vipers in the divisional playoffs in September. If the Vipers (34-14 overall and 8-1 in the second half) also win the second half, which is a distinct possibility, then the second post-season berth will go to the team with the next-best overall record over the entire season.</p>
<p>The Capitals (24-18 overall and 6-4 in the second half) seem positioned at this point to make the North Division playoff round a diamond version of the Battle of Alberta as the games of summer are quickly becoming fewer and more precious.</p>
<p>Victoria is 17-25 overall and 4-6 in the second half while Chico is 20-23 overall and 1-4 in the second half.</p>
<p>Edmonton field manager Brent Bowers said the key word for his team in the Victoria set was "consistency."</p>
<p>"This league is all about hitting. So if you match that with decent pitching, you are going to win," added Bowers, whose club got solid throwing in Victoria.</p>
<p>"Now we will have to keep our consistency when we play Calgary 16 times down the stretch. That's a good team."</p>
<p>The Seals are now in a four-day break before meeting the Toros in Tucson, Ariz., for a three-game set beginning Friday. This is the gap in the schedule in which the Seals were to visit Tijuana to play the Potros. The Mexican club, however, bowed out of the GBL season because of concerns over the swine flu.</p>
<p>"It's a shame because we sure could have used those games to play now and get wins," said Brett Flowers, the best of the Seals in Sunday's loss with four hits, two homers and five RBIs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only thing more lethargic than the Seals' fielding Sunday was the team's absolute lack of timely hitting.</p>
<p>The Seals twice left the bases loaded and stranded a whopping total of 13 runners in a game that had the 1,888 fans sitting in stupefied silence during vast stretches.</p>

</p>
<p>With the H1N1 flu spreading at a rate too rapid to keep count, the chances are good it will be going strong when school resumes in the fall.</p>
<p>And with this particular strain striking a disproportionate number of young people than more conventional influenzas, officials at universities and school boards are gearing up for major awareness campaigns.</p>
<p>"When it comes to large social gathering points, these are prime areas for transmission of disease," said Dr. Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health</p>
<p>The University of Guelph has long had a pandemic plan in place, associate director of communications Lori Bona Hunt said. "We take our lead from public health. It's a co-ordinated regional response, and we take measures that they advise us to do."</p>
<p>The university's pandemic committee held a meeting about H1N1 earlier this month. Information on preventive measures will be sent out via the institution's website and made available at various locations during orientation. Information on H1N1 will be sent to parents.</p>
<p>"We will just really encourage everyone to engage in preventive measures," Bona Hunt said. The university's student health clinic is staffed with doctors and nurses, and is generally the first line of treatment for sick students, she added.</p>
<p>Upper Grand District School Board and Wellington Catholic District School Board are working on H1N1 prevention plans, also in conjunction with public health.</p>
<p>Upper Grand director of education Martha Rogers said officials from the public and Catholic boards are meeting with health officials later this week to share information and solidify plans. "We've been doing pandemic planning for about four years now," said Rogers. "It's maybe not as definitive as it could be, but planning is well underway."</p>
<p>Mercer said the best way to prevent illness is to stay two metres away from anyone who looks ill, wash your hands often or use an alcohol-based hand rub, and cough into your elbow.</p>

<p>Statistics Canada had its crack at reporting the latest inflation rate. Now it's my turn.</p>
<p>Let's see. The price of bus tickets here in Ottawa has just surged to $1.15 from $1, or 15 per cent (this after a three-month bus strike this past winter, but never mind). The monthly cable and Internet bill is up 4.2 per cent from earlier this year. The annual car and home insurance bills, which I paid in the past couple of months, were up 15.8 and 6.9 per cent, respectively, from a year ago. Property taxes, which I finished paying off last month, were up just under 4 per cent from 2008.</p>
<p>Gasoline is about the only thing I can think of that has fallen noticeably and had an impact on our family cash flow. The price for regular gas in Ottawa was about 88 cents a litre yesterday, down from $1.36 a year ago.</p>
<p>Depending on how you read Statscan's inflation report last Friday, the cost of living either fell a little bit in June or rose by a routine amount. Regardless of which view you choose, we're seeing the word deflation – falling prices, in very simple terms – being thrown around a fair bit these days, both here and globally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inflation is far from dead at our house. In fact, I have to wonder as a bill payer if I'm being squeezed to make up for revenue shortfalls caused by the very recession that is supposedly causing a risk of deflation.</p>
<p>The 0.3-per-cent decline in the headline inflation rate in June was notable because it was the first monthly year-over-year drop in 15 years. The biggest contributor to this decline: energy. In fact, if you took energy out of the calculation, inflation actually moved up 2.1 per cent last month.</p>
<p>While the all-in cost of living fell in June, this is not true deflation. For that, we need sustained declines in prices that cause consumers to stop buying things in the hope of being rewarded for their patience with lower costs.</p>
<p>A deflationary period in Japan from the late 1990s to the middle of this decade caused a long period of economic stagnation. From an investment point of view, deflation would be a disaster because it would entail ultralow interest rates coupled with poor stock markets.</p>
<p>With energy prices being the prime driver of lower living costs last month, many economists don't believe we face any risk of true deflation.</p>
<p>“The whole deflation topic has been blown out of proportion in the media,” said Krishen Rangasamy, an economist at CIBC World Markets.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean the matter is settled.</p>
<p>Check out money manager Eric Sprott's July investment commentary (go to Sprott.com and check under Markets at a Glance). He and his colleague David Franklin never actually use the word deflation, but they provide a bleak economic outlook in the United States that could lead to falling prices. Their evidence includes things like declining retail sales and tax revenue and idle industrial production.</p>
<p>“We are now in the early stages of a depression,” they write. “The economic indicators we follow to track real economic activity are all signalling a slowdown of massive proportions.”</p>
<p>Deflation is already threatening in Japan for a second time this decade. If swine flu fares up again when the weather cools down, there's speculation that it could nudge a struggling global economy into deflation.</p>
<p>Still, at ground level where people work, spend and pay bills, signs of deflation are tough to find. CIBC's Mr. Rangasamy sees shelter costs falling some more because of mortgage rates and declines in the cost of natural gas, which is used in home heating. He also mentioned car prices as an example of a product where prices have been falling.</p>
<p>Got the picture? If you're not buying a new car, or if you haven't set up or renewed a mortgage, you're missing out on two major categories of price declines.</p>
<p>It all comes down to energy, then. If you drive a lot, your personal inflation rate may be down. If you don't, then you may be paying more for goods and services at a time when the term deflation is being tossed around.</p>
<p>Let's remember that true deflation is marked by the reluctance of consumers to buy things because they expect better deals ahead. That's the opposite of what's happening in two prominent areas. Far from waiting to buy homes, people are jumping back into the market. New car sales are still down, but the pace of decline has been easing.</p>
<p>Rule out nothing with an economic slump as nasty as the one we're in now. But worry about deflation? At our house, the bills coming in tell us inflation's the bigger problem.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>On the home front</p>
<p>Five flavours of inflation</p>
<p>Statistics Canada reported last week that the cost of living in June fell 0.3 per cent from a year earlier, the first such monthly decline in 15 years. Yet inflation is far from dead, if you judge by these recent cost increases at the home of Globe personal finance columnist Rob Carrick:</p>
<p>Expense</p>
<p>Expense Cost increase (%)</p>
<p>Property taxes 3.9</p>
<p>Monthly cable TV and Internet 4.2</p>
<p>Annual home insurance 6.9</p>
<p>Bus tickets 15</p>
<p>Annual car insurance 15.8</p>

<p>Vaccine experimentation under way for swine flu</p>
<p>A flurry of innovative vaccine trials is in the offing as governments and regulatory agencies prepare for the probable launch of mass swine flu vaccination programs in the fall.</p>
<p>In Canada, plans are under way to try to test whether people with egg allergies can be given flu shots containing vaccine produced in eggs.</p>
<p>Currently, that is considered unsafe and is not done.</p>
<p>Canada's entire supply will be egg-based vaccine.</p>
<p>Lightning may strike indoors, as well</p>
<p>Experts say don't assume you're safe from lightning just because you're indoors.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Weather Service says, on average, about 50 people are killed by lightning in the U.S. each year.</p>
<p>Dr. Mary Ann Cooper, of the lightning injury research program at the University of Illinois, says, once inside, don't use landline phones, wired computers or video games.</p>
<p>Cooper says there are increasing numbers of people injured by lightning indoors because they are using PlayStations and other hard-wired video games.</p>
<p>Depression creates more risky pregnancies</p>
<p>Postpartum depression is being recognized and treated these days, but less well-known is depression during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It's a common problem, as well, and one that also can be risky for the unborn baby.</p>
<p>Researchers in the United States found in their study of 791 pregnant women that 44 per cent had depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>They tracked the women through delivery and found that those with depressive symptoms had nearly twice the risk of delivering a baby early, before 37 weeks.</p>
<p>The researchers say early delivery is associated with health risks, with premature delivery being the top cause of infant mortality.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Mass health-worker absenteeism feared; Doctors and nurses' aversion to flu shots endangers plan to vaccinate them first so they are able to treat others</b>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER, VICTORIA and EDMONTON -- Hospital workers are supposed to be first in line for any pandemic influenza vaccine so they can keep Canadian hospitals running during an outbreak – but that strategy hinges on workers agreeing to take an unproven vaccine for an uncertain threat.</p>
<p>Across Canada, somewhere between 40 and 60 per cent of health-care workers opt for a flu shot each season, despite extensive efforts to persuade the entire work force to get immunized. In a normal flu season, that's not a major problem.</p>
<p>But in a serious outbreak of H1N1, the unwillingness of large numbers of doctors, nurses, paramedics and others could lead to soaring absenteeism rates, draining the health-care system of workers just as they are needed most. Faced with lesser risks, Canadian health officials have tried to make flu shots mandatory, but those efforts have typically failed, with the rights of the individual trumping any broader societal concern.</p>
<p>That may leave the state of Canada's health-care system dependent on voluntary efforts that have so far proven unable to spur health-care workers to get flu shots.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, British Columbia's chief medical officer, said that at least eight in 10 workers should be getting immunized – nearly double the current rates in many parts of the country, including his own province.</p>
<p>Unless health-care workers overcome their reluctance toward flu shots, he said, a serious outbreak of H1N1 would lead to soaring absenteeism rates, as doctors, nurses and others are forced home to sick beds. Dr. Kendall said he was at a loss to explain why there is such reluctance to get vaccinated. “I don't understand why people would be resistant to getting flu shots, particularly health-care workers.”</p>
<p>However, any move by government to make inoculations mandatory is likely to be a non-starter, Dr. Kendall said, because it would encounter resistance from health-care workers and a possible legal challenge under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. “It will be an extraordinarily contentious thing.”</p>
<p>Unions for health-care workers have strenuously resisted efforts to make flu shots mandatory, and, in interviews, several unions and employee organizations said they would be prepared to go to court to battle such an order. “If it's made law, there may be legal challenges to that,” said Glen Gilles of the Ontario Paramedic Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilles said a decision on a legal challenge would depend, in part, on the severity of the swine-flu threat, and how well the vaccine works in warding off illness. He noted that the Ontario government is able to require paramedics and others to take inoculations against other, more serious diseases.</p>
<p>Right now, it's not possible to gauge the extent of the threat, or the effectiveness of the vaccine. Adding to the uncertainty is the possibility that the vaccine administered to the first wave of people this fall may go only through initial clinical trials. Canadian medical officials are promising stepped-up monitoring of the vaccine's effects in that case.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, paramedics went to court to oppose the Ontario government plan to make flu shots mandatory, arguing the move violated their Charter rights. Ontario backed down, so the case was withdrawn. But in 2001, an Ontario labour arbitrator sided with health-care employees fighting mandatory flu shots, saying the hospital policy violated employees' constitutional right to “life, liberty and security of the person.”</p>
<p>Ontario Nurses' Association president Linda Haslam-Stroud said her union would object to any attempt to make vaccines mandatory for the province's registered nurses.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Coastal Health authority said it requires that all staff be immunized, regardless of whether they have direct patient contact. In practice, the best it can do is threaten to send workers home without pay if they are assigned to work where there is a flu outbreak and they refuse to be immunized. It rarely comes to that – most are reassigned to another work area for the duration of an outbreak.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan, typically fewer than half of nurses get a flu shot, a number that even their union president calls “surprisingly low.”</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Union of Nurses president Rosalee Longmoore said her organization allows each member to decide whether to be immunized, and she expects the H1N1 vaccination to be no different. “We certainly encourage employees to obtain the vaccine, but we also respect the individual's right to choose.”</p>
<p>The numbers are even lower in Nova Scotia, where just 30 to 40 per cent of nurses receive the flu shot, according to the Nova Scotia Nurses' Union, with president Janet Hazelton adding that the number is slowly climbing each year as availability increases. Over all, about half of the province's health-care workers receive annual immunizations, the province's Health Ministry said.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Business leaders are expecting a bad bout of flu this fall, says the Conference Board of Canada's latest report on pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>And the underlying message of the report is that companies need to start readying now for the H1N1 virus strain to get worse.</p>
<p>The Ottawa-based group says business leaders expect the virus to spread more quickly and be more virulent than it has so far.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 virus is behaving differently than organizations expected. Even though the summer months are not usually hospitable to the influenza virus, H1N1 continues to spread quickly," Trefor Munn-Venn, the board's director of national security and public safety, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Hope is not an option for organizations - they should begin responding now.</p>
<p>"Those organizations that don't already have a plan need to recognize just how serious the pandemic is expected to be and start preparing both their staff and their businesses."</p>
<p>Getting top management behind pandemic preparedness plans so resources can be quickly allocated is also seen as a key priority for companies.</p>
<p>The report comes out of a meeting convened last month by the Conference Board.</p>

<p>The following editorial appeared recently in the Ottawa Citizen</p>
<p>While the H1N1 flu continues its steady march around the world, hitting particularly hard in the southern hemisphere now experiencing peak flu season, Canada is getting off relatively lightly this summer. Which provides an opportunity for Canada to become a world leader in pandemic preparation before the next wave hits, as it is expected to this fall.</p>
<p>There are already promising signs that Canada will, in some ways, be well prepared for the new challenges the H1N1 virus will likely bring.</p>
<p>Because of a prescient agreement between drug company <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> and the federal government, signed in 2001, Canadians will have a better chance of getting flu vaccines than people in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>The agreement obliges the company to provide flu vaccine to every Canadian who wants it, in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>The only glitch is how quickly the vaccines can be produced, which means health officials will have to make some tough decisions about who should get vaccinated first. That strategy should be communicated clearly ahead of time so that Canadians understand who is most at risk and why it is important they get vaccinated first.</p>
<p>In Eastern Ontario, emergency planners are doing the right thing by taking stock now of equipment such as life-saving ventilators ahead of a new wave of flu.</p>
<p>Although health officials believe there are enough ventilators, it is crucial a well-communicated plan is in place for how to share them among hospitals.</p>
<p>Canada has a little breathing room this summer. In the face of difficult issues such as how to reduce the flu's deadly impact in remote northern communities, that time must be put to good use.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Strike thwarts kitty's final resting spot; Demise of beloved feline sets family searching for rules and regulations governing backyard burial</b>
</div><div>Catherine Mulroney   </div>
<div>Special to the Star</div>
<div>943 words</div><div>21 July 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>It may not be the biggest issue of the strike that has Toronto in a stranglehold, but it sure has been the most important one for our family.</p>
<p>Familiar with the results of the dispute between CUPE and the city - the mounting garbage, families without daycare, the emptied pools and docked ferries - all we needed was a simple, if somewhat unique, question answered by someone at city hall.</p>
<p>How deep do you have to go to bury a pet in your backyard?</p>
<p>After the eldest of our three cats died last week, my husband called our vet to find out how to deal with the remains. I was thrilled when he reported backyard burial was an option.</p>
<p>I hadn't even considered the idea, assuming it would be against city bylaws. Immediately seized with the notion that a corner of our garden would be forever Snickers, I began planning. But when my husband the gravedigger asked for specifics, we realized we needed guidance.</p>
<p>That is where we ran into trouble. Who could tell us, mid-strike, what we needed to know?</p>
<p>Normally, I would call the city for something like this. In my distressed state, however, I figured attempting to get that kind of information out of a city hall wrestling with much bigger problems was a waste of my grieving time.</p>
<p>I picked up the phone to call the vet back, but a sob escaped my lips, so my daughter gently took the receiver out of my hand and placed the call herself.</p>
<p>"We just have to make sure she's six feet under," Molly informed me. Although it was one of my all-time favourite television shows, I greeted the cited measurement with skepticism. We may be on a first-name basis with the neighbourhood raccoons, but not even their nightly scavenging would require that degree of protection.</p>
<p>Besides, we don't own a backhoe, and in a house where no one cracks 5-foot-7, it was clearly not going to happen, especially for a cat who only weighed about 9 pounds and measured less than 2 feet from nose to the tip of her bushy tail, fully extended.</p>
<p>And so I decided to do some more digging.</p>
<p>We may be living in the information age, but I was soon reminded that some questions actually take a human to answer.</p>
<p>A trip to the City of Toronto website offered me requisite strike- related information about garbage and the city's offer. It also taught me that Toronto is home to six opera companies and something called the Bicycle Friendly Business Awards. I'm feeling pretty reassured about swine flu. But not a shred of information that I could find relating to my cat's final resting place.</p>
<p>Molly picked up the phone again, this time to call the Toronto Humane Society. Calmly, she explained that the family cat had died and that we were looking for burial information.</p>
<p>"Well, she sure wasn't very nice," Molly reported after she hung up. "She wasn't very compassionate. When I asked what to do, she said, 'I dunno" and then told me to call the city. Hasn't she heard there's a strike?"</p>
<p>Time was increasingly of the essence, and everyone awaited my decision. I suddenly recalled a conversation with a mother whose son's hamster died mid-winter. The child insisted on a proper burial, but with the ground frozen solid, his mother had no choice but to park the deceased behind the ice cream and frozen peas until spring thaw.</p>
<p>Determined to protect my brand-new bottom mount freezer, I resolved to find an answer quickly. A call to the city's 24-hour Access Toronto hotline offered a pleasant recording informing all those who hadn't noticed that the city is experiencing a labour disruption and a suggestion to call back after business hours when volume might be lower. Since I called at 6 a.m., I began to give up. Hell might be freezing over, but the cat sure wasn't. We needed to act.</p>
<p>I toyed with the notion of cremation, wondering whether the property tax rebate I hope we get would cover the costs.</p>
<p>I also wondered about the nature of other unique queries Torontonians might have that are going unanswered during the strike.</p>
<p>We finally found our answer, courtesy of a Hamilton law firm's website. Apparently, the Dead Animal Disposal Act stipulates an animal be buried at least 2 feet deep.</p>
<p>Family members took turns digging a hole we all agreed was deep enough to do right by the cat, the neighbours and any bylaws we might not know about.</p>
<p>Snickers was laid to rest at the back of the garden, under a tree a friend had planted a few years earlier.</p>
<p>A peaceful spot, far removed from the labour unrest that grips the city.</p>
<p>We would have loved to keep her there. But Sunday, after a lingering sense of unease, many phone calls, web searches and the like, an emergency city animal control number was able to tell us it was not okay. And so it was back to the shovel, and back to the vet's.</p>
<p>Anyone - labour or management - who wants to help us refill the hole in the backyard, please bring your own shovel.</p>

<p>A year ago, hospitals were satisfied if their suppliers could answer the question: Do you have a pandemic preparedness plan? Yes or No?</p>
<p>Today, those same hospitals want to go over the plan with a fine-toothed comb, says Jeff Stevens, who runs a family-owned medical supplies distribution business in Brampton.</p>
<p>The hospitals want reassurance the Stevens Company would be able to continue to supply them with bandages and sterilizers and defibrillators even if 30 per cent of the warehouse staff booked off sick with H1N1, for example.</p>
<p>"We started seeing about a year ago some requests, primarily from hospitals, whenever there was a public tender being put out, one of the requirements was to have a pandemic plan," he said. "At first they were asking do you have one? Yes or no.</p>
<p>"Now they're asking to see a copy of it because a lot of companies, all they've done is taken something off the Internet, photocopied it and said, 'This is my plan.' That won't be adequate.</p>
<p>"You need to have a plan that's an active plan that you can modify, change and get to employees quickly," said Stevens, the fifth generation of his family to run the Brampton distribution firm.</p>
<p>Amid reports of H1N1 virus outbreaks at summer camps and the prospect things could get worse this fall, more companies are being warned they need to prepare for a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>The Conference Board of Canada issued a report yesterday urging organizations of all kinds to act while they still have time.</p>
<p>Based on a gathering of leading pandemic experts held in June, the private, non-profit group came up with a 36-page report called "Ready Or Not: Effective Pandemic Response." It outlines three key criteria for staying in business during an outbreak: communicate effectively with employees, suppliers, governments and media; devote time and resources to developing a plan; and share valuable lessons with peers.</p>
<p>"From all the disasters we've looked at over time, it's the people who are unprepared, who panic or overreact," said Trefor Munn-Venn, the conference board's director of national security and public safety.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many Canadian organizations lack a pandemic plan. Estimates range widely.</p>
<p>A survey by Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters found 87 per cent of 575 companies surveyed did not have a pandemic plan in place. The study was conducted in the last week of April and early May.</p>
<p>Manufacturers and exporters have been "on a wild roller coaster ride" in recent years and are more focused on meeting payroll than contingency plans for a possible health crisis, spokesperson Jeff Brownlee explained.</p>
<p>"But we are encouraging members to take the necessary steps, even in the recession," he said, adding few businesses could withstand a pandemic-type shock even when economic conditions are good.</p>
<p>Successful planning goes well beyond ensuring your employees wash their hands properly, Brownlee added. "It's imperative to have a strategy from the boardroom to the shop floor that safeguards all operations of your business, including your supply chain."</p>
<p>The Stevens Company says its pandemic plan outlines everything from who would step in to a critical role if that person fell ill to who can work from home and who would coordinate the plan during an outbreak.</p>
<p>Pandemic 101, a company that sells pandemic planning kits as well as consulting services, says the cost can range from as little as $1,000 for a firm with less than 50 employees to more than $15,000 for firms with more than 250 people. "We're so busy right now, it's unbelievable," said president David Howell.</p>
<p>Buying a pandemic plan is like buying insurance - you may not need it, but can you afford to be without it, Howell asks. Depending on what industry you're in, you could lose customers quickly and never regain them, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>With the strike by Toronto's municipal workers entering its fifth week, negotiations to settle the dispute seem oddly lethargic.</p>
<p>Today, the work stoppage has the dubious distinction of matching a 30-day strike by the old City of Toronto garbage collectors in 1972. Only one local garbage dispute has lasted longer in recent history: a gruelling 38-day strike by Etobicoke's trash collectors in 1984. And that record might well fall next week, given the glacial rate of progress at the bargaining table.</p>
<p>It is important that both sides in the dispute bring a greater sense of urgency and energy to their negotiations. After all, they have every incentive to end this strike because virtually everyone is being hurt by it.</p>
<p>The 30,000 members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, now walking a picket line, have so far lost about 8 per cent of their pay for this year. Given the current hard times and resulting pressures on the city's budget, they are unlikely to win wage increases that will come close to covering what they have already sacrificed. And their financial hole deepens with every day that the strike drags on.</p>
<p>The politicians stand to lose, too - not financially, as they are still being paid, but in plunging approval numbers. The public is rightly outraged by councillors' hypocritical decision to give themselves a 2.42 per cent pay increase while demanding restraint from the city's employees. There is also a pervasive sense that the handling of this dispute has been bungled by those in charge. Mayor David Miller, in particular, was diminished even before Maclean's magazine depicted him crammed into a garbage can on its most recent cover.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Toronto residents are caught in the middle of this dispute in multiple ways. Mounds of garbage foul neighbourhood parks; daycare spaces are closed; children are denied access to swimming pools and city-run summer camps; public health worries mount over the lack of preparedness for the H1N1 virus; businesses can't get essential permits; the tourism sector is being hammered; the reliability of ambulance service has been called into question; and thousands of young people are losing out on summer jobs.</p>
<p>For everyone's sake - young or old, rich or poor, labour or management - a new focus is needed on ending this strike. It isn't enough to note that "talks are continuing." They've done so since the beginning of the walkout, and for months before that. What's needed now is a healthy dose of goodwill and fresh determination from all sides. Then bargaining might speedily produce an acceptable settlement.</p>

<p>When 30,000 Toronto city workers enter Week 5 of a municipal strike, one can expect at least some of the following:</p>
<p>Unemployed residents can't access relief through the welfare system because social services workers are walking the picket lines instead of processing applications for welfare payments.</p>
<p>The head of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, unencumbered by the politics of managing public opinion, says more Torontonians will die from swine flu because 1,800 health department workers are on strike.</p>
<p>National newsmagazine Maclean's publishes a cover story with the mayor propped in a garbage can, banana peel on head, and the headline "Toronto Stinks."</p>
<p>The bad press goes international as CNN shows the world a Toronto mayor disconnected from the reality of the public relations and tourism disaster that attracted the television station.</p>
<p>Tempers are tested as garbage piles up, the stench fills the air and rats multiply.</p>
<p>A citizen dies while waiting for an ambulance and there's speculation that a slowed response time brought on by the strike contributed to the delay.</p>
<p>Toronto has seen all of the above, entering Day 30, with no end in sight. So, what now?</p>
<p>The city can survive more of the same, but not indefinitely. Soon, city and provincial officials will be seeking an exit strategy to return the city to normal. And they'll wake up to the argument that the strike is bad for our health.</p>
<p>Apparently, we're not there yet.</p>
<p>At the first sign of economic distress - a day or two into a transit strike, for example - the province is quick to act and legislate the strikers back to work. Commerce cannot be allowed to grind to a halt. But early health warnings and signs of potential loss of human life don't rate similar quick action. For that to happen, we probably need evidence of bodies piled up because of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>It's not that provincial politicians are derelict. In fact, they accurately reflect our priorities.</p>
<p>The Star's headline on Saturday probably underplayed the seriousness of the matter. Flu expert Dr. Allison McGeer isn't saying that if the strike drags on further, people will be at greater risk from H1NI. She's saying even if the strike ended today, the death toll will be higher than it should have been.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is, more people will die," says the Mount Sinai microbiologist. While city officials tried to downplay the threat, she stood firm in an interview with the Star's Theresa Boyle.</p>
<p>"We are already in trouble. Now we've got 26 days (make that 30) of work that hasn't been done" in planning for the flu outbreak expected this fall, McGeer said.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses and public health workers are on the picket line instead of scrupulously planning for the spread and severity of the virus, following up on leads and organizing vaccination clinics and flu centres city-wide.</p>
<p>While we focus on the garbage piled up in arenas, parks and parking lots, the real human toll of the strike goes unheeded.</p>
<p>Ambulance service has been cut back 25 per cent - that's the extent of the legal strike action they can take. Why emergency personnel are among the striking workers is beyond comprehension. They should have essential service classification, just like police and fire.</p>
<p>By fall, with the health effects of the strike more apparent, we might be wondering why we so devalued the work of the city's 1,800 public health staff.</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty may soon face questions on when he'll legislate the strikers back to work. Answers likely rest with the health workers.</p>

<p>School closings threaten health care, JOURNAL says</p>
<p>Closing schools at the first sign of a new pandemic might delay the worst so health officials can prepare, but cannot prevent the spread of the disease, British researchers said yesterday.</p>
<p>And while closing schools might spread out demands on hospitals, it could disrupt health-care services and the rest of the economy by keeping parents – including health workers – away from work, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London and colleagues said.</p>
<p>Writing in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases, they said governments need to come up with plans for when and how to close schools if the pandemic worsens.</p>
<p>U.S. regulator approves</p>
<p>seasonal flu vaccine</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the ordinary seasonal flu vaccine yesterday and said Americans should plan to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Vaccines against seasonal flu usually become available in September or October, and flu experts say it is worthwhile to be immunized as late as January, because the U.S. influenza season usually peaks in February.</p>
<p>This year will be different – the new H1N1 virus has circulated all summer and companies are working to make a separate vaccine against the strain.</p>
<p>China quarantines</p>
<p>178 foreigners</p>
<p>China's efforts to contain the virus continued with the quarantine of at least 178 foreign students and teachers in Beijing yesterday, with 10 hospitalized after testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>“We can confirm that a group of 107 British schoolchildren and teachers from various schools in the U.K. are being held in quarantine,” the British embassy in Beijing said in a statement.</p>
<p>At least 71 American students also were under quarantine at the same Beijing hotel, said Nicholas Phillips, a teacher from Oregon.</p>
<p>China has responded aggressively to swine flu with temperature checks for arriving international passengers. There have been around 1,500 positive cases of the virus there, although no deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>Russia urges citizens</p>
<p>to seek vaccination</p>
<p>Russian health officials warn that the virus now affects all parts of Europe's largest country and urged citizens to seek vaccination. Public health chief Gennady Onishchenko said the government had registered “a sharp increase” in cases.</p>
<p>EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said in Lisbon that the EU's executive arm would help members of the 27-nation bloc that do not yet have vaccine stock.</p>
<p>Britain to get first batch</p>
<p>of vaccines in August</p>
<p>Britain will get its first batch of vaccines for pandemic H1N1 influenza in August, with enough to vaccinate half the population by 2010, its Health Minister said yesterday.</p>
<p>However, the vaccines would have to go through the appropriate tests before being used, Health Secretary Andy Burnham said.</p>
<p>Britain is the worst-hit country in Europe, with estimates of 55,000 new cases of the virus in the week ending July 12.</p>
<p>Mr. Burnham told Parliament the Health Department has signed two contracts with manufacturers to supply enough vaccines for the whole population. Deliveries are to begin in August, with enough becoming available for at least 30 million people by the end of the year, he said.</p>
<p>England's chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, said that in a worst-case scenario, about a third of Britain's population could be infected and 65,000 killed. Mr. Burnham said these were “worst-case scenarios, not predictions.”</p>

<p>As many as 633 First Nations chiefs will help chart a new course for aboriginal politics in Canada as they meet in Calgary this week to elect their next national leader.</p>
<p>Five candidates -- Shawn Atleo, John Beaucage, Perry Bellegarde, Terry Nelson and Bill Wilson -- are vying for the top role at the Assembly of First Nations.</p>
<p>The race heated up when current National Chief Phil Fontaine, first elected 11 years ago, announced he wouldn't seek a fourth term. The longtime leader was a "wheeler-dealer," experts say, a master statesman whose crowning achievement was last year's residential schools apology from the Canadian government.</p>
<p>The changing of the guard, though, is significant, say election watchers.</p>
<p>"We're at a complete state of change," said indigenous politics expert Kiera Ladner, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Economic growth, treaty rights and the push for sovereignty have emerged as key issues, she said. But as Native leaders brace for more swine flu, particularly among remote rural reserves already hard hit by H1N1, health could easily become the most immediate issue to try the new leader, said Ladner.</p>
<p>And in the long term, the next national chief will have to set a tone for federal relations, she added.</p>
<p>But he will also have to figure out how to smooth relations between various First Nations bands, said Treaty 7 Grand Chief Charles Weaselhead in an interview.</p>
<p>"First Nations are developing their own portfolios, improving on their governance, accountability and transparency," said Weaselhead. "We need some strong leadership from our national chief that's going to emphasize building a collective unity nationally for First Nations chiefs," he said.</p>
<p>"I think that itself is quite a task."</p>
<p>The election comes as chiefs across the country are pressing for a patchwork of national treaty implementation. Many are calling on Canada to adopt the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>The federal government, meanwhile, has begun introducing a new agenda that includes rewarding First Nations bands that show strong economic portfolios.</p>
<p>Federal leaders, too, are watching the election. The national assembly is the major aboriginal advocacy group in Canada. While the chief's political power is limited, he is instrumental in moderating the climate of complex government negotiations.</p>

</p>
<p>Britain, hard hit by the swine flu outbreak, has told citizens to scrap their holiday if any family member show flu symptoms and has warned pregnant women to avoid public transit and large gatherings.</p>
<p>At the height of the summer vacation season, Britain's Health Department is warning those with the virus not to travel, and airlines and cruise companies have begun to screen passengers and are refusing to accept those who show signs of the illness.</p>
<p>With the number of cases continuing to rise, Home Secretary Alan Johnson warned the crisis was a bigger threat to Britain than terrorism. He said that although the H1N1 virus was developing much faster in Britain than expected -- indeed much faster than most other countries -- the government was prepared.</p>
<p>So far, more than 650 people have been hospitalized with the virus in England, including more than 200 children. Under-fives have been three times more likely than older patients to be taken to hospital. Pregnant women are also more likely to develop serious symptoms than other adults.</p>
<p>Expectant mothers are being urged to avoid unnecessary journeys and crowds, with the suggestion that they do not travel on trains and the <span class="companylink">London Underground</span> at peak crowded times.</p>
<p>Parents are advised to keep babies away from crowds, while pregnant women are encouraged to limit the movements of their children, so they do not bring the disease home.</p>
<p>Experts believe that most cases of swine flu would not harm the mother or fetus, but rare cases could lead to premature labour or miscarriage or cause birth defects.</p>
<p>In Australia, where 11 expectant women with swine flu are in intensive care, pregnant women have been urged to stay at home when possible, and to wear face masks when they do go out.</p>
<p>Mask-wearing is not part of Britain's strategy since it is thought to do little to reduce the spread of disease and encourages complacency about more useful measures, such as regular hand-washing.</p>
<p>Economists warn the high number of sick days could delay hopes of an economic recovery until after 2010. Ernst & Young said if the flu outbreak hits the government's worst case scenario, with includes a projected 65,000 deaths this winter, it could knock another three per cent off economic output, leaving the economy facing its worst decline since 1921.</p>

<p>Toronto businesses are not prepared and are "struggling to keep ahead" when it comes to planning for a global H1N1 pandemic, warns the head of a Toronto-based non-profit that focuses on urban health.</p>
<p>"Many organizations have not done proper risk management to prepare for the inevitability of people being away from work," said Rick Blickstead, CEO of the Wellesley Institute. "There are some really large business and social issues that people have not put pen to paper in terms of developing plans."</p>
<p>Companies need to figure out how to set up systems so that ill employees can work from home, develop policies that deal with large numbers of paid (or unpaid) sick days and create opportunities for childcare, said Blickstead, who spent 25 years in the private sector doing organization revitalization for companies such as Rona, <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and the City of Toronto before joining the Wellesley Institute.</p>
<p>He says companies have been preoccupied by the recession and have neglected to focus on their own, in-house pandemic plans while relying on public health officials to take the lead.</p>
<p>If companies don't have a pandemic plan, "they should get one very quickly," said Carol Wilding, president and CEO of the Toronto Board of Trade.</p>
<p>But she noted that Toronto businesses seem better prepared for a pandemic because of the SARS outbreak in 2005.</p>
<p>The civic workers' strike hasn't helped.</p>
<p>"You've got people in public health looking at garbage sites, determining whether they're going to spray them as opposed to being able to do the jobs they're actually so well-trained to do," Blickstead said, noting his comments are based on anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>Last week, the head of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital warned that the city will see more deaths from an H1N1 pandemic because the strike has prevented weeks of work from being done.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is that more people will die," said microbiologist Dr. Allison McGeer.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning requires that officials consider all scenarios.</p>
<p>And while the best hope is that the H1N1 virus will continue to cause mostly mild illness, though infect many more, the worst fear is that it could follow the same course as the 1918 Spanish flu, which hit with a mild form in the spring, but returned with a vengeance in the fall.</p>
<p>It infected one-third of the world and contributed to the deaths of more than 50 million people.</p>
<p>September is the big question mark. That's the earliest the second wave could hit. So public health officials and infection control experts have been changing summer vacation plans and are hunkering down in preparation for the fall. (Toronto is an anomaly because of the civic workers' strike. Pandemic planning is continuing, but at a reduced capacity.)</p>
<p>The problem is no one knows what to expect.</p>
<p>There's a possibility that a mutated version of H1N1 could take hold, one that is more virulent and resistant to anti-viral drugs. Anti-viral resistant cases have already been seen in Denmark, Japan and Hong Kong, but they have not been strong enough to spread.</p>
<p>Combine all that with word earlier this month from the World Health Organization that the virus is spreading faster than any other pandemic in history and that a vaccine may not be ready until the end of the year, and there is even more reason to be on guard.</p>
<p>September is also of concern because that's when students return to school, notes Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention for the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. It's not surprising the rate of new infections in the province dropped when school let out and that outbreaks occurred when students went to summer camp, he says.</p>
<p>But pandemics are unpredictable as this one is already showing itself to be. The rate of infection over the summer has been much higher than expected, given influenza viruses tend to die down in hot and humid weather. And unlike seasonal flu, this bug is affecting younger people.</p>
<p>All of the uncertainty surrounding the virus has created major challenges for health officials. The old axiom of hope for the best but prepare for the worst couldn't be more fitting.</p>
<p>"We have a very heightened state of awareness for H1N1 illness in the province and in the country right now," says Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The province's 600-plus-page pandemic plan, which is based on a massive outbreak of influenza that causes moderate illness, is constantly being revisited and revised, she says.</p>
<p>For example, health officials are looking to see what lessons can be learned from the outbreaks in Manitoba First Nations communities where the virus spread quickly because of poor living conditions. That experience showed that hospital intensive care units are poorly equipped for an influx of patients with the virus.</p>
<p>Indeed, Canadian hospitals, in general, have little "surge capacity" to deal with such outbreaks, so officials are preparing contingency plans that would see elective surgeries postponed and medical care moved out to the community.</p>

<p>When President Barack Obama picked Sonia Sotomayor for the U.S. Supreme Court, he suggested the judge's modest beginnings and bootstrap background would add immediacy and even empathy to her opinions. But neither legal smarts nor life lessons seemed foremost on Judge Sotomayor's mind when she reflected on her accomplishments. Her perspective on her trajectory? “I am always looking over my shoulder wondering if I measure up.”</p>
<p>“Daunting” and “humbling” is how she described her nomination, while her first words at the podium were about being nervous. In her assessment, she is less like the supremely self-confident Mr. Obama, with whom she has often been compared, and more like many successful professional women whose obvious bona fides don't stop them from doubting themselves – even in public.</p>
<p>Social psychologists have known for decades that a large group of female high-achievers don't really believe they're as smart and accomplished as others think they are. Though they excel in public, they secretly feel like they're pretending. Dubbed the imposter phenomenon, many of these highly accomplished women privately attribute their achievements to chance events, and each time they move up a rung, they wonder when their luck will run out.</p>
<p>Take Margaret Chan, who, as head of the World Health Organization, is the world's most powerful public health official. Her policy directives contained outbreaks of avian flu in 1997 and SARS in 2003 and, more recently, she has been tackling H1N1. Yet, when asked by a New York Times reporter how she rose to her position, the superbly qualified Dr. Chan said it was all a matter of luck: She just happened to be at the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Such disconnects between self-perception and reality don't cancel out these women's achievements. Nor do they make them any less deserving of their appointments. In fact, having less bluster can have the opposite effect, spurring those with less self-confidence to outstrip the competition by trying much harder.</p>
<p>When two Dublin cognitive scientists, Michelle Cowley and Ruth Byrne, looked at what distinguishes chess masters from mediocre players, they discovered that the most brilliant players constantly second-guess themselves. They look eight moves ahead and anticipate the worst. Novices, meanwhile, were more likely to be optimistic – and then experience crushing defeats. It turns out the experts are not bursting with self-confidence. They are self-doubters who hone their skills by countering their own hypotheses.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone doubts their abilities now and then, but evidence shows university-educated women are much better at it than men. According to research by two Purdue psychologists, Shamala Kumar and Carolyn Jagacinski, women are more likely than men to agree with the phrase, “I can give the impression that I am more competent than I really am.”</p>
<p>Still, doubting yourself doesn't mean you're unequal to the task. The women who had the highest scores on the researchers' imposter scale were also eager to test themselves – to prove to themselves what everyone else already knew. This is how they bested their peers. And they were unlike the men in the comparison group, who, if they felt unsure of themselves, wouldn't enter contests they thought they might not win. “The motivation of the men was to avoid doing poorly, looking weak,” Dr. Jagacinski said.</p>
<p>While Judge Sotomayor has played down her controversial “wise Latina” remarks made in a 2001 speech, she was right about one thing: Gender does make a difference in our judgments, especially our self-judgments. But, ultimately, it's not whether you think you're good that counts. It's whether you really are good.</p>
<p>Susan Pinker, a psychologist, is the author of The Sexual Paradox: Extreme Men, Gifted Women and the Real Gender Gap.</p>

<div>THE INTERVIEW / SWINE FLU / DAVID BUTLER-JONES, HEAD OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY OF CANADA</div>

<p>David Butler-Jones knows what you are wondering.</p>
<p>“It's a common question,” says the doctor who lives with the H1N1 flu pandemic breathing down his neck.</p>
<p>But, yes, he sleeps well at night.</p>
<p>“I don't generally lie awake worrying about it,” explains the head of the Public Health Agency of Canada on the phone from Winnipeg, where he is based. “Periodically I will wake up in the night and have an idea that I write down to make sure I don't forget it in the morning about something else that we need to do, and then I go back to sleep.”</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones, a 55-year epidemiologist and public-health expert, is under the microscope as the country girds for an expected resurgence of the H1N1 flu virus in the fall. But he is accustomed to the demands of a 26-year career in public health that has seen him deal with a variety of crises, from water contamination in North Battleford, Sask., in 2001, during his tenure as chief medical officer for the province, to the listeria outbreak across the country last year in his capacity as the first chief public-health officer at the agency, formed in 2004, in the wake of SARS.</p>
<p>His cure for the pressure? “One of the things that keeps me sane is every couple of days I try to go for a long swim. It clears my head and it keeps me in shape.” He swims laps, up to three kilometres, at the local YMCA in both Winnipeg and Ottawa, where he travels every week for meetings. “The Y has been wonderful,” he says with a light laugh. “They gave me a card and a locker in both places.”</p>
<p>His exercise regime, which has ramped up along with H1N1 pandemic fears, has resulted in significant weight loss. “I've lost 30 pounds, and about 20 of that since this started in April. I've been trying to lose weight, but this has really helped,” he jokes.</p>
<p>His work also requires that he relax quickly, when the opportunity arises. “One of the secrets of the job is to take half an hour to get grounded, to relax quickly. Fatigue and the adrenalin are a very dangerous combination.”</p>
<p>Since the early spring, when swine flu was identified, he has had few uninterrupted weekends. The length of his working hours varies, as he is kept abreast of developments, internationally and in Canada, such as the outbreaks in several Ontario summer camps last week. “It often feels like I go from breakfast meetings to dinner meetings to bed.” Although outbreaks are dealt with by local medical officers, and the provincial health system, when required, Dr. Butler-Jones and his team are constantly monitoring the H1N1 illnesses across the country to keep an eye on the virus's possible mutations. “We are the ones who say, ‘Okay, this is more than a local event, it's something bigger.' ”</p>
<p>Planning for a pandemic, what he calls the country's “surge preparedness,” has been a focus of the agency since its inception, even though its responsibilities for public health are broad, including diabetes and obesity issues, among others. “We had an ongoing focus to get preparations in place, building surveillance systems and connections within the provinces and territories and developing relationships internationally, such that when Mexico first saw this [virus], their first reaction was to call us to ask, ‘What do you think and can you give us some help?' ” Samples of the virus were flown to Winnipeg, and the agency dispatched epidemiologists and laboratory technicians to help the Mexicans build their surveillance network. That preparedness also includes a contract with <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to produce enough vaccines for the Canadian population.</p>
<p>“When I look back at this, I am glad for the preparations we have done. I'm concerned about what we do between now and the fall, and how we keep building for the preparedness. There will always be surprises. And we won't get everything right. [But] Canada was the first country to have a pandemic plan for the health system nationally. … And while there's always more we could do, we're probably in a better position than anybody else in the world right now.”</p>
<p>He doesn't mind being under scrutiny. “Nobody would wish that there be a pandemic, no matter how inevitable it is, but if it's going to happen, this is where all our training and preparation will pay off or not, and if it is to happen, I would rather be in the middle of it than not.”</p>
<p>Still, he knows that the H1N1 virus will be the most serious issue he has encountered in his career. Like many viruses, H1N1 is unpredictable and can confound the best-laid plans.</p>
<p>A recent worrisome development has been the severe illness and in some cases, death, of otherwise healthy young adults with no underlying health conditions, he acknowledges. “That's a characteristic that we don't usually see very much at all in annual flu or in the pandemics, say, of the fifties and sixties, but it was a characteristic of 1918. And even though in 1918, it was a minority of total cases, it was what gave rise to the stories of young people dying – the perfectly healthy farmer who's out in the field one day and dead the next.”</p>
<p>Still, only about 2 per cent of the people who got sick in the 1918 pandemic of Spanish flu died, he says, and many were related to underlying risk conditions and secondary pneumonias. Now, there are antibiotics to fight secondary infections and ventilators to assist people who are having trouble breathing, he points out.</p>
<p>Asked what part of the country's preparedness he is most concerned about, Dr. Butler-Jones points to the actions of individuals. “The key thing will be what we will all do at the end of day. These diseases spread because of what we do or don't do,” he explains, listing the common advice to wash hands, sneeze or cough into one's sleeve and avoid others when symptoms appear. “It sounds so simple but … all of those things can have a huge impact in reducing how quickly this moves and give us more time to actually get a vaccine in place and spread out the disease, so that hospitals are better able to cope. If you can slow down the spread, then you don't have five or six or seven admissions a day in the ICU. That becomes pretty difficult to manage.”</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones, a father of three adult children whose 34-year marriage recently ended in divorce, accepts that public-health officers always carry a huge burden.</p>
<p>“It's not like a surgeon, who may be killing them one at a time. The way I've approached it is knowing that every decision or no decision has a consequence. … You just keep doing it, and you ache for people. There's a huge emotional part of it when you know the decisions you are making have a huge impact for good and bad.”</p>
<p>He also accepts that his reputation could be a casualty of the swine flu. “If, at the end of the day, I get pilloried for [the handling of] it or whatever, that's just the nature of the business. … One thing with being a medical officer is you are born with a big bull's eye.”</p>

</p>
<p>The longest total solar eclipse of the 21st century, visible Wednesday, has sparked tourist fever in eastern China, which experts say is the best place to view the event.</p>
<p>The total eclipse, expected to last about six minutes, will pass from southwest China across the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing to Shanghai and Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, according to NASA's eclipse website.</p>
<p>Tourist agencies, park managers and hotels have been overwhelmed by worldwide enthusiasm for the spectacle, which comes as the domestic tourism market is experiencing a slowdown because of the financial crisis and the swine flu.</p>
<p>"July is traditionally low season for overseas travellers, but we saw a surprising burst of numbers," said Zhi Chenyan, a deputy manager at the China Travel Service in Zhejiang. "My counterparts in other cities have been disappointed about sales for months ... but all of a sudden we are all having a boom with the eclipse."</p>
<p>His team has handled about 600 tourists from the United States and Europe since July, an unprecedented number for the travel agency in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Chen Shiming, spokesman for Shanghai Sculpture Park, one of the most highly recommended viewing locations in the city, said the park sold more than 2,000 tickets for the eclipse.</p>
<p>"We received lots of calls from Japan, United States and European countries," Chen said.</p>
<p>The park is offering a pair of special glasses to view the eclipse and a T-shirt with an eclipse logo for each person purchasing a $22 ticket, he said.</p>
<p>A solar eclipse occurs when the moon is caught between the sun and the Earth while each of them moves along their fixed orbits.</p>
<p>The next total solar eclipse will be on July 11, 2010, but far fewer people are likely to see it as it tracks across the South Pacific over French Polynesia and Easter Island to the southern tip of South America.</p>

</p>
<p>While public-health officials are putting out calm messages about the global H1N1 flu pandemic -- that summer camps are safe, that most illness has been mild -- behind the scenes they are preparing for the worst.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning requires that officialdom consider all scenarios.</p>
<p>And while the best hope is that the H1N1 virus will continue to cause mostly mild illness, though infect many more, the worst fear is that it could follow the same course as the 1918 Spanish Flu, which hit with a mild form in the spring, but returned with a vengeance in the fall. It infected one-third of the world and contributed to the deaths of more than 50 million people.</p>
<p>Combine all that with word from the World Health Organization last week that the virus is spreading faster than any other pandemic in history and that a vaccine may not be ready until the end of the year, and there is even more reason to be on guard.</p>
<p>September is the big question mark for public-health officials. That's the earliest the second wave could hit. So public-health officials and infection control experts are hunkering down in preparation for the fall.</p>
<p>The problem is no one knows what to expect. Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, uses the example of a hurricane: "There are some pandemics where disease is mild, the equivalent of a hurricane that never quite makes it to force 5, blows itself off the Atlantic Ocean and never bothers anybody. And there are some pandemics, like in 1918, that are like hurricane Katrina and do a huge amount of damage."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Native leaders head to Calgary to elect new national chief; High-profile Chief Fontaine declines bid for fourth term</b>
</div><div>Jamie Komarnicki   </div>
<div>For the Calgary Herald</div>
<div>1150 words</div><div>20 July 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A s many as 633 First Nations chiefs will help chart a new course for aboriginal politics in Canada as they meet in Calgary this week to elect their next national leader.</p>
<p>Five candidates -- Shawn Atleo, John Beaucage, Perry Bellegarde, Terrance Nelson and Bill Wilson--are vying for the top role at the Assembly of First Nations.</p>
<p>The race heated up when current National Chief Phil Fontaine, first elected 11 years ago, announced he wouldn't seek a fourth term. The longtime leader -- a familiar face in both native and non-aboriginal circles-- was a "wheeler-dealer," experts say, a master statesman whose crowning achievement was last year's residential schools apology from the Canadian government.</p>
<p>For many Canadians, the high-profile Fontaine has essentially defined the national body for years.</p>
<p>Wednesday's election, then, will introduce to the nation a new leader who, although basically unknown outside of particular aboriginal and political circles, will be responsible for renewing the vision of the national assembly.</p>
<p>Non-aboriginal audiences may have picked up little of the nationwide campaign. Some natives are closely tuned in, but news travels slowly, especially in remote communities.</p>
<p>The changing of the guard, though, is significant, say election watchers.</p>
<p>"We're at a complete state of change," said indigenous politics expert Kiera Ladner.</p>
<p>Economic growth, treaty rights and the push for sovereignty have emerged as key issues, she said. But, as native leaders brace for flu season, particularly among remote rural reserves already hard hit by H1N1, health could easily become the most immediate issue to try the new leader, said Ladner, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>In the long term, the next national chief will have to set a tone for federal relations, she added.</p>
<p>But he will also have to figure out how to smooth relations between various First Nations bands, Treaty 7 Grand Chief Charles Weaselhead said in an interview.</p>
<p>"First Nations are developing their own portfolios, improving on their governance, accountability and transparency," said Weaselhead.</p>
<p>"We need some strong leadership from our national chief that's going to emphasize building a collective unity nationally for First Nations chiefs," he said.</p>
<p>"I think that itself is quite a task." Indeed, the election comes as chiefs across the country are pressing for a patchwork of national treaty implementation. Many are calling on Canada to adopt the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>The federal government, meanwhile, has begun introducing a new agenda that includes rewarding First Nations bands that show strong economic portfolios.</p>
<p>All this, as the nation's aboriginals struggle with decades-old social issues--crumbling housing, poor drinking water and health conditions, high rates of crime and suicide --along with a burgeoning youthful population that far outpaces the national rate of growth.</p>
<p>Federal leaders, too, are watching the election. The national assembly is the major aboriginal advocacy group in Canada. The chief's political power is limited. However, the national leader is instrumental in moderating the climate of complex government negotiations.</p>
<p>Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl says the national role is a "huge political task" that means having one ear tuned into national affairs, and the other close to the ground for rumblings from Canada's reserves.</p>
<p>It's a gymnastic feat he knows well.</p>
<p>"That's always a balancing act for me, to respect the jurisdiction of an individual First Nation and not expect that the AFN is going to plow all its ground for us," Strahl said in an interview. "It's a huge political task for whoever wins this. They've got to have great political skills, they've got to be well-organized, and I think they have to be able to communicate a solid vision of where they want First Nations to go."</p>
<p>If the federal government has a significant agenda, then the new aboriginal leader, too, must step up with a matching show of strength --combined with consensus-building among the bands, said Ladner.</p>
<p>"The AFN has to really craft its own agenda and not just respond to the federal government," said Ladner.</p>
<p>Each of the five national chief candidates insists he would be the best voice of the people.</p>
<p>Last-minute candidate Wilson, from British Columbia, has a long resume that includes negotiating with national and provincial leaders on the Constitution in the early 1980s. His decades of experience, he said, show he has "proven experience as a warrior.</p>
<p>"I've been proven in battle, I've got the scars emotionally and physically to prove it," he said.</p>
<p>Forging economic partnerships is a key part of his platform.</p>
<p>Beaucage also has a strong economic background. Building partnerships is at the top of his agenda, he said. "There are five of us running, certainly nobody is going to take the election on the first ballot," he said.</p>
<p>"I think the most important thing will be to forge the alliances," he said.</p>
<p>The task isn't a simple one. Unrest is bubbling, particularly among youths who feel "there's nothing to lose," said Beaucage.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of impatience." Dark horse candidate Nelson said the structure of the national assembly itself is in question. "The fact the AFN is so dependent on the federal government concerns me," he said.</p>
<p>"The reality is that every chief that's going to attend that conference has faced funerals in their home communities. Young people are paying for the price of inaction."</p>
<p>Indeed, intergenerational issues are at the forefront of this campaign.</p>
<p>Perceived front-runner Atleo is seen as a candidate who can bridge the age gap.</p>
<p>Social progress on reserves, Atleo said, goes hand-in-hand with economic development. "(The chiefs) want their people to be working so they can respond to the myriad of social issues--gang violence, drugs, infrastructure needs," he said.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan's Bellegarde, meanwhile, said Canada's First Nations people need to start making partnerships with industry and government.</p>
<p>"Closing the socio-economic gap between First Nations people and the rest of Canadians, basically, addressing poverty -- that's a big issue," he said.</p>
<p>Regardless of who is elected, he will find himself in a role where persuasion-- not political power--is the main tool.</p>
<p>The new leader will immediately face a number of challenges, said Sakej Henderson, research director with the Native Law Centre of Canada.</p>
<p>"You're a form of opposition without any seats. You have to do everything by persuasion," he said. "Which isn't bad, but it only goes so far."</p>

<p>SIX NATIONS</p>
<p>Six Nations has confirmed a mild case of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>It is believed to be the first case in the community.</p>
<p>Six Nations said community officials talked to parents at the Stoneridge Day Care about the diagnosis last Thursday, but would not say if that is where the patient was from. There is no word on whether the case was a child or adult. Elected Chief William Montour has called on the community to keep calm and become educated about how to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.</p>
<p>"Acts of aggression against unfortunate community members, who have contracted this influenza at no fault of their own, cannot be tolerated," Montour said in a press release.</p>
<p>Six Nations said Ohsweken Public Health and Six Nations Health Services are getting ready for mass vaccinations when the vaccine is available. That could be in late fall.</p>
<p>Health services has also created an H1N1 booklet that will be delivered to homes in the community Friday.</p>
<p>Booklets will also be available during the Grand River Pow Wow. Meanwhile, handwashing will be promoted in Chiefswood Park.</p>
<p>The booklet can also be picked up at the Six Nations administration building as of Friday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Losing the mind game a major league problem; Stress is putting more and more players on the DL</b>
</div><div>John Jeansonne   </div>
<div>Newsday</div>
<div>844 words</div><div>20 July 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>In 18 years as the Mets' team psychiatrist, Dr. Allan Lans witnessed player insecurities, depressions and griefs "all the time." But this recent wave of major-leaguers becoming so stressed that they have been assigned to the disabled list has moved Lans, now a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, to call social anxiety disorder "the swine flu of baseball; it's crazy."</p>
<p>Before the all-star break, three players--one of them on two different occasions--officially had been put on the DL by the anxiety diagnosis. Just as Kansas City pitcher Zack Greinke was sidelined three years ago, Detroit pitcher Dontrelle Willis, St. Louis shortstop Khalil Greene and Cincinnati first baseman Joey Votto have missed playing time this season for non-physical issues.</p>
<p>Greene made a second trip to the DL on June 30 after falling into another unsettling batting slump.</p>
<p>Experts remind that debilitating strains of performing in the world of elite competitive sports hardly are new. Local baseball historians recall some paralyzing doubts, after their first taste of the big</p>
<p>leagues, expressed by no less than Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle a half-century ago.</p>
<p>But it hardly is clear whether anxiety disorder is spreading, is more widely reported, or is possibly over-diagnosed lately.</p>
<p>"Many, many athletes I see are suffering from anxiety and it's always been there," said Dr. Tom Ferraro, a Nassau County, Long Island-based sports psychologist who has worked with athletes and celebrities for more than 20 years. "The pressure, being on stage and under scrutiny, this is not easy. To get a baseball player or a general manager to put a high-level athlete on the disabled list, rest assured, it's not a mild tension."</p>
<p>Lans agreed that "anxiety disorders are very real," and cautioned --as did Ferraro--that cases must be judged individually and with thorough knowledge of the player's personal history. There are multiple sources for feeling sad and low--from Votto citing his father's death last August to Greene's admission of "internalizing" poor performance--but Lans noted that "feeling depressed is not depression" and that, in many situations involving young ballplayers, "they're suffering from adolescence, and that's not an illness."</p>
<p>Anxiety, after all, "is normally part of any performance," Lans said --the oft-mentioned "butterflies." "It's a regulatory thing, like getting up in front of the class and giving a talk. You need a certain edge to perform at your highest level, the thing you see with pitchers--like bullfighters-- going though a ritual. You learn to control it and, once you start performing, it goes away."</p>
<p>Furthermore, baseball players build up a sort of immunity--as they advance from school teams to minor leagues to the big time--to the growing crowds and media and competition. "To suddenly develop anxiety disorders (in the majors), it's an unlikely setting for that to evolve," Lans said.</p>
<p>Ferraro argued there "are many issues related to depression in athletes. Physical injuries create major depression, or personal loss. It's an abnormal environment. They're traded, they're benched, or, like Chuck Knoblauch, they can't throw."</p>
<p>Lans and Ferraro agreed that a relationship of trust with a trained psychiatrist or psychologist is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. And that anti-anxiety drugs are, at best, a last resort.</p>
<p>"A professional psychologist does one thing and one thing only," Ferraro said, "and that is give them time to talk. Listen. On a regular basis. Let them ventilate."</p>
<p>To Lans, putting a player on the disabled list "makes no sense at all. In the general public, when you see a very depressed person, you don't put him in the hospital; that makes it worse, because then he'll think he's crazy. At all costs, the guy should be kept at work.</p>
<p>"Baseball is a wonderful thing because, when the game starts, the only thing in the world is the game itself. It's a treatment. Why do any of us go to games?Turn off the cellphone and everything else goes away."</p>
<p>When Mays, 1-for-his-first-26 major league at bats, despondently asked manager Leo Durocher, "Mr. Leo, send me back (to the minors)," Durocher told Mays not to worry, that he would be the New York Giants' centre-fielder as long as Durocher was manager, and the healing began.</p>
<p>In a game in which dealing with failure is paramount, Lans said, there must be that understanding that "kids need something more than at-bats."</p>

<p>Ask Canadians what most embarrasses them and many would likely say the condition of our First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Yet the subject rarely gets national attention until there's a crisis, such as the unsafe drinking water that forced the evacuation of Kashechewan in 2005 or the more recent epidemic of H1N1 flu that swept across reserves in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Our short attention span underscores the challenge facing the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) as it meets in Calgary this week to choose a new national chief. For if the AFN's new leadership is to help Canada's native people out of the morass, it needs a willing partner in Ottawa and the provinces.</p>
<p>Earlier this decade, there were efforts to move in that direction, culminating in the 2005 Kelowna Accord - a $5 billion agreement among Ottawa, the provinces and native groups to raise aboriginals' standard of living to the level of other Canadians by 2016. But Prime Minister Stephen Harper killed the deal when he took office in 2006.</p>
<p>Three years later, the story is depressingly familiar: There are still 42 First Nations without schools and 100 communities that must boil their drinking water.</p>
<p>For the past 12 years, the public face of the AFN has been Phil Fontaine, who negotiated the ill-fated Kelowna Accord with the former Liberal government and led the campaign for a full public apology for mistreatment of students in residential schools. Now, as the AFN prepares for the post-Fontaine era, it needs to build on his efforts to deliver improved education, decent housing and a fair share of resource revenues to First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Without such a foundation, economic development will remain out of reach, and First Nations people will be condemned to continued poverty and alienation.</p>
<p>The two leading candidates to replace Fontaine - Shawn Atleo and John Beaucage - are experienced regional figures. Atleo, the AFN's B.C. regional chief, is stressing economic development and skills training as a way up for communities that have been down for too long. Beaucage, grand council chief of the Anishinabek Nation in Ontario, seeks to streamline the AFN's unwieldy structure by reducing its more than 600 bands to a more manageable grouping of 60 traditional nations. And he wants all status Indians to have a vote for the national chief, rather than restricting the ballot to band chiefs.</p>
<p>Both candidates are focusing on native youth, and with good reason: Young people now make up 50 per cent of the native population and are the fastest growing segment of the Canadian population.</p>
<p>The AFN estimates Canada loses $12 billion in productivity annually because of native joblessness. Yet there are also success stories, like the 30,000 aboriginal students in university and the 20,000 businesses owned and managed by aboriginals.</p>
<p>Whoever emerges this week as the new national chief, the federal and provincial governments must engage with him and join together in a drive to improve the First Nations' standard of living.</p>

</p>
<p>The U.S. position in the country of origin labelling (COOL) trade dispute is full of irony. It's almost funny, in a dark way. But COOL is hurting our livestock producers and our economy, and that's no laughing matter.</p>
<p>America's law on COOL governs meat that is processed in the U.S. but made from foreign livestock. When an American slaughterhouse buys hogs from Ontario to make pork chops, the package labels for those chops must indicate that the animals came from Canada.</p>
<p>But American meat packers don't want the work of tracking which animals end up in which packages. So they are reducing their purchases of Canadian animals instead. Exports of Canadian cattle to the U.S. are 29 per cent lower so far this year compared to last, while hog exports have dropped 39 per cent. Prices are down, too.</p>
<p>That's hurting Canadian farmers, as hog producers reminded us this month when they protested at Queen's Park and in Niagara-on-the-Lake. It is not just our manufacturers who are suffering from "Buy American" policies.</p>
<p>COOL is also hurting our depressed economy. Livestock exports to the U.S. were worth $2.2 billion in 2008, but could be $1 billion smaller in 2009.</p>
<p>It isn't that our southern neighbours distrust "Canadian" food. Exports to the U.S. of beef and pork meat, rather than live animals, are about the same this year as last. Their consumers seem content to eat the meat. But their processors don't want to package it.</p>
<p>COOL aims to give U.S. consumers the "right to know" where their food comes from. The implication is that shoppers can avoid food illnesses by identifying "risky" foreign sources.</p>
<p>Ironically, it's American sources that have been risky. The U.S. has had three national food recalls in less than a month. Cookie dough from Virginia, beef from Colorado, and milk powder from Minnesota were pulled off U.S. shelves.</p>
<p>Those are on top of earlier recalls of California pistachios and Georgia peanuts. COOL clearly didn't prevent those problems from reaching American consumers.</p>
<p>Most of those recalls also reached us in Canada. That's another irony: We seem to need protection from American food more than they do from ours.</p>
<p>Where food labels could assist with problems is after the fact, by making recalls easier and faster. But COOL doesn't provide enough detail to help there either. The law only requires identification of the country, not the county or the farm.</p>
<p>Consider the peanut recall that began last January. Products were still being added to the recall list in June, five months later.</p>
<p>Even the U.S. Department of Agriculture recognizes that COOL is not about safety. Its Food Safety and Inspection Service doesn't run that program. Instead, COOL falls under the Agricultural Marketing Service.</p>
<p>The final irony is that this dispute exists at all, given that Canada and the U.S. cooperate so much in agriculture. We worked with the Americans to promote overseas pork exports after the swine flu outbreak. More recently, the two countries agreed to recognize each others' organic food standards. And yet this dispute persists.</p>
<p>Back in May, Ottawa requested consultations with Washington on COOL's trade impact. Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, this gave them 60 days to negotiate an agreement. That deadline expired on July 6, so Canada is now free to take the issue to a WTO dispute panel.</p>
<p>That's exactly what Trade Minister Stockwell Day and Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz announced last week in a different dispute: Korea's ban on Canadian beef. And the potential gains there are less than a tenth of what COOL is costing us.</p>
<p>So Mr. Day and Mr. Ritz, I'm sorry to interrupt your summer break. But since the American government hasn't changed its policy, you need to act.</p>

<div>SWINE FLU / DEBRIEFING THE KIDS</div>

</p>
<p>With recent headlines about swine flu spreading to summer camps, mothers like Maria Stanley are starting to worry. A lot.</p>
<p>“Even the name swine flu kind of terrifies me,” says the 35-year-old mother of two from Kingston. “I can't even measure how concerned I am about it.”</p>
<p>Lately, Ms. Stanley has been taking extra precautions to alleviate her concerns, such as staying vigilant about hand-washing and steering her family away from public places. But despite her anxiety, she's careful not to let her kids catch whiff of her fears.</p>
<p>“There's no need to frighten a five-year-old,” she says. “You tell them as much as you need to and then it's my job to worry.”</p>
<p>To health officials and parenting experts, Ms. Stanley is taking the right approach by shielding her young children from her concerns, which she admits could be overblown.</p>
<p>It's important that parents project confidence and calm to their kids, regardless of how they may be feeling, says Deb DeJong, a parenting consultant in Kitchener, Ont.</p>
<p>“As adults and parents, we need to stay informed but be aware of how much anxiety we're putting on this …,” she says. “They'll be more anxious … we can make it worse.”</p>
<p>For kids who are old enough to read the newspaper, parents should try to explain H1N1, says Susan Coombs, a pediatrician in Toronto.</p>
<p>“That would be very worthwhile,” she says. “Otherwise children will wonder what's happening.”</p>
<p>But striking that balance between educating your kids and scaring them half to death is tricky, she says.</p>
<p>“Try and prepare them for things, so they're not surprised,” she advises.</p>
<p>For kids who are frightened by reports of swine flu-related deaths, parents should stress that these cases are rare and health officials are working very hard at containing the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>“You just need to talk about it, to say it's not something that should stop you at this time from going to school or going to an activity,” she says. “At the present time, the illness that we're seeing is not vastly more frightening than things we see quite regularly.”</p>
<p>But with younger kids, there's no point in explaining H1N1 when your child can't even spell the term, says Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention for the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>“Having a conversation with a kid below the age of 8 about this, you're not going to get very far,” he says. “I think giving it a specific name really isn't necessary.”</p>
<p>The important thing for concerned parents is to emphasize the importance of clean hands and proper sneezing etiquette – not as preventative measures for swine flu per se, but as precautions against all infections, says Colin Lee, associate medical officer of health for Ontario's Simcoe-Muskoka region and co-author of The Flu Pandemic and You: A Canadian Guide.</p>
<p>“I think [parents] just need to concentrate on the measures … and not necessarily bring extra attention [to swine flu],” Dr. Lee advises. “It's difficult for [young children] to understand what this really all means.”</p>
<p>If they do start asking questions about swine flu, parents should definitely have a conversation with them, Dr. Lee says.</p>
<p>For Ms. DeJong, the key is to tread carefully and avoid launching into a full-on, encyclopedic explanation.</p>
<p>“Ask them, ‘What do you think it is?' ” she says. “Get an idea of how much they know or don't know. Then you can deal with some basic definitions.”</p>
<p>From there, it's best to discuss swine flu in terms your kids can relate to, she says. Use an even, measured tone of voice and explain that H1N1 is an infectious disease many people are getting; however, little boys and girls can stay safer by washing their hands with soap for the same amount of time it takes to sing the happy birthday song.</p>
<p>“You want them to feel empowered with knowledge versus scared,” Ms. DeJong says.</p>

<p>The plans of thousands of British holidaymakers are in jeopardy after they were warned yesterday not to travel if they showed symptoms of swine flu.</p>
<p>The Department of Health is urging those with the virus not to travel, while airlines and cruise companies are refusing to accept passengers who show signs of the illness.</p>
<p>With the number of cases continuing to rise, Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the crisis was a bigger threat to Britain than terrorism.</p>
<p>He said that although the H1N1 virus was developing differently to what had been expected, the government was prepared.</p>
<p>"We have been preparing for this for a long time," he said. "It actually came above terrorism as a threat to this country so we have gone through simulation exercises where everyone was involved."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">British Airways</span> and Virgin became the first carriers to monitor passengers at check-in and turn them away if they appeared to have flu.</p>
<p>A BA spokesman said there had been a "very small number of cases" where people displaying symptoms had been advised not to travel.</p>
<p>"Our staff are trained on what to look out for if someone has swine flu or any other communicable disease," he said.</p>
<p>"The staff seek medical advice and anyone with swine flu would be advised they are unfit to travel. Even if they disagree with us, we have the power to stop them going on board."</p>
<p>A spokesman for <span class="companylink">Virgin Atlantic</span> said sufferers who were turned away would not be allowed on board without a "fit- to-fly" certificate from their doctor or a hospital. It had not reported any cases.</p>
<p>P&O Cruises said customers were being given a questionnaire and would be assessed by medical staff prior to boarding if they were a suspected sufferer. Anyone deemed unfit to travel would be turned away. Anyone whose symptoms developed while on board would be placed in quarantine.</p>
<p>Shearings Holidays said bus travellers were being asked not to travel if they felt unwell. It has placed antibacterial hand solution at its pickup and drop-off points to help prevent the spread of infection.</p>
<p>The Association of British Insurers said that travelling against official advice would often nullify any policy and insurers would not pay out in the event of illness while abroad.</p>
<p>Fears continue to grow abroad over the high levels of swine flu in Britain.</p>
<p>Passengers arriving at airports yesterday wore masks and a boys' football team from Esher, Surrey, has been banned from a tournament in South Korea because of their hosts' fears that they might bring swine flu with them, even though none had the virus.</p>

<p>The British government has drawn up contingency plans to cope with an escalating swine-flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Proposals are designed to reduce human contact and to deal with a major rise in the number of deaths.</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<p>- The Crown Prosecution Service will take fewer offenders to court. The CPS would, instead, issue more fines and cautions for minor crimes such as theft and drugs offences, and some crimes involving violence, rather than take the offender through the courts and risk spreading the illness there.</p>
<p>- Banning crowds from major sporting events. The Football Association and Premier League are understood to have drawn up plans with the Department of Health under the Civil Contingency Act to ban crowds at matches. It could spread to sports events such as the</p>
<p>Ashes cricket series.</p>
<p>- Setting up emergency mortuaries. A 59-page document raises the prospect of using shipping containers and inflatable storage facilities as emergency mortuaries.</p>
<p>It suggests planners consult with crematorium staff to see whether it is practical to move to 24-hour, seven-days-a-week operations.</p>
<p>- Ensuring businesses are ready. The government has produced a range of documents to help businesses deal with the pandemic in the event they lose a lot of staff to the illness. Among the suggestions is a hit squad of workers trained to undertake a variety of key tasks.</p>
<p>- Longer sickness leave. Anyone infected with swine flu can stay off work for 14 days without a doctor's note.</p>

<p>H1N1 influenza and West Nile virus are grabbing headlines but people shouldn't forget that AIDS is still taking its toll, said organizers behind Saturday's AIDS Awareness Day.</p>
<p>"You will never forget (AIDS) as long as I live. We are losing a lot of people," said Aynalen Ali, the founder of Connecting Communities Coalition, which ran the event.</p>
<p>There was a carnival-like atmosphere on Edmonton Street in front of Knox United Church, with live music and Winnipeg's African community setting up booths to sell crafts and ethnic foods. The African Central Market sets up in the area every Saturday in summer.</p>
<p>"It's a celebration. We don't want people to feel bad," said Ali.</p>
<p>The coalition handed out T-shirts saying "Protect Yourself, Protect our Community" and "I've been tested," for people tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p>
<p>Soft drinks and hotdogs were also given out to the estimated 300 people who attended.</p>
<p>"Three or four years ago, you would never get people out for something about AIDS" because of the stigma, said Arlene Elliott, coalition member.</p>
<p>But more and more women in North America are getting the disease, following trends in developing countries.</p>
<p>"You're seeing heterosexual transmissions," Elliott said.</p>
<p>Both Elliott and Ali have seen people die of AIDS. "Once you've seen the face of AIDS, it spurs you to action," Elliott said.</p>
<p>People with AIDS today can live 20 to 30 years so long as they take medication and look after themselves, Ali said.</p>

<p>There is something about the calculated and assassin-like demeanor Lou Pote brings to the mound. Playing six seasons in the major leagues, and earning a World Series ring will give you that sort of confidence.</p>
<p>The Victoria Seals figured to have their work cut out for them against the Edmonton Capitals' starting pitcher Pote, who came into last night's game at Royal Athletic Park with a Golden Baseball League-leading 1.86 ERA. That's darn impressive in a hitters' league.</p>
<p>Pote (6-1) went 5 2/3 innings and struck out 10 in taking the win. But it</p>
<p>wasn't exactly a vintage outing for the only man who has played for all three recent Edmonton pro baseball teams -- the Triple-A Trappers and independent Cracker-Cats and Capitals. Pote allowed nine hits and eight runs as the Capitals won another typical GBL scorefest 13-8 before 2,386 fans.</p>
<p>The Capitals (25-18 overall and 5-4 in the second half) close out their four-game set against the Seals (17-25 overall and 4-5 in the second half) with a matinée today at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The Seals get four days rest after today's game before meeting the Toros in Tucson, Ariz., for a three-game set beginning Friday. The Seals were to visit Tijuana to play the Potros, but the Mexican club bowed out of the GBL season because of swine flu concerns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it was the stiff wind blowing last night at RAP that bedeviled the Seals in perhaps the key moment of the contest. With the bases loaded and two out in the fourth inning, Edmonton batter Jorge Cortes hit a full-count pitch from Victoria starter Chris Bodishbaugh that looked well foul and out of play. But the wind caught the ball and hooked it into fair territory, where it landed a few feet inside the line in shallow left field as three scrambling Victoria players looked on in disbelief. The bizarre, bloop double cleared the bases to give the Capitals a 7-4 lead.</p>
<p>Chad Ehrnsberger, with his seventh RBI in two games, launched a two-run homer in the top of the second inning to give Edmonton a 2-0 lead. Home runs by Josh Arhart and Wilver Perez in the second and third innings, respectively, keyed Victoria to a 4-2 lead.</p>
<p>Newly signed Edmonton DH Walter Young, who played 14 games for the Baltimore Orioles in 2005, is the most physically imposing player the Seals have faced this season at six-foot-five and 290 pounds.</p>
<p>Young blasted the ball more than 400 feet over centre field to make it 4-3 in the fourth inning. An RBI single by Matt Ceriani, who played for Italy in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, tied it 4-4. It was after that the winds of fate may have changed the course of the night.</p>
<p>The Capitals extended their lead to 10-4 before Victoria closed the gap to 10-8 with four runs in the bottom of the sixth inning but were unable to quell the 15-hit Edmonton onslaught.</p>

</p>
<p>The first decade of this new century is one that airlines will be eager to forget.</p>
<p>It has been marked by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the SARS outbreak, skyrocketing fuel costs, the bankruptcy of five major North American airlines and the outright disappearance of the likes of Swissair, Canada 3000 and Jetsgo.</p>
<p>Yet it seems those setbacks weren't punishment enough for an industry hard-pressed to turn consistent profits even in the best of times.</p>
<p>Which these obviously aren't.</p>
<p>Last week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), trade group for the world's major carriers, reversed an earlier prediction that the latest plunge in demand had bottomed out. Reacting to a further 9.2 per cent drop in May traffic, IATA now forecasts total industry losses of $9 billion (U.S.) this year on a likely 15 per cent decline in revenues.</p>
<p>To which Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways PLC, shakes his head and says, "Too optimistic." BA, which posted a record loss of $615 million (U.S.) last year, is so determined to cut 4,000 positions from its workforce that it's prepared to take its first strike in a dozen years.</p>
<p>BA's survival is at stake, claims Walsh. For Calin Rovinescu, CEO of Air Canada since the ouster of his predecessor in April, at stake is averting a second trip through bankruptcy court this decade. Like its peers among large, so-called "legacy" carriers, Air Canada has cut capacity by abandoning routes and reducing frequency of flights.</p>
<p>But Air Canada, which lost more than $1 billion (Canadian) last year, finds that it cannot reduce capacity fast enough to keep pace with sharp declines in traffic. In the past year, Air Canada has cut capacity by 7.6 per cent. But in that time, passenger volume fell 9.1 per cent. Archrival WestJet Airlines Ltd. trimmed its available seats 2.5 per cent during that period. But demand has fallen 7.1 per cent.</p>
<p>The worst global recession since the Great Depression and the accompanying credit crisis have severely reduced volume in all price categories.</p>
<p>Penny-pinching corporate clients have been grounding their employees, using teleconferencing wherever possible. The leisure market has also taken a hit as blue- and white-collar unemployment soars across North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Even workers who remain employed are sufficiently fearful of job loss they're opting for "staycations" rather than flying to Disney World or Vegas.</p>
<p>Fuel costs have dropped this year, of course, but they remain far above 2006-07 levels. Even swine flu and a recent string of airline tragedies have given travellers more reason not to fly. (So far this year, there have been about 630 plane-crash fatalities, more than in all of 2008, though well short of the 1972 record of 2,374.)</p>
<p>BA chair Martin Broughton, who calls the past 12 months an "annus horribilis" for BA and other global carriers, says his industry is "crying out for consolidation."</p>
<p>And it's true that despite all the capacity reductions, there still are too many planes chasing too few passengers.</p>
<p>BA is doing its part with drawn-out negotiations to merge with Spanish flag carrier Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA, and BA hopes later this year to add American Airlines in an alliance among the three carriers.</p>
<p>Deutsche Lufthansa AG, having absorbed the short-lived successor to the failed Swissair, is close to a deal to buy Austrian Airlines.</p>
<p>Air France-KLM Group continues its long flirtation with a chronically profit-challenged Alitalia SpA. Yet even after last year's combination of Delta Air Lines Inc. and Northwest Airlines Inc., the U.S. market remains over-served by six national carriers, along with scores of regional players and upstart discounters such as JetBlue Airways Corp. and AirTran Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>With its heavy debt load and fractious labour relations, United Airlines Inc. seems the likeliest candidate to sacrifice its independence.</p>
<p>Yet even if the industry's consolidation wishes are fulfilled, commercial aviation will still suffer the curse that economists refer to as "low barriers to entry."</p>
<p>Starting an airline is notoriously easy: You just rent or lease one of the hundreds of aircraft mothballed in the Mojave and you're in business.</p>
<p>No sooner do failed carriers such as Jetsgo make their last trip to the hangar than appear the likes of privately held Porter Airlines, based at Toronto's Island airport. Porter goes head to head with Air Canada on the busy Toronto-New York run. (Porter flies to Newark, N.J., one of the Big Apple's three major airports.) Just three years after its launch, Porter counts eight destinations, with a business plan calling for an eventual 17 ports of call.</p>
<p>And U.S. upstart JetAmerica, with a leased Boeing 737, will next month begin offering $9 (U.S.) flights from its Toledo base to Newark, and will also commence service to the sub-metropoli of Melbourne, Fla., Lansing, Mich., and South Bend, Ind. The Jet</p>
<p>America plan is to profit from a raft of "convenience fees" for checked baggage, ordering tickets by phone ($20 U.S.) or Internet ($10 U.S.) and round-trip assigned seats ($20 U.S.).</p>
<p>Upstarts are the curse of the industry, driving down fares enough on cash-cow routes to impoverish larger carriers that rightly fear losing market share if they don't match the lowest fare on offer. Trouble is, these legacy carriers are operators of high-cost networks, vying for passengers with low-cost startups.</p>
<p>It's not as though the established players can be credited with unerring discipline.</p>
<p>Calgary-based WestJet last week unveiled expansion plans for 11 new destinations in the U.S. and Caribbean for next winter. Air Canada, which Bay Street expects will lose money this year and next, making for three consecutive years of red ink, plans to add capacity on major routes in peak periods, citing its London-Vancouver run during the Winter Olympics in February as an example.</p>
<p>"Adding flights at this point in the economic cycle takes courage, believe me," Rovinescu told a Vancouver audience gathered for the unveiling of an Olympics-branded Boeing 777 last week.</p>
<p>Courage probably isn't the word for it. Air Canada needs $600 million (Canadian) in financing to stave off insolvency.</p>
<p>Already the world's 14th-largest carrier, with more than 330 aircraft, what Air Canada needs is a thorough restructuring to get its costs down to within shouting distance of WestJet's.</p>
<p>"In the interim," airline analyst Fadi Chamoun of UBS Securities told Canadian Press last week, "equity holders will likely bear the brunt of the costs related to securing sufficient cash resources to bridge the liquidity gap until the economy recovers."</p>
<p>Air Canada shareholders have already suffered an 80 per cent drop in the value of their shares over the past year.</p>
<p>We need Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson to reprise their 1978 hit "Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys." The vocation you want to steer them clear of is airline executive.</p>
<p>"This industry is always in the grip of its dumbest competitors," Robert Crandall, long-time CEO of American Airlines, once complained.</p>
<p>"We have no choice but to match whatever low fare anybody puts out there.</p>
<p>"And so it will get as bad as they want it to get."</p>
