<p>This fall's seasonal flu shot in the Northern Hemisphere should protect against the pandemic H1N1 virus, the World Health Organization recommended yesterday.</p>
<p>After four days of meetings, a committee of experts decided the pandemic H1N1 strain should be among the mix of viruses covered by the coming vaccine for the 2010-11 flu season.</p>
<p>"The inclusion of the H1N1 pandemic virus in the influenza vaccine does not signal that the pandemic is over," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, special adviser to the WHO, told reporters at a news conference in Geneva.</p>
<p>"This virus is expected to be a significant threat to people as we go into next year's fall and winter period."</p>
<p>The WHO holds meetings every February and September to recommend what should be included in seasonal flu vaccines for the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, based on the dominant strains they expect to be circulating in those regions when the flu season arrives.</p>
<p>Vaccines are reformulated every year to offer maximum immunity, because flu viruses mutate and can change from one season to the next.</p>
<p>Canada and many other nations use trivalent seasonal flu vaccines, which means one shot protects against three influenza strains.</p>
<p>In addition to the pandemic H1N1 virus, the other recommended strains to be included in the seasonal vaccine are H3N2 and a variety of influenza B.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 pandemic started in the spring of 2009, eventually making its way around the world, the seasonal flu vaccine was already under production.</p>
<p>A separate H1N1 vaccine was created and was available to Canadians in October, meaning some people got two different shots.</p>
<p>About 45 per cent of Canadians rolled up their sleeves for the pandemic vaccine.</p>

<p>RETAILING REPORTER</p>
<p>Weak North American holiday sales at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. signal that the giant discounter may not be able to hold on to all the customers that it won over during the recession.</p>
<p>The lower-than-expected <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> sales, and stronger business at some rivals, also suggest that consumers who traded down to discount retailers haven't permanently changed their buying habits, and are starting to return to their traditional shopping haunts.</p>
<p>“Now we're seeing improved results from some of the stores that really suffered last year,” said Maureen Atkinson, senior partner at retail consultancy J.C. Williams in Toronto. “<span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>'s bounce [in the recession] may not be as sustainable as everyone thought.”</p>
<p>As consumers begin to head back to retailers that specialize in affordable luxuries – and even luxury goods – <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and other discounters may lose their edge as a recessionary destination, pointing to a phenomenon known as “frugal fatigue” among shoppers.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">TJX Cos. Inc</span>., which runs Winners fashion stores in Canada, and <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>. are among chains that saw a lift during the crucial holiday period. Even business at coffee house <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> – home of the $5 Frappuccino – is perking up.</p>
<p>“Obviously with a retailer the size of <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, there always will be those shoppers who switch,” said Shawn Narancich, vice-president of research at investment adviser Ferguson Wellman in Portland, Ore. “The question is if it's happening on a large scale. I would say at this point it's not happening on a large scale.”</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Narancich, whose firm owns 285,000 <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> shares, was disappointed with the retailer's fourth-quarter same-store sales. Those numbers, which are a vital measure of retail health, fell by 1.6 per cent in U.S. stores and 1.1 per cent at Canadian outlets.</p>
<p>Ms. Atkinson said that some frugal consumers in the recession probably decided to set aside their cautious ways and splurge in their holiday shopping. High-end chains, ranging from men's clothier Harry Rosen to U.S. department store retailer Saks, were beneficiaries of the shift in attitude. “People do want luxuries in their lives – even affordable luxuries.”</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>'s sales were hit by price deflation in groceries and electronics, added John R. Lawrence, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Morgan Keegan & Co</span>. in Memphis. “If the trends don't pick up a little bit, people will start to question if people are feeling better and moving to other places.”</p>
<p>But mainstream Americans are still feeling the pain of unemployment and rising debt and thinking twice about purchasing discretionary products, he said. “Everybody had hoped <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>'s sales would be a little better,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>'s disappointing sales, the retailer showed strong cost controls and improved profit margins, he added. “Now the question is, can they keep some of the gains?”</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> executives, in releasing results yesterday, acknowledged that its U.S. operations still face weak sales. Excluding fuel, it forecast essentially no sales growth at stores open at least a year, within a range of up to 1 per cent to a decline of 1 per cent in the current quarter.</p>
<p>“U.S. sales will be more challenging in the first quarter, as Wal-Mart U.S. cycles through strong year-over-year comparisons and deflation,” chief executive office Mike Duke said. “We remain focused on growing top-line sales and expect improvement in the United States as the year progresses.</p>
<p>In Canada, <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> said sales were pinched by unseasonably mild winter weather, which squeezes business in boots and snow shovels. It also pointed to the H1N1 scare and the overall weak economy. Customer traffic slipped 0.5 per cent from a year earlier, while the average purchase fell 0.6 per cent.</p>

<p>There is something distinctly missing from this year's flu season – the flu.</p>
<p>After a busy fall, when the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infected thousands, dominated headlines and caused hysteria, it has dropped off the radar. But it's not only the pandemic strain that's disappeared, there doesn't seem to be much seasonal flu circulating either.</p>
<p>“In the past, you have peaks, hills, valleys. This is like the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and it's been going like this for weeks,” said Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital. “I would have thought that as soon as H1N1 dips, the vacuum would be filled with H3N2 and even seasonal H1N1. But nothing, nada.”</p>
<p>The dearth of influenza, not just here, but in the United States as well, has doctors and health officials collectively scratching their heads. Has pandemic H1N1 replaced the seasonal viruses? And if so, has its early spread delayed – or perhaps even prevented – the normal flu season?</p>
<p>Not too long ago, labs across the country churned out tests confirming the presence of one positive influenza specimen after another. Today, the Ontario public lab, for example, may get about 100 to 200 specimens a day for testing, but the tide has clearly turned.</p>
<p>“It's been weeks since we've had a positive” for H1N1 or seasonal flu, Dr. Low said. Respiratory syncytial virus, a bug that causes respiratory tract infections, is the only thing spreading at the moment.</p>
<p>Dr. Low wondered if somehow the people exposed to H1N1 or vaccinated against it sustained a level of protection against other influenza viruses that diminishes their ability to take hold. “It's not what we consider great protection, and not enough that we would feel comfortable in saying that somebody is immune. But there's a lot we don't understand about protection,” he added.</p>
<p>Indeed, flu viruses are as finicky and unpredictable as ever. Just like an unwelcome guest, they come and go as they please. Seasonal strains have been replaced by pandemic strains, and there is every reason to believe the pandemic H1N1 will cause illness next winter and the winter after that.</p>
<p>For now though, Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said the flu is in hiding. After a few years of wimpy influenza seasons, this would mark the wimpiest one yet, he said.</p>
<p>To some degree, the disappearance of H1N1 in Canada can be explained: Because about 45 per cent of Canadians have been vaccinated, and another 30 per cent were diagnosed with it and are thus immune, there are fewer people to infect, makingits spread that much more difficult. But explaining the absence of seasonal influenza gets tricky. Perhaps it's because of a mild winter, which prevents the flu from circulating as fiercely. Perhaps it's because the seasonal flu strains have run out of steam and enough people are immune to them.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps this flu season has behaved like other pandemic years with an early surge that then peters out.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: The peak of flu season has come and gone. It's unusual, but not out of the realm of possibility, to see flu resurface in March.</p>
<p>“There's still time. But that being said, every week that goes by with no flu, it gets harder to keep pushing that idea, because it's simply not out there,” Dr. Gardam said.</p>
<p>While watching for influenza's next move, health experts are also focusing on the next season. There could be the possibility of H3N2 returning. But if only pandemic H1N1 resurfaces, it will be good news, because there is an effective vaccine to protect young people and pregnant women, who are among the most vulnerable, and it causes less morbidity and mortality than H3N2, which disproportionately affects the elderly.</p>
<p>Kevin Forward, chief of the division of microbiology at Capital Health in Halifax, said there haven't been enough pandemics of late to make a confident prediction regarding influenza's pattern.</p>
<p>“I would agree with the speculation that the pandemic flu is likely to evolve into a seasonal flu and that we will see it. Whether it's this year or next year remains to be seen,” Dr. Forward said. “But there is enough in other parts of the world. The virus is still alive and spreading in other areas.”</p>
<p>Dr. Forward said the lab in Nova Scotia has had a “very occasional positive test” for influenza. But, like other experts, he's knows better than to give up on this year's flu season entirely.</p>
<p>“It will turn up when it's darn good and ready,” he said.</p>

</p>
<p>The recession helped boost overall sales at giant discounter <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Canada</span> as shoppers traded down to cheaper stores in search of savings.</p>
<p>Sales at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Canada</span> rose 2.6 per cent in the last three months of the year, which includes the Christmas holiday period, the company's U.S. parent reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Operating income grew faster than sales as the Canadian unit cut costs, the U.S. company also said.</p>
<p>But even <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> wasn't immune from the trend toward more cautious spending.</p>
<p>Sales at stores open more than a year declined 1.1 per cent, due both to a decline in the number of customers and the fact those customers spent less.</p>
<p>Sales growth in food and consumables was partly offset by weakness in the apparel and general merchandise categories.</p>
<p>The company blamed unseasonably mild weather, the impact of the H1N1 scare and a weak economy.</p>
<p>For the full year, same-store sales were "flat." <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> operated 317 stores at the end of the quarter, including 84 supercentres, which contain a full grocery store and pharmacy as well as general merchandise.</p>
<p>The results at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Canada</span>, the second largest retailer in Canada after Loblaw, and the largest general merchandise retailer, reflect "a very cautious consumer," Keith Howlett, an analyst at Desjardins Securities, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>"We expect this to be reflected across fourth-quarter results of discretionary retailers in Canada," Howlett also said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Loblaw reported that sales at its stores fell 7.8 per cent in its fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Canadian Tire's sales fell 5.7 per cent during a similar three-month period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the U.S., <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>., one of the recession's biggest beneficiaries, said it felt the pinch as quarterly sales at its U.S. stores fell for the first time in memory.</p>
<p>They were down 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Total sales, including stores outside the U.S., rose 4.4 per cent to $112.8 billion, (U.S.).</p>
<p>But sales at stores open at least a year, considered a key retail measure, fell 1.6 per cent, the company also said.</p>
<p>Earnings beat analysts' expectations, jumping 22 per cent to $4.63 billion, or $1.21 per share, as the company cut costs.</p>
<p>The company also offered a tepid earnings outlook, saying its core budget-conscious customer continues to face challenges while it may be unable to hang on to more affluent customers once the economy improves.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, which generated a little more than $400 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year, is considered a key barometer of consumer spending.</p>

</p>
<p>CALGARY</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. will be adding capacity to sunny holiday spots abroad, as it expects to face continuing pressure on the prices it can charge for fares within Canada.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of 2010, the Calgary-based carrier will direct upwards of 40 per cent of its capacity toward the transborder market, especially southern locations, as the strong Canadian dollar encourages consumers to go on vacation.</p>
<p>"We're also seeing some great pricing from our partners in the hotel business and we're able to pass along some of those savings," said company chief executive officer Sean Durfy on a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results.</p>
<p>Despite the worst economic downturn in decades, WestJet ended 2009 with its 19th consecutive profitable quarter, though earnings and revenue were sharply lower than in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p>"Throughout 2009, reduced business spending, elevated unemployment rates and depressed consumer confidence meant that demand for air travel was under severe pressure. Pricing quickly followed, and this held true for all of 2009," Durfy said.</p>
<p>In addition, the airline industry grappled with volatile fuel prices, the H1N1 flu scare that caused Canada to advise against travel to Mexico last spring before the disease spread globally and enhanced security measures following a botched bombing aboard a Chicago-bound <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span> flight on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>"In light of all these obstacles, I am ecstatic and extremely pleased with this morning's results," Durfy said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company reported a nearly 52 per cent drop in fourth quarter profit from the same time in 2008, but Durfy noted his airline's ability to stay in the black during such a tough year shows its "business model works even in the darkest times."</p>
<p>The net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $20.2 million, or 14 cents per share, down from $42 million, or 33 cents per share, during the corresponding 2008 quarter.</p>
<p>Revenue was down 7.4 per cent to $570 million from $615.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p>WestJet beat analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters, which called for five cents per share in earnings and $562 million of revenue.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, WestJet is continuing to grow its business.</p>
<p>An interline pact between WestJet and European carriers <span class="companylink">Air France</span> and KLM is now in effect.</p>
<p>That type of arrangement sees airlines work together on baggage handling and other services so that passengers can more seamlessly travel from one airline's network to another.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Air France</span> and KLM flights now go directly into four Canadian gateways and are able to access 11 destinations in all, with more being added this year.</p>
<p>Later in the year, up to four more inbound interline partnerships could be brought into the fold.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter, it added five new aircraft, for a year-end total of 86. Its fleet of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 737s will increase to 88 by the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>WestJet Airlines planes sit on the tarmac at Calgary Airport on Tuesday. The chief executive of the airline company says he remains wary of reports of an economic recovery. THE CANADIAN PRESS    </p>

</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines</span> passengers can look forward to fare increases this year as the Calgary-based airline moves to recover ground lost due to the recession, flu scares and costly security enhancements at airports.</p>
<p>WestJet, Canada's second-largest airline, was one of only a few carriers in North America to stay in the black during the fourth quarter, although the company's adjusted net profits dropped 64 per cent to $15.1 million, or 11 cents per share.</p>
<p>Chief executive Sean Durfy said the airline plans to substantially improve its bottom line this year on efficiencies and fare increases.</p>
<p>"A lot of it will be through improved yields on our fares, getting our fare prices up, because they have been very low because of demand and the recession," Durfy said.</p>
<p>The airline will be revamping seat sales and their timing, as well as making flight schedules more efficient to boost revenues, he said.</p>
<p>Increased partnerships with international carriers such as KLM and <span class="companylink">Air France</span> also are expected to boost returns, Durfy added. He declined to provide guidance on potential earnings increases.</p>
<p>WestJet rode through a turbulent 2009 as the airline industry overall suffered one of its steepest declines in passenger numbers, slammed by the global economic downturn and the H1N1 flu scare.</p>
<p>Despite what were dreary industry outlooks, WestJet results beat Street expectations for fourth-quarter revenue per available seat mile, reporting a 10 per cent decrease in the industry measure rather than the 11 per cent to 13 per cent slide it had warned of in December.</p>
<p>"They beat most people's expectations on the unit revenue, and that was really the main driver behind the better-than-expected earnings," said analyst Cam Doerksen, with Versant Partners in Montreal.</p>
<p>The key component people will be looking for in WestJet this year will be ongoing improvement in demand and unit revenue, which will depend on a stronger economy, Doerksen said.</p>
<p>Investors might be concerned about the strategy of increasing the carrier's capacity by nine or 10 per cent during a time of economic uncertainty and relatively weak demand, he noted.</p>
<p>"We have to wait and see if there will be the demand there to fill the seats," Doerksen said. " I don't think it will be a major problem for them, but there could be some pressure on pricing in the early part of this year, unless demand picks up as expected."</p>
<p>WestJet added five new planes to its fleet during the fourth quarter, to end the year with 86 aircraft. The corporation will further expand its stable of 737 jets by two before the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter capacity rose 2.9 per cent from a year earlier, pulling down yield, or revenue per revenue passenger mile, to 11 per cent due to fare discounting. The load factor rose to 78.4 per cent from 77.6 per cent during the quarter.</p>
<p>The company forecast a seven per cent rise in capacity during the first quarter of 2010 from the same period in 2009, and a decline of less than five per cent in its revenue per available seat mile on an improved economy.</p>
<p>Durfy noted the company was close to untangling booking issues associated with its change to the Sabre reservation system in the fall, saying it was reaching pre-transition speed on customer calls, to within seven minutes, and that problems with airport kiosks were close to resolution.</p>
<p>WestJet's frequent flyer and cobranded credit card with the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> will be launched in March.</p>
<p>Analysts saw both reservation system and card programs as attracting more business through new code-share partners and business travellers.</p>
<p>Revenue during the quarter fell seven per cent to $570 million, but was ahead of the mean estimate of $562 million. The airline's operating margin was 6.3 per cent during the quarter, down from 9.6 per cent a year prior, primarily on lower fuel costs.</p>
<p>For the year, WestJet saw adjusted earnings fall 48 per cent to $93.1 million, or 71 cents per share. Revenues for 2009 fell 10.5 per cent from the prior year to $2.28 billion.</p>

<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. reported a steep 64-per-cent drop in adjusted fourth-quarter profit Wednesday, as Canada's second-biggest carrier was unable to avoid industry-wide problems with an H1N1 scare and increased security measures at airports.

<div id="hd"><b>Hospital to lock up hand-sanitizer dispensers -</b>
</div><div>By Gabrielle Giroday    </div>

</p>
<p>THE Health Sciences Centre will begin padlocking some of its hand-sanitizer dispensers in an effort to cut down on theft and potential abuse.</p>
<p>The move came after the province's largest hospital realized as many as 116 bags of alcohol-based sanitizer were disappearing monthly from its wall dispensers.</p>
<p>Craig Doerksen, HSC divisional director of facility management and maintenance services, said hospital maintenance workers came up with a design to lock up sanitizer dispensers to stop people from stealing the one-litre bags from inside. Police say people are misusing sanitizer by adding salt to it and then drinking the liquid, which poses serious health risks. "Theft has been a big issue," said Doerksen. "We've been tracking that."</p>
<p>The hospital has between 150 to 175 dispensers in common areas like elevator lobbies and entrances, he said, as well as an estimated 400 dispensers in more private areas like patient rooms and clinic offices.</p>
<p>The trial project will focus on padlocking 20 to 25 of the highest-targeted dispensers in public areas so officials can see if they can stem thefts. It costs between $25 to $40 to modify each dispenser.</p>
<p>"It's theft of property. While it may not be viewed as high-value property, nonetheless, it is theft," he said.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunately a product that can be misused."</p>
<p>Police said the growth of hand-sanitizer abuse came in the wake of the H1N1 flu virus last April when the dispensers suddenly became ubiquitous. However, Doerksen said, in early 2009 the hospital had already started installing the 150-plus public dispensers before H1N1 hit. But locking up the sanitizer might not solve the theft issue, said Doerksen.</p>
<p>"If we lock the containers up, that might just mean the person kicks the whole thing off the wall and steals the product anyways, and now I have a broken wall to fix in addition to a dispenser."</p>
<p>He said it's unknown why people are taking the sanitizer, but staff haven't found evidence like empty bags around the hospital indicating people are drinking it there.</p>
<p>An HSC spokeswoman said they'll also be introducing signs on some public dispensers that tell people sanitizer is for hand-use only and not for drinking.</p>

</div><div>Irfan Dhalla   </div>
<div>768 words</div><div>18 February 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>When H1N1 influenza seemed poised to kill tens of thousands of Canadians, governments across Canada did a wonderful thing: they made the antiviral medication Tamiflu available free to anyone who needed it.</p>
<p>But why take an equitable approach to one prescription medication and continue the inequitable approach for all the rest?</p>
<p>The eligibility criteria in our current patchwork system make little sense.</p>
<p>In Ontario, for example, bank executives who are 65 or older have their medications paid for by government, while 64-year-old taxi drivers pay for everything on their own dime. With a considerable number of life-prolonging medications costing thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars per year, most people cannot afford to pay for these medications out of their own income or savings.</p>
<p>Most everyone agrees that leaving prescription medications out of medicare was a mistake. The thornier issue is how this mistake can be overcome.</p>
<p>Here are three things governments could do to take universal Pharmacare from dream to reality.</p>
<p>First, governments should focus relentlessly on effectiveness and cost when deciding what drugs to pay for and how much to pay for them.</p>
<p>Although there are reasonably robust national and provincial processes for assessing the effectiveness of new medications, governments rarely scrutinize older medications in the same manner. Some of these medications are only minimally effective and some are even harmful. For example, geriatricians have produced a list of drugs that are so harmful they should virtually never be prescribed to older adults. Yet not a single provincial drug plan has placed restrictions on most of these drugs.</p>
<p>Another area where there is obvious waste is in the pricing of generic medications. Why do we continue to pay flat rates of 50 per cent or more of the brand name price for generic medications when other governments, like Britain's, pay as little as 10 per cent? Pharmacies and generic drug makers are, of course, happy to share the excess profit - at taxpayers' expense.</p>
<p>Second, governments should do away with public subsidies for private health insurance.</p>
<p>Right now, most Canadians with steady jobs are provided with private health insurance by their employers. What many people don't know is that government subsidizes these plans because the employer's contribution is exempt from income tax. And because these subsidies are proportional to the highest income tax rate paid by an individual, those with the highest incomes benefit the most.</p>
<p>Many of these private plans (including my own) pay for non-essential services such as massage and naturopathy. At the same time, self-employed individuals with lower incomes have to pay the full cost of life-saving medications out of pocket.</p>
<p>These inefficient and unfair subsidies received considerable attention in the U.S. when Senator John McCain pledged to get rid of them in his presidential campaign. Outside Quebec, however, they have received little attention in Canada.</p>
<p>Are there Canadian politicians courageous enough to follow Quebec's lead and vigorously campaign for the removal of the private health insurance subsidy?</p>
<p>A pharmacare program that covers everyone could be paid for in part by eliminating the private health insurance tax subsidy. But that won't be enough.</p>
<p>The rest of the money should come from a courageous third step - an income-dependent insurance premium. Everyone who paid the premium would be treated the same way, just as with Tamiflu and H1N1. The new tax - let's call it what it is - might be a hard sell, but polls have repeatedly indicated that a sizable share of the public, often a majority, is willing to pay more for better health care.</p>
<p>Deliberative bodies like Ontario's newly formed Citizens' Council could be asked to consider this issue. And physician organizations could be asked to champion the new insurance premium if it were felt to be in the public interest.</p>
<p>The egalitarian impulse we had when faced with H1N1 was reassuringly Canadian. We were furious to discover that hockey teams and private clinics were getting the flu vaccine first, but pleased to know that Tamiflu would be available to everyone who needed it.</p>
<p>With federal and provincial budgets soon to be released, now is the time for governments to act on that Canadian impulse and build universal pharmacare.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Media wrong to publish anti-prorogation diatribes</b>
</div><div>David Tkachuk   </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>784 words</div><div>18 February 2010</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>Following is the viewpoint of Tkachuk, a Conservative senator from Saskatoon.</p>
<p>Beware of op-eds that appeal only to your emotions, disregarding your intellect. They have no place in a reputable newspaper and the first line of defence against such drivel should be the paper's editors. Judging by the state of debate on Prime Minister Stephen Harper's decision to prorogue Parliament, most aren't doing their job.</p>
<p>The media alone is not at fault. The "fury" over prorogation is driven by opposition parties that have a vested interest in creating the false impression that prorogation is a serious breach of the rules, something out of the ordinary, and a threat to democracy.</p>
<p>That is the job of the opposition, and is to be expected in a healthy and thriving democracy like Canada's. Of course, latching on to this particular non-issue smacks of the kind of desperation expected of parties that can't find anything substantive to criticize about the government: We weathered the economic storm better than any other developed country, and not one of our banks had to be bailed out; there is an all-party agreement on Afghanistan and our military effort there has been the envy of our allies; our response to the earthquake in Haiti has been flawless; and the H1N1 pandemic was managed smoothly, much to the chagrin of the opposition that desperately tried to politicize the issue.</p>
<p>What is not be expected is for the media to aid and abet the opposition by publishing articles and opinion pieces that are little more than ill-informed diatribes filled with scare-mongering and baseless arguments.</p>
<p>A good example, although hardly the only one I've come across, is the piece printed recently in The StarPhoenix headlined, Act to save democracy in Canada (Feb. 11) by Howard Klein, who seems to be under the impression that Prime Minister Stephen Harper's proroguing of Parliament is a strike against democracy -- his second strike, if Klein is to be believed.</p>
<p>Far from being a normal and well-used instrument of parliamentary democracy, "Harper's second proroguing," Klein argues, "introduces a cancerous growth that can be doctored and cured only by an aroused citizenry that believes in democracy and wishes to save Parliament, whatever its inadequacies."</p>
<p>Unless people act, Klein writes, democracy slowly dies while Harper is doing "more important work -- like 24/7 politicking to gain a parliamentary majority? If he succeeds, he will reveal his vision which may include closing down the CBC, ignoring selected rights and filling prisons. Ten years from now, will Canada exist?"</p>
<p>Yes it will, I assure you. Klein's arguments would be laughable if they were just some rant on the Internet, but these are printed in a reputable newspaper.</p>
<p>They include an implicit comparison of the Harper government to Hilter's Third Reich. That's despicable.</p>
<p>Democracy is alive and well in Canada. There can be no better demonstration of that than the printing of Klein's ridiculous article in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Prorogation has done not one thing to stop those who want to voice their opinion against the government and its policies.</p>
<p>Democracy is not under threat by prorogation. Democracy is simply not that fragile. It is made up of many parts and prorogation is one of them. The recent outcry against it by the Liberals and their supporters flies in the face of the fact that the Liberals themselves have resorted to prorogation time and again throughout Canadian history for a variety of reasons, including party self-interest.</p>
<p>Liberal PM Lester Pearson prorogued twice during the 26th Parliament.</p>
<p>One of those times was on Dec. 21, 1963, seven months after his government's speech from the throne. Parliament did not return until Feb. 18, 1964.</p>
<p>Democracy managed to survive and, surprise, Canada existed a decade later.</p>
<p>Liberal PM Jean Chrétien prorogued Parliament in 2003 for no other reason than to avoid wearing a scathing auditor general's report that was due to be released imminently. Was Klein imploring his fellow citizens then to rise up and defend democracy?</p>
<p>Bob Rae, the chief Liberal critic of Harper's suspension, when he was Premier of Ontario prorogued his government more often than anyone else in modern Canadian political history -- three times in five years. Now Ontario Liberal Premier McGuinty has prorogued. Another assault on democracy? Another Hitler?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Prorogation is a prerogative of governments in Canada. If anything, Prime Minister Harper acted in the interest of democracy last year by proroguing when the opposition was preparing to rule by questionable democratic means through a coalition government.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Why cooling housing market may precede a spring rush; Plus, why Britain and Argentina are feuding over the Falklands again. And, why Dennis Gartman is enjoying ‘hockey crazy' Canada</b>
</div><div>Michael Babad  </div>
<div>1637 words</div><div>17 February 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Today's top stories from Report on Business :</p>
<p>Home buying rush expected in spring</p>
<p>Canada's housing market remained vibrant in January, though showed signs of cooling from December. Year over year, resales rose 58 per cent in January, though from a depressed state a year earlier, the Canadian Real Estate Association said today, and prices rose almost 20 per cent, bringing the national average to $328,537. From a record-setting December, though, January sales dipped 2.8 per cent.</p>
<p>That may be the calm before the storm. Analysts expect a hot spring real estate market given Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's move to tighten mortgage standards yesterday. Even before Mr. Flaherty's announcement, home buyers had been expected to rush to beat the harmonized sales tax in Ontario and British Columbia. Now, there's added pressure for the spring with an expected rush to beat Mr. Flaherty's new qualifying standards that come into effect April 19. Economists project a spike in sales, and prices, followed by a cooling period. “The effect of the tightened mortgage rules will be to spur avoidance activity before the new rules become truly effective in July after the pipeline commitments on preapprovals burn off,” Scotia Capital economists Derek Holt and Karen Cordes said in a research note today. “That avoidance behaviour will also apply to the HST that dings new homes in Ontario and B.C. after Canada Day. Thus, look for a very strong spring market that transfers sales from [the second half of] 2010 and beyond into [the first half] of 2010 and drives house prices even further into record territory.”</p>

<p>U.S. home construction on rise</p>
<p>Housing starts in the United States surpassed expectations for January, rising 2.8 per cent to the best level in half a year. While that raises hopes for the battered U.S. housing sector, building permits fell 4.9 per cent. Referring to the construction starts, BMO Nesbitt Burns senior economist Jennifer Lee said “January's rise is akin to expecting a quad-triple combination from Plushenko and getting a double-axel instead. It's okay, but not great.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-housing-starts-rise-28/article1470888/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-housing-starts-rise-28/article1470888/])</p>
<p>Fed sees better growth, high unemployment</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve sees unemployment continuing to run high, despite better-than-expected projections for economic growth. In a forecast released today, the U.S. central bank expects the jobless rate to run at 9.6 per cent in the last few months of the year, down only a notch from January's 9.7 per cent. It expects unemployment to fall next year to as low as 8.2 per cent, and then to as low as 6.6 per cent, though as high as 7.5 per cent, by 2012. The Fed also projects the U.S. economy will expand by somewhere between 2.8 per cent and 3.5 per cent this year.

<p>Toyota to install brake override mechanism</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. said today it plans to put brake-override systems in its cars that would see the brakes engaged, but not the accelerator, when both pedals are pushed. Toyota also said it is studying the possibility of a recall of the Corolla in the wake of complaints over power steering, which number less than 100. In Tokyo today, Toyota president Akio Toyoda also told reporters he will not appear at U.S. congressional hearings related to the auto maker's massive recalls. And in a frank admission, he said the company may have expanded too quickly, and will establish centres for quality improvement at operations globally. “The basic rule of the Toyota Production System is to only build as many cars as there is demand for, and we ourselves broke that rule,” he said.

<p>Britain, Argentina feud over Falklands again</p>
<p>Argentina and Britain are at it again over the Falkland Islands, but this time it's over the vast energy resources in the region. Tensions between the two countries, which went to war over the islands in 1982, have been mounting. British oil companies want to explore in the region, and some areas have been licensed for development, the Associated Press reported. Argentina, the wire service said, has warned that vessels heading from the mainland to the Falklands will need a license, but Britain rejects that. Almost 1,000 people died in the brief war in the 1980s. Argentina's deputy foreign minister Victorio Taccetti told a local radio station today that the country will take measures to block exploration but “obviously by peaceful means.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/argentina-britain-feud-over-falklands-oil/article1471279/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/argentina-britain-feud-over-falklands-oil/article1471279/])</p>
<p>Rogers boosts dividend</p>
<p>Rogers Communications Inc. hiked its annual dividend by 10 per cent this morning, to $1.28 a share, as it posted a stronger fourth quarter, swinging to a profit of $310-million or 51 cents a share from a loss of $138-million or 22 cents a year earlier. Revenue increased to $3.06-billion from $2.94-billion, on the back of a 5-per-cent rise in wireless revenue and 3-per-cent increase in cable revenue. Rogers also projected that its adjusted operating profit would rise 2 per cent to 7 per cent this year. It forecast wireless and cable revenue will each increase 3 per cent to 6 per cent this year, while media revenue gains 4 per cent to 9 per cent. Citing “good results and conservative guidance against high expectations,” UBS Securities Canada analyst Phillip Huang wrote that “we believe an established track record of dividend growth will help lower the stock's risk profile, appeal to a broader base of investors, and provide downside support.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rogers-boosts-its-dividend/article1470772/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rogers-boosts-its-dividend/article1470772/])</p>
<p>Loblaw profit, sales dip</p>
<p>Three years into a renewal effort, Loblaw Cos. Ltd. expects a challenging year. The grocery chain this morning posted a fourth-quarter profit of $165-million or 60 cents a share, compared to $190-million or 70 cents a year earlier as sales fell to $7.31-billion from $7.75-billion. Same-store sales, a key measure, fell 7.8 per cent but there was an extra week in the same quarter of last year. On an equivalent 12-week basis, Loblaw said, same-store sales dipped 0.7 per cent. “We are three years into our renewal program and making progress with two of the toughest years ahead,” executive chairman Galen G. Weston said in a statement. “As we enter 2010, we continue to expect sales and margins to be challenged by deflation and increased competitive intensity.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/loblaw-sees-tough-times-ahead/article1470868/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/loblaw-sees-tough-times-ahead/article1470868/])</p>
<p>WestJet profit slumps</p>
<p>WestJet Airlines Ltd. posted a 52-per-cent drop in profit in the fourth quarter, its 19th consecutive quarter of profitability and seen by analysts as good results. WestJet profit fell to $20.2-million or 14 cents a share from $42-million or 33 cents. Excluding a tax credit, WestJet's profit was $15.1-million or 11 cents a share. The airline cited the industry's challenges of reduced business spending, rising unemployment, lower consumer confidence, fears of the H1N1 flu and additional security measures. The company noted that four quarters of profitability in the horrendous year that was 2009 demonstrated its “solid” business model, while chief executive officer Sean Durfy said on a conference call that “I still am seeing some softness domestically and we are still seeing tremendous pricing pressure in the industry.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/westjet-quarterly-profit-plunges/article1471067/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/westjet-quarterly-profit-plunges/article1471067/])</p>
<p>Gartman in ‘hockey crazy' Canada</p>
<p>Dennis Gartman appears to be enjoying his time in “hockey crazy” Canada. The author of The Gartman Letter on financial markets was speaking in Edmonton today and is scheduled to speak tomorrow in Calgary before flying back to Suffolk, Virginia. “We do like Canada's TV coverage of the Olympics better than the U.S. coverage, and golly is this place hockey crazy as [Jarome] Iginla scored a ‘hat trick' defeating Norway 8-0,” Mr. Gartman said in his news letter today. “The streets of Edmonton were deserted while the game was being televised, and well they should.”</p>

</div><div>GABRIELLE GIRODAY   </div>
<div>Winnipeg Free Press</div>
<div>301 words</div><div>17 February 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>It's an unintended consequence of the fight against H1N1.</p>
<p>Police and social advocates in Manitoba say addicts are abusing hand sanitizer in the wake of the flu virus, when the product flooded store shelves and public buildings last year, by consuming it.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Police Service Sgt. Darrall Randy Kotchon said his officers have found littered sanitizer debris across the city and have received reports indicating the abuse.</p>
<p>Experts say people add salt to the hand sanitizer, which separates pure alcohol from the product with potentially dangerous results.</p>
<p>At one of Winnipeg's main shelters, workers have confiscated sanitizer bottles and stopped leaving salt out on tables; people have to ask to use it.</p>
<p>"It's similar to individuals who are (consuming) ... mouthwash, or they're using hairspray," Kotchon said.</p>
<p>Reports of hand-sanitizer abuse began last year when officers encountered the issue on patrol and from resident reports. Business owners need to be particularly vigilant, he said.</p>
<p>Since H1N1's emergence last April, many public facilities are using sanitizer to combat the spread of germs.</p>
<p>Potential misuse of the product gained prominence last June, when a Senate committee heard federal health officials discuss whether to send hand sanitizer to some remote First Nations battling the H1N1 flu. An official said alcohol in the sanitizer was a concern.</p>
<p>Kotchon said no charges have yet been laid against shop owners for selling hand sanitizers as an intoxicating product.</p>
<p>Under the province's Liquor Control Act, an individual found guilty of selling a non-potable intoxicating substance as a beverage can receive a fine of $2,000 to $20,000 or up to six months in jail.</p>

<p>The Children's Hospital has to come up with a new way to describe its online Ask the Doctor series.</p>
<p>"Webinar" sounds like something that grows between your toes or is sprayed on leather upholstery.</p>
<p>The word may not roll off your tongue, but it's an interesting concept: using the Internet to convey medical advice in an interactive format. This evening, Dr. Melvin Schloss will be talking about ear infections to participants who have registered for the online session. (You can still register at www.thechildren.com/en/news/[http://www.thechildren.com/en/news/])</p>
<p>When we spoke the other day between surgeries (his, not mine), Schloss said children's ear infections are on the rise.</p>
<p>"It's the most common problem presented to doctors," Schloss says, adding that one out of six children have more than one ear infection during the first six years.</p>
<p>Sixes and sickness: what's up with that? "We're not sure why," Schloss admits. One of the causes, he theorizes, is daycare.</p>
<p>"Because of the economic situation, with both parents working, children are popped into daycare at a very early age," Schloss says. "Their resistance to all the bugs that are passed back and forth among little kids has not matured.</p>
<p>"It's a social aspect of our population that's unavoidable. And there's been a huge increase in infections."</p>
<p>Should a child attending daycare wear earmuffs or, just to be on the safe side, a space suit?</p>
<p>Soap and water helps. Cleanliness, our mothers used to say when they stayed home to scrub floors and bake pies, is next to godliness. And it's still true, now that Mom is on the 7:40 train to her office.</p>
<p>A lasting benefit of the H1N1 scare, Schloss says, has been an emphasis on hygiene.</p>
<p>"Kids are being taught to wash their hands," he says, "but there's a certain limit, especially during the winter with a lot of viruses and close contact. Kids are exposed to a lot of things."</p>
<p>Another factor is smoking.</p>
<p>"Smoke contaminates the air," Schloss says, "and it contaminates the protective mechanism in the ears and throat. Children of smokers have a much higher incidence of ear infections."</p>
<p>Schloss is 68 and has been at the Children's Hospital for 40 years. He was born in Alberta, grew up in Vancouver and got his medical degree from U.B.C.</p>
<p>He was a "regular family doctor, carrying a little black bag out to the countryside" in New Westminster.</p>
<p>"I'd visit patients on the farm," he recalls, "and come back with a dozen eggs or a pair of socks."</p>
<p>After a couple of years of Norman Rockwell medicine, Schloss decided to specialize and did an ear, nose and throat residency at McGill. Then he spent a year in France studying middle-ear surgery before returning to teach at McGill and practice at the Children's.</p>
<p>Schloss says he'll begin his Internet talk with 10 to 15 minutes of "basic stuff." This will include a warning that medication is not always the best treatment.</p>
<p>As we talked about preventive measures - good hygiene, healthy diet, smoke-free environment - I asked the doctor if he wanted to throw in a plug for Q-tips.</p>
<p>But Schloss thinks cotton swabbing ears is "ill-advised."</p>
<p>"Don't put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear," he says. "Wax is there for a purpose. It helps protect and lubricate."</p>
<p>And as a "normal mechanism," Schloss adds, ear wax will come out.</p>
<p>What if it happens during a dinner date?</p>
<p>"You have to be careful," Schloss laughed. "Make a discreet move."</p>

<p>The number of cattle farms in Canada has fallen to an 80-year low as ranchers struggle to manage high grain costs and tightening export rules.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said Tuesday fewer than 100,000 farms reported beef or dairy cattle in their operations as of Jan. 1, with cattle herds in Alberta shrinking to seven-year lows.</p>
<p>Across the country only 99,265 farms had cattle on-site, numbers not seen since the census of 1931, said Robert Plourde of Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>"Canadian producers had no incentive to increase their herds," Plourde said. "Grain prices have skyrocketed, there were less American buyers in the fall auction and at the same time the Canadian dollar was stronger, so prices were lower."</p>
<p>Hog farms and cattle herds in Canada and Alberta have shrunk to their lowest levels in more than a decade as high grain prices and the aftermath of tighter border restrictions were felt by the livestock industry in 2009.</p>
<p>Canadian exports of live cattle and calves fell 32 per cent last year, and slaughter levels fell four per cent, Statistics Canada says. Provincial cattle inventories slid 4.3 per cent to 5.15 million year-over-year, and nine per cent since 2004, the federal agency said.</p>
<p>The manager of Alberta Beef Producers wasn't surprised by Tuesday's report, saying the association has been seeing inventories in steady decline, largely because of the global recession and lower prices for pork and poultry.</p>
<p>"Producers have faced a steady series of financial blows," said Rich Smith. "The drought this year was the latest, and of course the global economy has really affected the value of beef."</p>
<p>Cattle farmers in Alberta have been reducing their herds for years, in part due to the aftermath of the first case of mad cow disease slamming the border shut to markets in the United States in May 2003.</p>
<p>Then demand for grain-produced ethanol in North America shot up in 2007, raising grain and feed costs for producers. Last year ranchers were hit by poor grazing due to drought in Alberta, and the U.S. Country of Origin Labelling (COOL) regulations which were fully implemented, reducing the competitiveness of the Canadian export market.</p>
<p>Slaughter cattle have been selling for under $80 per hundredweight, for a loss of about $100 per animal.</p>
<p>"The economic situation in the cattle business has been dismal for seven years," said rancher Erik Butters.</p>
<p>Butters, former chair of the provincial beef association, is counting on reduced beef cattle inventories and rising demand as the economy strengthens to boost the industry this year.</p>
<p>Downsizing of the herd will likely continue into 2011 or 2012, Scott McKinnon, market analyst for Canfax, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Obviously we have an over-capacity in the feedlots and packing plants, and that's going to play a part," he said. "Nothing is going to change until we can stimulate demand."</p>
<p>Although Alberta's cattle herd shrank last year, numbers grew 5.7 per cent in Saskatchewan. The increase there likely reflects Alberta farmers feeding their cattle elsewhere to cope with drought conditions, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>On the hog side, Alberta's number fell 5.3 per cent during the same period to 1.5 million head.</p>
<p>Provincial numbers closely followed a national trend that saw the Canadian breeding herd drop four per cent in 2009. In Alberta, the first province to report a case of the H1N1 or swine flu virus, the impact on the industry was devastating.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doubles luge: It's all downhill after the flu; Tristan Walker struggled through summer training after being struck with H1N1, but he's ready to go now</b>
</div><div>Rob Vanstone   </div>

</p>
<p>Last year, Canadian luger Tristan Walker was flat on his back for reasons that did not pertain to his favourite sport.</p>
<p>Walker was bedridden because of the H1N1 virus, with which he was stricken in June. The illness hampered his training and, by extension, that of men's doubles partner Justin Snith.</p>
<p>"It just floored me,'' Walker recalled Tuesday at the Whistler Sliding Centre after the final training run in advance of Wednesday's Winter Olympics men's doubles event.</p>
<p>"To put it in perspective, at the beginning of summer testing I bench-pressed 95 kilos, and then at the end of the summer I only made it back to 100 kilos for my bench-press testing. It was an entire summer of work to recover from it and I only got that much stronger.''</p>
<p>Complicating matters, Walker opted against taking any medication because of the sport's stringent drug-testing policies.</p>
<p>"Every athlete in every sport has to go through that,'' said Walker, who hails from Bearspaw, Alta., on the northwest city limits of Calgary. "No matter how sick you get, you have to be careful with what you're taking. A lot of times, you just have to fight through it without any medication.</p>
<p>"There's really not much you can take -- nothing that would make it a lot better. Even some of the stuff I was prescribed by the doctors, I wasn't allowed to take.''</p>
<p>Although the virus can be fatal, Walker was not fearful at the time because he had encountered the worst of the symptoms when the diagnosis was made.</p>
<p>There was more of a chill shortly before Christmas when one of his brother's best friends died of H1N1.</p>
<p>"After hearing that, it was kind of a shock, thinking, 'Ooh, I had that disease,' " Walker said. "It could have been a lot worse.''</p>
<p>The worst of the sickness lasted a week, and it took another "two or three" weeks for him to return to 100 per cent. He fell ill at a time when the focus in training was on heavily lifting and adding bulk. In the meantime, Snith forged ahead with his regimen.</p>
<p>"I just had to focus on my training, put it out of my mind, and get as strong as possible and hope that he could make it back to the training sessions and weight sessions as soon as possible,'' said Snith, a Calgary resident.</p>
<p>"I really tried picking up the slack for the couple of weeks that he was gone. It was tough, for sure. We just had to deal with it. That's just one more obstacle that we've overcome. Now we're here and racing [today], so we're looking forward to it.''</p>
<p>Both aged 18, Walker and Snith are the youngest men's doubles team in the Olympics.</p>
<p>They recently ascended to the national senior team after excelling with the junior squad.</p>
<p>"We weren't even on the CTV website until a month ago,'' Walker noted, "so no one knows who we are and no one expects anything of us.''</p>
<p>That is fine with Walker and Snith, who are savouring their initial Olympic experience.</p>
<p>"This entire year, from making the senior team at the beginning of the season to qualifying for the first World Cup and then realizing that we've qualified for the Olympics, it has just been a whirlwind,'' Walker said with a smile. "I can't even describe it.</p>
<p>"It's just amazing, especially here at home. I have all my friends here.</p>
<p>"My parents are here. It's going to be really cool.''</p>

</p>
<p>It's an unintended consequence of the fight against H1N1.</p>
<p>Police and social advocates in Manitoba say addicts are abusing hand sanitizer in the wake of the flu virus, when the product flooded store shelves and public buildings last year, by consuming it.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Police Service Sgt. Darrall Randy Kotchon said his officers have found littered sanitizer debris across the city and have received reports indicating the abuse.</p>
<p>Experts say people add salt to the hand sanitizer, which separates pure alcohol from the product with potentially dangerous results.</p>
<p>At one of Winnipeg's main shelters, workers have confiscated sanitizer bottles and stopped leaving salt out on tables; people have to ask to use it.</p>
<p>"It's similar to individuals who are [consuming] ... mouthwash, or they're using hairspray," said Kotchon.</p>

<p>Now that fears of the H1N1 flu virus have morphed into relief that it hasn't been worse, let's turn to the regular flu season.</p>
<p>Enter Dr. Bill Sears, the California-based patriarch of the Sears family pediatric franchise, who's also the king of Mom-knows-best lessons about taking care of yourself.</p>
<p>Sears, who with his registered-nurse wife Martha and pediatrician sons Jim and Bob has written a string of anthologies for parents, has a new book out that compiles his tips for living well in middle age and beyond.</p>
<p>It's called Prime-Time Health: A Scientifically Proven Plan for Feeling Young and Living Longer (Little, Brown and Company, $31.99)</p>
<p>Here are some tips from Sears:</p>
<p>* Hot water is preferred for handwashing, but not necessary. "Proper handwashing is always the first line of defence. One of the things we do in our practice is, have families carry around antibacterial wipes, which kill 99.9 per cent of the germs," he says.</p>
<p>* Sears' three Ss -- smoothies, salads and salmon -- are good for boosting the body's natural immune system.</p>
<p>"Blueberries are the No. 1 fruit for boosting the immune system. Pomegranates also are in season now. The neat thing is that coincides with the flu season," he said.</p>
<p>* Flu germs settle in the nose and sinuses first, so keep the nose clean with a saline rinse or spray. If you have central heating, consider a humidifier.</p>
<p>* Use your elbows and feet on the germ gathering places of public bathrooms, like doorknobs and flush handles.</p>
<p>"You go to other countries like Japan, and they're far ahead of us in preventing the spread of germs. A toilet-flusher should be a pedal you push with your feet, not your hands.</p>
<p>"I make a big point of what I'm mentioning to you, which is that the body can muster up its own medicines as long as we take care of it," Sears said. "These are things like your mother told you."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 by the numbers; A typical run-of-the-mill flu season in Canada will see 10 to 25 per cent of the population fall ill, resulting in 20,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths, on average.</b>

</p>
<p>- During severe influenza A outbreaks, it wouldn't be surprising for upwards of 50 per cent of Canadians to become infected, resulting in 30,000 to 40,000 hospitalizations and 6,000 to 8,000 deaths.</p>
<p>- Since the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, there have been a total of 8,582 hospitalized cases and 426 deaths in Canada.</p>
<p>- Worldwide, there have been at least 14,142 deaths due to H1N1.</p>
<p>- In November 2009, seasonal flu and H1N1 kept more than 1.5 million Canadians home from work. that's almost 10 per cent of the national workforce aged 15 to 69.</p>
<p>- Those absences represent a net loss of nearly 21 million work hours across the country.</p>
<p>- The last time the country experienced that kind of loss in hours was during the Ontario-US blackout in 2003.</p>
<p>- The Canadian government purchased 50.4 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine on behalf of the nation, including 1.8 million doses of the unadjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>- Approximately 45 per cent of Canadians have rolled up their sleeves for the H1N1 flu vaccine to date.</p>
<p>- So far in 2010, influenza-like-illness (iLi) consultation rates have been consistently below the expected range for this time of year. the third week of January, for example, saw only 12 iLi-related consultations for every 1,000, which is less than half the mean rate.</p>
<p>- In fact, all influenza-activity indicators for 2010 are either within or below the expected range for a normal flu season.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>did You Know...</p>
<p>Approximately 10 million flu shots are distributed annually in Canada.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Hand-Washing 101</p>
<p>Common sense? perhaps, but many of you still aren't doing it correctly. 1) remove all jewellery. 2) Wet hands with warm water.</p>
<p>3) Use regular liquid soap, wash front and</p>
<p>back, between fingers and under nails. 4) Sing "Happy birthday" to ensure that</p>
<p>you've scrubbed for at least 15 seconds. 5) rinse under warm water for 10 seconds. 6) dry your hands with disposable towel</p>
<p>or clean cloth.</p>
<p>7) Avoid recontamination, use the towel</p>
<p>to turn off the faucet. 8) Moisturize regularly. Cracked dry skin</p>
<p>offers germs a place to hide.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>It's complicated...; The flu--in any form--should not be taken lightly. Unlike its partner in crime, the common cold, this seasonal offender boasts a rap sheet rife with serious, even fatal, complications.</b>
</div><div>National Post</div>
<div>904 words</div><div>17 February 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>MP7</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Ah, cold and flu. the pair are so often mentioned in tandem it's as though they've become one all-encompassing term in the popular vernacular: coldandflu. they are the brangelina of seasonal illnesses (though not nearly as pleasant to look at).</p>
<p>N ot that the link isn't understandable: the two viral infections share many of the same symptoms-- from the stuffy nose to the hacking cough to the scratchy sore throat-- and both are most likely to strike in the winter months. However, whereas common cold complications (e. g. sinusitis, bronchitis, ear infections) are rarely life-threatening and are usually easily treated at home with prescription medication, the health implications of influenza can be much more serious, leading to hospitalization and even death.</p>
<p>Worldwide, annual flu epidemics are thought to be responsible for anywhere between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths each year. in Canada alone, approximately 10 to 25 per cent of the population fall ill over the course a typical flu season, resulting in 20,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths, on average. during severe influenza A outbreaks, those statistics can jump significantly: Up to 50 per cent of Canadians may become infected, leading to 30,000 to 40,000 hospitalizations and a staggering 6,000 to 8,000 deaths.</p>
<p>As with the cold, flu complications can include ear infections and sinusitis, but their reach extends even further to the following, more serious ailments: myositis (muscle inflammation), pericarditis (an infection of the sac surrounding the heart), dehydration and infections of the central nervous system. they can also lead to a worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma and diabetes.</p>
<p>The most prevalent and deadly complication of the flu is pneumonia, an infection of the lungs in which the alveoli (air sacs) fill with pus and mucus. this inflammation reduces the lungs' elasticity, prohibiting oxygen from reaching the blood stream properly. pneumonia typically presents as one of two types--viral or bacterial--both of which can have serious health implications.</p>
<p>Viral pneumonia is the lesser of the two evils. its symptoms, which include (but are not limited to) a low-grade fever, coughing up small amounts of mucus, fatigue and muscle aches, tend to come on slowly and are usually mild enough that they will improve without medical intervention--though in some more extreme cases, hospitalization may become necessary. in those situations, antiviral drugs are prescribed as treatment.</p>
<p>Bacterial pneumonia is far more worrisome. it causes people to feel very sick, very quickly. the most common symptoms are an expulsive cough that produces rust-or green-coloured phlegm, a high fever (up to 41 C), chills, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, chest pains and bluish lips or fingernails due to lack of oxygen. bacterial pneumonia is commonly caused by the bacteria streptococcus pneumonaie and can be treated at home with antibiotics but may sometimes require a hospital stay for special respiratory therapy or intravenous treatment.</p>
<p>A less common, but equally serious complication of the flu is reye's syndrome, which occurs exclusively in children under the age of 18 who have been given salicylates (aspirin) as treatment, usually for fever. reye's syndrome causes damage to the central nervous system and liver, and can be fatal. Never give aspirin to children or teenagers with the flu unless you are specifically instructed to do so by a doctor.</p>
<p>The highest rates of secondary infection and clinical illness following the flu are found in children, but serious complications and deaths occur mainly in the elderly over 65 years of age. Other high-risk populations include pregnant women and those with preexisting health conditions, such as chronic heart, liver or kidney disease, asthma or chronic lung disease, blood disorders, diabetes, severe obesity or a weakened immune system due to cancer or HiV/AidS.</p>
<p>People with these risk factors should call their doctor immediately upon the appearance of flu-like symptoms. Antiviral flu medications, such as tamiflu or relenza, are helpful in reducing one's chance of developing complications. though these drugs won't cure the flu, they can reduce the amount of time you're sick by one or two days and make you less contagious to others if taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Better yet, the government of Canada encourages all Canadians, especially those with an increased risk for complications from influenza, to get the flu shot annually as well as the H1N1 vaccine. the pneumococcal vaccine, which provides immunity against 23 types of bacteria that commonly cause pneumonia, is also recommended for the aforementioned high-risk groups except pregnant women as its safety for that population has yet to be fully evaluated.</p>
<p>A TURN FOR THE WORSE...</p>
<p>Seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the following severe flu symptoms.</p>
<p>- persistent fever (&gt;3 days)</p>
<p>- painful swallowing</p>
<p>- persistent cough (&gt;2 to 3 weeks)</p>
<p>- persistent congestion (&gt;1 week)</p>
<p>- bloody mucus or spit</p>
<p>- Severe chest pain</p>
<p>- Shortness of breath, rapid or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>- Symptoms (e. g. fever, cough) improve but then return, worse than before.</p>
<p>- Low blood pressure</p>
<p>- blue/grey lips or skin</p>
<p>- Sudden dizziness or confusion</p>
<p>- Severe headache</p>
<p>- infrequent urination</p>
<p>- Frequent vomiting</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu 411; What it is, what it ain't and everything in between.</b>
</div><div>National Post</div>
<div>675 words</div><div>17 February 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>MP6</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE FLU?</p>
<p>Simply put, influenza (a. k.a. the flu) is a common respiratory illness that attacks the nose, throat, bronchi and, in rare cases the lungs. it affects an estimated 10 to 25 percent of Canadians annually. in North America, the risk of infection is greatest during flu season, which runs from November through April, but local outbreaks occur worldwide year-round.</p>
<p>The flu is caused by one of the many influenza viruses, which fall into three groups: A, b and C. each group is further broken down into different strains, such as A(H3N2) or A(H1N1).the genetic makeup of influenza viruses allows for frequent mutation, making it impossible for the human body to sustain immunity over time on its own. Flu vaccines--the only surefire way to protect yourself from infection--are reformulated annually to account for these changes.</p>
<p>Influenza A and b are the most prevalent types and pose the highest risk to humans. As such, they are included in the seasonal flu vaccine each year. influenza C, on the other hand, is less common and causes only mild illness in comparison to A and b. it is not typically included in the vaccine.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization's (WHO) Global influenza Surveillance Network is responsible for recommending the annual flu vaccine. this network of more than 100 National influenza Centres in nearly as many countries constantly monitors which viruses are currently circulating in humans and rapidly identifies new strains. based on its findings, WHO recommends an annual vaccine that targets the most virulent strains.</p>
<p>MORE THAN JUST A COLD...</p>
<p>Although flu symptoms often mirror those of the common cold, the latter are typically milder and come on more slowly. When the flu strikes, it does so with a bang and, more often than not, a fever. both illnesses share many of the same symptoms, including a sore throat, cough and stuffy nose, but a cold rarely presents with a temperature of more than 38 C. body and muscle aches are also more common with the flu.</p>
<p>A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY</p>
<p>The common cold isn't the only illness masquerading as the flu. Viral gastroenteritis is often referred to as the "stomach flu," despite the fact that the two illnesses have little in common other than a high risk of contagion. Gastroenteritis-- whether caused by rotavirus, Norwalk or another virus--is marked by stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Although these symptoms can present in children with the flu, they are extremely rare in adults. Fever and body ache--two hallmarks of influenza--are also atypical of gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>PANDEMIC FLU</p>
<p>These days, it's pandemic flu that's on the tip of everyone's tongues. it refers to a new strain of influenza that is able to spread quickly around the globe as humans have little to no immunity against it by virtue of its novelty. Although the flu virus is constantly evolving, people who have had previous bouts of influenza will still usually possess some protection against similar strains of the virus. However, every quarter century or so, a radical enough change occurs such that humans have never experienced anything like it before and are thus completely vulnerable. this was what happened in 2009 when pandemic H1N1, or swine flu, erupted around the world.</p>
<p>AVIAN FLU</p>
<p>Of lesser concern to humans, but worth noting nonetheless, is avian influenza, or bird flu, a type A virus. For most Canadians, the risk of contracting the disease is quite low. it is primarily found in birds and transmitted through their droppings and secretions. However, given the innate mutative ability of flu viruses, there is a chance that avian influenza could mix with a human flu virus and lead to an outbreak of pandemic flu, and thus it is worth our attention. people who handle wild birds are at the highest risk of infection and should take proper precautions when working with fowl.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The cost of the (far too) common cold and flu; Prevention, treatment and knowing the difference</b>
</div><div>By: Sherry Torkos, R. PH., B. SC. PHM., The Canadian
Encyclopedia Of Natural Medicine   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>956 words</div><div>17 February 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>MP2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>C olds and flu are both caused by viruses that infect the respiratory tract--the nose, sinus passages and throat. there are more than 200 viruses that can cause colds; the most common family is known as the rhinoviruses. these are also called "nose viruses", based on a Greek word "rhino" meaning nose. According to statistics, 72 per cent of Canadians get colds each year. Adults average 2.5 colds a year while children contract six to eight per year.</p>
<p>Influenza (the flu) is a respiratory infection caused by viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. As of January 23 there have been 39,020 confirmed cases of influenza (both seasonal and H1N1 flu) in Canada.</p>
<p>The flu can be distinguished from the common cold because it generally results in a more severe illness, with a sudden onset of headache, chills and cough followed rapidly by a high fever, appetite loss, muscle aches, and tiredness. the incubation period for influenza is 24 to 72 hours. Adults with influenza remain infectious for 3 to 5 days after onset of symptoms, and children may remain infectious for up to a week after onset. influenza Typically lasts a week to 10 days.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of cold and flu season and this year has been particularly worrisome for Canadians with the heightened concerns of the H1N1 pandemic. As such, there is also greater interest in strategies for prevention.</p>
<p>Cold symptoms, on the other hand, generally involve the upper respiratory tract with runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and throat irritation. Symptoms usually begin two to five days after initial infection and often resolve in several days to a week.</p>
<p>In some people, especially young children, those over 65 years of age, or people with other systemic illnesses (e. g. heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory illnesses), influenza can be very severe, requiring hospitalization. people with these risk factors should receive immunization against influenza each year.</p>
<p>In Canada, flu season usually runs from November to April however, the 2009-2010 influenza season began earlier this year, in August. the flu is not caused by cold weather, rather it is more common in the winter because humidity is lower and we spend more time indoors, in close contact with one another, making it easier to contract and spread germs. Colds are also more common in the winter, for the same reason as the flu, but they can happen any time of the year.</p>
<p>Catching a cold or flu causes much more than just personal suffering. it is estimated that the social costs of the common cold is $400 million per year which makes it more costly than asthma, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease combined.</p>
<p>The public Health Agency of Canada commissioned Statistics Canada to assess the impact of H1N1 and seasonal flu on hours worked over a three-month period, starting in November, using the Labour Force Survey. According to this report, 1.5 million employed people aged 15 to 69 reported they were absent from work as a result of the H1N1 or seasonal flu, representing 9.0 per cent of workers in that age group. On average, these absent workers lost 19.6 hours of work each, for a total of 29.5 million hours lost.</p>
<p>As a pharmacist I am often asked about what can be done to prevent or treat cold and flu. We have all heard about the importance of vaccination for the flu, and hand washing and covering our mouth and nose when we cough or sneeze to prevent contracting or spreading a cold or flu, but there is much more that can be done to cut your chances of catching a bug this season and it all begins with a strong functioning immune system.</p>
<p>Our immune system is our defense network against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. this network is comprised of millions of cells, tissues and organs, such as the skin, the respiratory system (nose, tonsils, sinuses and lungs) and digestive tract. this complex system works hard every day to protect us against infection and even cancer.</p>
<p>Our immune system, far from being a static and fixed entity, is a dynamic and adaptive process with elaborate communication networks. thus, it can be heavily influenced by a broad variety of factors, including diet and lifestyle. in this report you will learn about strategies to optimize immune system health, the role of supplements and other things that you can do to reduce your risk of getting a bug this season. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>
<p>If you do happen to get sick keep in mind most cases of cold and flu are mild and can be treated by staying home and getting adequate rest, drinking fluids and taking products for symptom relief. it is important to see your doctor if you have any serious medical conditions or if you have a fever greater than 38 Celsius (102 F) along with aching, fatigue, sweating, and chills, or if there is vomiting, ear pain, coloured phlegm, or if symptoms persist longer than 10 days. Contrary to common belief, antibiotics are of no benefit in treating a cold or flu, unless you develop a secondary bacterial infection such as strep throat, bronchitis or pneumonia.</p>

</p>
<p>Soccer - South Africa faces a possible health crisis if a swine flu outbreak strikes during the soccer World Cup this year, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told parliament on Monday.</p>
<p>"One of our biggest nightmares is the fact that 2010 is going to be held in June when there is a possibility of another bout of H1N1," Motsoaledi said.</p>

<p>At 37, Court Carruthers is one of the new leaders of Canadian business – and he's been making his mark at one of its old mainstays. Over the past few years, Mr. Carruthers has been driving culture change at <span class="companylink">Acklands-Grainger Inc</span>., a 121-year-old distributor of industrial supplies. Founded by Winnipeg carriage maker Dudley Ackland in 1889, it collects $750-million in annual sales from 65,000 business customers. It has 165 outlets, and lists about 100,000 items in its door-stopper of a catalogue –everything from bolts to hammers to toilet paper. After serving as president of <span class="companylink">Acklands-Grainger</span>, Mr. Carruthers is now a senior executive for Chicago-based parent <span class="companylink">W. W. Grainger Inc</span>. with responsibility for non-U.S. operations, including Canada.</p>
<p>What's your biggest-selling item?</p>
<p>If you think through the H1N1 crisis, respirator masks have been a hot item over the past year. But our No. 1 selling product line is usually hand tools manufactured under our own brand. It shows <span class="companylink">Acklands-Grainger</span> is a mirror of the Canadian economy. How is that economy doing?</p>
<p>We do cover most industry segments and most customer sizes, from small contractors to the biggest companies – and in every geography. We had a strong finish last year and are off to a good start this year.</p>
<p>So there is cautious optimism but there is also a little bit of two steps forward, one step back. We see much more activity than we saw last year, but I wouldn't say it's unbridled enthusiasm yet. For example, you might see a number of projects in the oil sands and then one or two companies say they are slowing down. Where are you from?</p>
<p>I was born in Saskatoon in a third-generation Saskatchewan family. Part of the family was with the CPR, and part in farming. But I grew up in Innisfail, Alta., and moved to Edmonton as a teenager, and did high school and university there.</p>
<p>My dad has always been an entrepreneur and when we moved to Alberta he owned a construction company. We moved there in the heart of the boom in the late 1970s, so we have seen many booms and busts.</p>
<p>Was there something that drew you into business? My dad and I spent lots of time talking about business. As a true entrepreneur, he has never worked for anyone else in his life, and I grew up seeing all that – the good and the bad, the successes and failures.</p>
<p>I've always been interested in how businesses and economies operate. I love talking to people who run completely different businesses in different sectors. My wife describes me as a business nerd. I take that as a compliment. After working at other companies, what brought you to <span class="companylink">Acklands-Grainger</span>?</p>
<p>There is an amazing opportunity to create an undisputed market leader. You have 121 years of history, a fantastic infrastructure, and we are significantly larger than the next competitor. We have a blue chip customer list, an unlimited product offering and, at the same time, just a 7- to 8-per-cent market share. These kind of factors coming together are rare in a career. I was drawn by this chance to aggressively grow a business, and create something special.</p>
<p>Who are your competitors?</p>
<p>There are a mix of mom-and-pop players, some regional players and some specialists that might be national companies but only compete in one product segment. …</p>
<p>There is a long-term market share/growth opportunity that we are pursuing, both organically and through selective acquisitions. But we really think organic growth is the main driver, because it allows us to ensure we create that fantastic customer experience. In a tough economy in 2009, we built nine new stores, added a West Coast distribution centre and 15,000 new products.</p>
<p>So what was the company doing wrong in the past?</p>
<p>If we look at the transformation over the past three or four years, it was really about making sure we set the customer first. Everyone in the company either serves the customer or serves someone who does. The biggest change was making sure that for every single person – whether they work in a branch or IT or finance – their job is to make a customer's life better. That was there before, but it might not have been our No. 1 focus.</p>
<p>But isn't this a conservative “old economy” company?</p>
<p>We have a mix of folks and it is not uncommon to have second, third and even fourth-generation employees from the same family. We've got a great mix of history and success, but also people who bring new ideas.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be said for experience in this business. We have 110,000 products in stock and we sold 250,000 products last year. You cannot be an expert in every product – it is absolutely impossible. But we do have technical experts in very specific areas such as safety products, welding products and fasteners. We also have a catalogue that weighs 8½ pounds, the largest catalogue printed in Canada. Why not scrap the catalogue and just publish online?</p>
<p>The Web is a critical part of our business and has been rapidly growing even in the downturn. Everything is available on the Web, but think about some of our customers. If you are underground in a mine, if you are working at an oil rig, if you are offshore, if you are in your truck driving around doing maintenance, the Web may not be the right solution. So that's where the book comes in handy.</p>
<p>When you think about the book, how people use it is to figure out what they need. Something breaks, they have it in their hand and they have to figure out what it is. … Or we'll frequently have people bring something into a branch, put it on the counter, and say, ‘I don't know what this is, but it broke and I need another one. Do you know what it is?' It is a very common occurrence and that goes back to deep product knowledge and folks who grew up knowing the business.</p>
<p>How do you, as a young manager, communicate to this older culture?</p>
<p>When I had the chance to become president of the Canadian business in 2006, I had already spent four years in the business in a number of roles. I was intimate with so many facets of the business and I knew a lot of people. I was just tapping into what was latent motivation for success, and so we started painting a picture of what could be – this massive, successful, strong, historical organization that wasn't yet meeting its full potential. We really tapped into existing enthusiasm, and we reorganized the business around the customer. What is the toughest thing you've had to learn?</p>
<p>Your strengths, if overused, can become a weakness. I am very competitive, whether it is about our business being successful or playing sports with my wife or friends. I am driven to win. But as you mature more, you learn how to modulate that so it is used in the right frequency. That's something I haven't fully figured out. It can happen that I am too aggressive. I so much want our company and our teams to win.</p>

</div><div>Tom Randall   </div>

<div>441 words</div><div>14 February 2010</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A55</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Swine flu has killed about 12,000 people in the U.S., disproportionately targeting the young, U.S. health officials reported Friday. The number may fall short of 36,000 patients who die each year from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Almost one in five Americans was infected by swine flu since the virus emerged in April, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
<p>Ninety per cent of the people who died were younger than age 65, the reverse of a typical flu season. There were about 257,000 hospitalizations, about 17 per cent higher than normal.</p>
<p>Swine flu, or H1N1, causes symptoms similar to the seasonal flu in most people, though younger people are more likely to develop severe illness or die.</p>
<p>Seasonal influenza strains never emerged this year and swine flu rates have declined since peaking in late October.</p>
<p>The majority of patients who die from seasonal flu are older than age 80, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>"The fact that there are young healthy people dying and being hospitalized at these rates, that's the important feature of this pandemic," said Beth Bell, associate director for science at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"There are still hospitalizations and deaths being reported. We have ample supply of vaccine, and this is a good time to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>Flu season in the U.S. lasts from November to March. The H1N1 virus continues to circulate in most areas, though it is no longer considered widespread in any U.S. states, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>About 75 million Americans have been vaccinated for H1N1, and 57 million Americans have been infected, which grants immunity, the CDC said.</p>
<p>The pandemic strain will likely be incorporated into next year's seasonal flu vaccine, Bell said.</p>
<p>Swine flu was the first pandemic in 40 years, sweeping the globe faster at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Because the virus targets young people, comparisons of deaths to seasonal flu obscure the full impact of the pandemic, Bell said. More years of potential life are lost when younger people die, she said.</p>
<p>The death toll in today's estimate isn't exactly comparable with the numbers used for a typical season.</p>
<p>The methods used to calculate the swine flu deaths are based on laboratory-confirmed cases that are extrapolated nationwide.</p>
<p>The swine flu toll would be higher if researchers employed the same methods as used for seasonal estimates, which count some complications not directly caused by influenza, Bell said.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>. said yesterday second-quarter revenue from sales of hand sanitizers and other anti-microbial products rose 27 per cent, but it could not keep up with surging demand for face masks during last summer's H1N1 pandemic threat.</p>
<p>As the threat developed from last April, said CEO Andre Leroux, inventories were low because of pressures on working capital, outside supplier delays and distributors' regulatory difficulties.</p>
<p>Demand for face masks and filter products is returning to a more stable growth rate with the threat's decline, he added, but "we expect to benefit from higher volumes of orders over the next few quarters." Noveko posted revenue of $4.98 million in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $3.9 million a year earlier, and it reduced its loss to $5 million from a loss of $6.9 million in the 2008 period.</p>
<p>First-half revenue was $9.5 million, up 53 per cent from $6.2 million a year earlier, and the loss was $9.15 million, down from a loss of $13.48 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Noveko completed financing by private placement last autumn.</p>

<p>Higher rates of H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths among aboriginals than other Canadians demonstrate how basic human rights are not applied equally, according to First Nations physician Dr. Marcia Anderson.</p>
<p>The Manitoba doctor told a gathering at McMaster University yesterday that the right to health is a basic human right that is also tied to a decent standard of living. If social, economic and health policies were applied equally in Canada, there wouldn't be such large health gaps between First Nations and non-aboriginals, she said.</p>
<p>Aboriginals make up 3 per cent of Canada's population, but accounted for 17 per cent of H1N1 hospitalizations, 14 per cent of intensive care cases and 10 per cent of deaths as of September, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, of the 795 confirmed cases to that point, 37 per cent were aboriginals, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Anderson was the keynote speaker at a seminar meant to increase knowledge and awareness of First Nations issues among health professionals.</p>
<p>Anderson said the key social determinants of poor aboriginal health are similar to the socio-economic factors hurting the health of Canada's poor.</p>
<p>"It's not surprising to any of us that aboriginal people have poor health," Anderson said.</p>
<p>Aboriginals have shorter lifespans, higher suicide rates and twice as many single-parent households compared with the rest of Canadians, she said.</p>
<p>Aboriginal women also have higher rates of unemployment and less education, and are more likely to be in the sex trade, incarcerated and victims of violence than other Canadian women, she said. And 42.7 per cent of aboriginal women are in the low-income bracket compared with 20.3 per cent of other women, while one in four First Nations kids live in poverty compared with one in six of all Canadian children, she added.</p>
<p>"Our collective tolerance for injustices is really quite shocking," Anderson said. "In order to address health inequities, we must address the inequities in the way society is organized."</p>
<p>The session was organized by the university's Aboriginal Students Health Sciences Office, which assists aboriginal health sciences students.</p>

<p>When God created the one-of-a-kind gal named Patsy Clairmont, he packed into her five-foot frame, a giant dose of humour, a spitfire personality and a passion for helping women.</p>
<p>The best-selling author of 20-plus books, including God Uses Cracked Pots and I Second That Emotion, has spoken to more than four million women in the past 14 years as a core member of the Women of Faith team.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview from her second home near Nashville, where her husband of 46-plus years, Les, can escape shovelling the snow at their Michigan home, Clairmont talked openly about her life, her ministry and her adult son's recent brush with death from the swine flu.</p>
<p>Q: How old are you?</p>
<p>A: About 900 on a good day. (Real age: 64).</p>
<p>Q: You've often talked about the many years early in your marriage and mothering when you suffered from agoraphobia -- the fear of leaving your house. Have you ever found out what caused that?</p>
<p>A: I can't really identify any one thing. There are those who suggest it is an inheritable trait. After conversations with hundreds and thousands of women, I think it's an accumulation of feelings and experiences that we don't know what to do with, or why they occurred.</p>
<p>None of us grow up without pain from our childhood. This is a fallen world and you can't escape having your feelings hurt, being accused of something you didn't do. That's how life is. You protect your child in every way and then you send them off to school and they get a critical teacher or a playmate who's cruel on the playground. Those feelings don't just go away. They wait for us to catch up.</p>
<p>We are complicated beings. Thankfully, there's one who understands us, but only one (God). We don't get ourselves most of the time.</p>
<p>Q: Your son recently was in the hospital. What happened?</p>
<p>A: It was H1N1, double pneumonia and a severe sinus infection. For 21 days when he was on the ventilator, they did not know if he would live. Marty is 45 years old and lives close to us in Michigan. It is a very hard thing for a mother to sit and measure every breath, wondering if he will be able to take another one. It doesn't matter if he's six years old or 46 years old. I couldn't imagine I was sitting at the bedside of my man-child, my firstborn, and thinking he might (die) first.</p>
<p>While I was telling God how it should go, He reminded me that He was the author and finisher of Marty's life. I didn't get to write the chapter of how his life should end. So I suggested to God that I could be the editor. He reminded me that I was in a few chapters, but I didn't get to write them or edit them. We have no choice who we're born to; we get no choice in how we die. That's between the author and the finisher to each of us individually.</p>
<p>Q: What did you learn from that experience?</p>
<p>A: I was reminded again of the value of staying current in God's word. You're not going to go study and learn during those crises. But there's the promise that if you need His word, he'll bring it up again to comfort you, direct you. And the importance of God's people. I physically and emotionally and spiritually felt the buoying of my own heart because of people praying.</p>
<p>Q: You've been with Women of Faith since it started 14 years ago. Does it ever get old for you?</p>
<p>A: I get tired of the travel. I would like to be the girl who just wiggles her nose and I'll be there. But the privilege has never gone away. To know that (God) allows me to do this is a bit startling. I would never have chosen me. I'm grateful He did.</p>
<p>Q: What is the one message you'd like women to hear?</p>
<p>A: That they are not alone. There are many others struggling with the same thing. The enemy of our souls is a thief and a liar. He comes to discourage us; you see so many women who find themselves depressed, and it starts with discouragement. He robs you of anything that can be of value. When someone says something to us that is very kind or validating, he (Satan) says, "They don't mean it. She doesn't really like you." If women could realize that when those voices come, we don't have to buy into the lies. We are of great value.</p>
<p>There are many things we know about God: He is good and kind and powerful and loving. He extends grace and mercy. But there's so much we don't understand about Him. Women feel alone. There are circumstances in our lives that we don't get. They just dug a woman out in Haiti. She asked, "Why did this happen to me?" It was very personal.</p>
<p>We won't understand a lot until we get to glory. A great deal of who God is, is mystery. That's why they call it faith.</p>
<p>Q: How do you see God?</p>
<p>A: Tender, compassionate. I see it in the Scripture as He dealt with women there, and I see it in my own heart. He understands my frailty and insecurity. He's always bringing those raindrops of mercy and blessing. It comes through a friend who calls or sends an e-mail with a phrase I needed to hear. It comes in a line in a song. It comes in conversation at the dinner table. It can come from a stranger sitting next to me. I've become a mercy-drop catcher. If we don't purpose to find it and see it, we'll miss it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 patients were younger, sicker</b>
</div><div>Sheryl Ubelacker   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>663 words</div><div>12 February 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>H1N1 influenza landed a higher proportion of Canadians in ICUs and on ventilators, and at a much younger age on average, than seasonal flu does in a typical year, says a report assessing the comparative impact of the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>The study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information compared hospitalization statistics for H1N1 patients between April and December to data for patients with regular flu during the 2007-2008 season.</p>
<p>"Initially there were clinical perceptions of the patients: they seemed younger, they seemed sicker," co-author Kathleen Morris said of the H1N1 pandemic that began last April.</p>
<p>"What this does is take a look at all of the H1N1 patients that were hospitalized in Canada and compare them to a full hospitalization (seasonal) flu year, so right across the country," Morris, head of emerging issues at the institute, said Thursday from Ottawa.</p>
<p>"So it gives us a clearer sense of A, whether those findings are confirmed by the data, and B, what magnitude is the difference."</p>
<p>She said researchers were surprised at how big some of the differences were.</p>
<p>"People admitted to hospital with H1N1 were younger than what we'd come to expect in a typical flu year, and those who died were younger, too," said Morris.</p>
<p>The median age for patients hospitalized with H1N1 was 28, compared to 71 for people admitted for seasonal influenza or flu-related pneumonia. Among those sent to the ICU, the median age of H1N1 patients was the mid-40s, while seasonal flu patients in a typical year had a median age of 68.</p>
<p>There was a staggering difference in the median ages of those who died: the mid-50s for H1N1 and the mid-80s for those from complications of seasonal flu, the most common of which is pneumonia.</p>
<p>"So that's something about the patients that seems to be a bit different," Morris said.</p>
<p>"There's also something about the kinds of care they needed in hospital that seemed to be different."</p>
<p>The researchers found that a higher proportion of patients in hospital for H1N1 were admitted to an intensive care unit - almost one in six compared with about one in 10 of those with seasonal flu.</p>
<p>And when it came to the proportion of patients who needed a ventilator to assist breathing, H1N1 patients were more than twice as likely to require the machines.</p>
<p>"We also know that H1N1 appears to have had a greater impact on some subgroups of the population - like pregnant women - than what we'd expected in a typical year," Morris said.</p>
<p>The study found the proportion of pregnant women hospitalized with H1N1 was higher than what would be expected in a typical flu year - 21 per cent versus 13 per cent. Four of the pregnant women with H1N1 died, she said. "And when we looked in all of 2007-8, there were no deaths among women hospitalized with flu or pneumonia."</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam said that while there are no big surprises in the report, it provides another perspective.</p>
<p>"Most people with it did have mild symptoms, but it really points out that actually there were a substantial number of people who were quite sick who ended up ventilated," said Gardam, head of infection prevention and control for Toronto's University Health Network.</p>
<p>"It just reinforces how lucky we were, that had this virus had a little bit more of the right stuff, we could have been in really big trouble."</p>
<p>Gardam believes we've seen the end of the H1N1 influenza pandemic because such a high proportion of Canadians has either been infected with the virus or been vaccinated against it.</p>
<p>"It becomes very difficult for the virus to take off ... You're still going to get cases, but you're not going to get those big peaks like we had in the first and second wave because there simply is not enough fuel."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu season boosts Shoppers' earnings</b>
</div><div>Hollie Shaw   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>469 words</div><div>12 February 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Runny noses and high fevers helped boost the bottom line at <span class="companylink">Shoppers Drug Mart Corp</span>., which saw fourth-quarter earnings climb seven per cent.</p>
<p>Canada's biggest pharmacy chain, with 1,291 stores, had 10 per cent more selling space in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago as it increased the size and number of its outlets across the country. The retail chain, which opened 114 stores last year, will add from 105 to 115 new outlets to its network this year and is predicting overall annual sales growth of six per cent to seven per cent.</p>
<p>"Last year we had a good year in front-of-store sales," improving market share in every single category, Jurgen Schreiber, chief executive of Shoppers, told a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p>Shoppers is trying to balance the effect of a heightened number of cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market against a growing business in high-end cosmetics and private-label goods. Its house brands include Bella, Quo, Life and the Nativa brand of organic packaged food.</p>
<p>Schreiber said consumers are still shopping a bit cautiously and responding favourably when items are put on sale.</p>
<p>"We do not see any sort of dramatic shift in consumer sentiment," he said.</p>
<p>Noting unemployment is still high, Schreiber vowed that promotional pricing would continue into 2010 to draw consumers.</p>
<p>Same-store sales, an important retail metric that looks at sales at stores open for a year or more, are expected to grow at four per cent to five per cent in the pharmacy in 2010, Shoppers executives said, and sales growth of merchandise in the front of the store of 2.75 per cent to 4.25 per cent.</p>
<p>Total market share in cosmetics in Canada is at 30 per cent, with a 40 per cent share of the prestige market, Schreiber said.</p>
<p>Net earnings rose to $171 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fiscal year ended Jan. 2, compared with $167 million, or 77 cents a share, a year ago. The retail chain also hiked its quarterly dividend by five per cent to 22.5 cents a share, payable April 15. Earnings were slightly below analysts' expectations; a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters was predicting earnings of 80 cents per share before items.</p>
<p>High awareness of the H1N1 virus helped fuel strong sales of over-the-counter medications, the retailer said. Sales were $2.5 billion in the quarter, which was 12 weeks, compared with a 13-week fiscal quarter in 2008. On a comparable 12-week basis, sales increased 7.1 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="companylink">Shoppers Drug Mart Corp</span>., said net earnings rose to $171 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fiscal year ended Jan. 2, compared with $167 million, or 77 cents a share, a year ago. The retail chain also hiked its quarterly dividend by five per cent to 22.5 cents a share, payable April 15. High awareness of the H1N1 virus helped fuel strong sales of over-the-counter medications, the retailer said.</p>

<p>H1N1 sends more people, and younger people, to hospital than the regular flu, according to a new study from the Canadian Institute for Health Information. The study found that, since the outbreak of H1N1 last April, the number of hospitalized H1N1 patients needing intensive care was 50 per cent higher than those with regular flu or pneumonia, the most common complication of seasonal flu. One in six H1N1 patients in hospital were admitted to the ICU, the study found. Of those admitted to hospital, one in 10 patients needed ventilation to help them breathe. That's more than double the number of seasonal flu or pneumonia patients requiring ventilation.</p>

<p>All is quiet on the Manitoba flu front.</p>
<p>The second wave of H1N1 flu has quietly come to an end, and so far there have been no signs of seasonal influenza in the province, according to Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>Whether there will be a third wave of H1N1 is anybody's guess, he said, but provincial officials are certainly not ruling it out. "I think it's still a bit of a guessing game as to what this pandemic H1N1 is going to do in the future," Kettner said Thursday.</p>
<p>Although the seasonal flu has yet to take hold this year -- as it usually does by now -- it's much too early to say Manitobans have dodged a bullet, Kettner said.</p>
<p>Seasonal flu viruses could still raise their ugly heads between now and April. "It could be a quieter-than-average year for other flu types, but I think it's too early to say that," he said.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus may have supplanted the seasonal flu strains this year, but no one knows for sure. "It's also very common to see two or three different types of viruses circulating in a winter season," Kettner pointed out.</p>
<p>Over the last four weeks, there has only been one new confirmed new case of H1N1 flu in Manitoba. Fewer than two dozen new cases have been recorded since the end of last year.</p>
<p>The province has hundreds of thousands of doses of H1N1 flu vaccine it may never use. Health officials have considered -- in conjunction with national authorities -- selling or donating the vaccine to other countries that may need it.</p>
<p>A lot depends on whether health authorities decide to incorporate H1N1 protection in next year's seasonal flu shot. If that happens, there will be less need for a continued stockpile of H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Health officials are also unsure how long the H1N1 vaccine will protect those who have received it. Nor are they sure of its shelf life, although it's believed the stocks on hand will be "very usable and effective for next flu season," Kettner said.</p>
<p>If protection is wearing off and everybody who got the H1N1 shot last time wants it again, Manitoba will use up all its supplies, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority continues to provide H1N1 vaccination clinics. The schedule is available on the health authority's website (at www.wrha.mb.ca/healthinfo/a-z/influenza/clinics.php[http://www.wrha.mb.ca/healthinfo/a-z/influenza/clinics.php]).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Winnipeggers can get an H1N1 shot at the Isaac Brock Community Centre, 715 Telfer St., from 2 to 6 p.m. or at Seven Oaks Health & Social Services Centre, 3-1050 Leila Ave., from 4 to 8 p.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WSD employees keep pay for blizzard day - No one loses cash for calling in sick</b>
</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>
<div>492 words</div><div>12 February 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>NO employee of Winnipeg School Division has been docked pay for taking a snow day Jan. 25 -- yet.</p>
<p>"We're still going through the cases one by one. Nobody's been deducted a day's pay, so far," school board chairwoman Jackie Sneesby said Thursday. "The ones up-to-date haven't had any money deducted -- that doesn't mean all of them aren't going to be deducted.''</p>
<p>But Winnipeg Teachers Association president Dave Najduch is far more optimistic.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, this issue is over," Najduch said Thursday. Wednesday was the final day for employees to file their documentation for calling in sick on the day of the blizzard, he said.</p>
<p>Najduch said the division demanded doctor's notes from 204 teachers who called in sick that day.</p>
<p>"It would be my guess they've gone through many of them, if not most of them," he said.</p>
<p>The other major employee group, Local 110 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, has not had anyone docked pay so far among the 25 members whom the division required to file letters, chief shop steward Fred Lake said.</p>
<p>The division won't tell the union how many absentee members it's cleared so far, Lake said. "As of today, no one has been deducted," he said.</p>
<p>Najduch said the WTA told its members that if they couldn't get a doctor's note for Jan. 25 -- the division demanded the notes eight days after the snow day -- that they should document their efforts to get a note, and file whatever they had to their school's principal.</p>
<p>Some teachers were sent home that day because they were sick, and some worked part of the day and had medical appointments already set up, Najduch said.</p>
<p>Teachers are disappointed and disillusioned by the way WSD treated them over Jan. 25, he said.</p>
<p>During the recent H1N1 pandemic, Najduch said, the policy was clear: If you're sick, stay home.</p>
<p>Najduch pointed out repeatedly that the 824 people who called in sick that day included all division employees -- and not just teachers.</p>
<p>There were 824 employees who called in sick on the day of the Jan. 25 blizzard, four times the usual number of sick absentees. Najduch did not know how many teachers had been sick Jan. 25, but who did not receive a letter from the division.</p>
<p>The division will not release specific figures concerning how many letters it served, and to whom.</p>
<p>"We have the right to do this under the contract," said Sneesby, who said last week that some WSD employees were "lying" and "dishonest," calling in sick because they couldn't get to work.</p>
<p>"They sign a contract saying they'll get to their jobs," Sneesby said.</p>
<p>"If there's an extraordinary number again, we'll do it again."</p>

<p>Contrary to urban myth and the Republican Tea Party, Bill Maher loves America. It's the people running America that make him see red.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Maher has made a career out of railing against the American political machine – be it Bush or Obama at the helm – and rarely holds back his vitriol toward organized religion, the war against terror, marijuana laws and, oddly enough, the H1N1 flu shot. Or consider the recent debate in the U.S. regarding a public option for health care.</p>
<p>“It's all so ridiculous,” Maher says on a recent stop in Toronto.</p>
<p>“It's called option – it's just an option. And yet there were people protesting in the streets and in town halls: ‘We're Americans! We're the people of liberty and we demand fewer choices!' What was that about?”</p>
<p>Conversely, ask Maher his opinion of Canada and he's happier than an American handed free health care for life.</p>
<p>“I love Canada and Canadians because they like me, and we think alike,” he says. “Let's face it, America is not the wisest country in the world and my sensibility is not the mainstream American sensibility. I just think Canada has a more sophisticated populace. It's more liberal. They get me here.”</p>
<p>The great provocateur returns to his standup roots in the special Bill Maher: But I'm Not Wrong (Saturday, HBO Canada at 10 p.m.).</p>
<p>Broadcast live from the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium in North Carolina, the hour-long special is expected to feature Maher expounding on a typically topical range of subjects, including fake patriotism, Iraq and Afghanistan, the death of Michael Jackson and why Obama needs a posse instead of the secret service. The fact that Maher hasn't stepped into the standup spotlight since his 2007 HBO special The Decider doesn't concern him in the least.</p>
<p>“It's not like doing standup comedy is something you forget,” says Maher, who recently turned 54. “I was doing standup when I started Politically Incorrect in 1993 and it's still one of my first loves. There's still no better forum for getting your point across to a large group of people.”</p>
<p>Running from 1993 to 2002, Politically Incorrect was the vehicle that established Maher's contrarian rep. The format was simple and brilliant: Four guests from the fields of showbiz, politics and pop culture sitting in chairs opposite each other, debating the issues of the day, with Maher in the middle as host and referee. Maher himself described the concept as “The McLaughlin Group on acid.”</p>
<p>Not for the first time, Maher's mouth got him into trouble. In the wake of 9/11, Maher took the devil's-advocate stance regarding America's position in the then-new war on terror.</p>
<p>“We have been the cowards, lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly,” Maher said on one broadcast.</p>
<p>Several advertisers pulled their ads and some affiliates stopped airing the show. Soon after, ABC pulled the plug on Politically Incorrect.</p>
<p>“While it lasted, it was a great show and of its time,” says Maher. “That time just ended a little early.”</p>
<p>ABC's loss was cable's gain. One year later, HBO launched Real Time with Bill Maher – back for its eighth season next Friday night – which was more or less the same show as Politically Incorrect, without the network censors and with more eclectic guests.</p>
<p>One memorable Real Time show from last September featured filmmaker Michael Moore, economist Paul Krugman, film director John Waters and disgraced ex-governor Eliot Spitzer in a panel discussion focusing on gay marriage, marijuana reform and the housing market, among other topics.</p>
<p>“It's not a talking-points show, it's a talking show,” insists Maher.</p>
<p>“In the early seasons we felt a need to have this pronounced ideological disparity each week, but at some point I decided we weren't going to book another conservative to rehash old theories about how Saddam Hussein was in league with Al Qaeda. We're past that. It's old.”</p>
<p>Toward the same contrarian cause, Maher wrote and starred in the 2008 documentary Religulous, which deconstructed organized religion. The film stirred up controversy in the U.S. Bible belt and turned a tidy profit for its makers.</p>
<p>All of this appears to greatly amuse Maher, who entered show business to become an actor and whose resume includes two appearances on Murder, She Wrote (playing two different characters). Like every good American, Maher realizes he never really had a choice on his evolution to TV punditry.</p>
<p>“America itself is a very conformist country,” he says reflectively.</p>
<p>“George Carlin once had a wonderful routine about how people in America think they have all these choices. Sure, we have 28 flavours of ice cream, but there are only two political parties, and they're way too much alike.</p>
<p>Americans don't really have any choices.”</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Also airing</p>
<p>Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony (CTV, TSN, CFMT,</p>
<p>7 p.m.; NBC, 7:30 p.m.)</p>
<p>Finally, it begins. The Vancouver Winter Games get off the ground with the customary opening ceremony, always a grandly overblown affair. The setting for tonight's live broadcast is B.C. Place, which has a capacity of 60,000. All told, more than 4,500 athletes, dancers and performers from around the world will appear in the mega-budget show. Expect the TV coverage to focus on faces in the crowd, which are expected to include U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, astronaut Buzz Aldrin and George Clooney.</p>
<p>The Wild Chef (Food Network, 8 p.m.)</p>
<p>Montreal Restaurateur Martin Picard is the lively tour guide of this road-trip series that rolls through Quebec in search of unique food experiences. The proprietor of the Montreal restaurant Au Pied de Cochon, Picard is most often accompanied by his sous-chef Hugue Dufour on his culinary journeys. Tonight, the unkempt cooks fly off to the northernmost corner of la belle province. Once landed, they hop on snowmobiles to explore the Arctic landscape, where they also take time out to cook up fresh mussels and render some seal blubber. Bonne appétit.</p>

</p>
<p>While the H1N1 virus sent a lot more people to Saskatchewan hospitals than a typical flu season does, the health-care system was prepared for the rush.</p>
<p>Since the H1N1 virus started appearing in Saskatchewan last year, 52 people have been admitted to intensive-care units in the province because of the virus and 15 have died.</p>
<p>But Dr. Saqib Shahab, deputy medical health officer for Saskatchewan Health, said Thursday that lessons learned during the SARS outbreak in Ontario in 2003 helped health regions deal with the higher-than-normal flu hospitalizations and to expect a different face for the typical patient. The average age of H1N1 patients was much lower than seasonal flu patients in other years.</p>
<p>"You really need to keep addressing other needs at the same time," said Shahab. "We did a really good job of predicting what our needs would be and responding to them."</p>
<p>Seeing how many more people were affected by H1N1 than the seasonal flu showed Shahab that the steps taken by the ministry -- including an early order of the H1N1 vaccine, making the antiviral drug Tamiflu available and a widespread awareness campaign -- were the correct ones.</p>
<p>"It doesn't take six months or a year for pandemics to travel the globe; it takes days or weeks," said Shahab.</p>
<p>The trend that those in the health field in Saskatchewan saw during the past nine months mirrored what was happening in the rest of the country, says a study released Thursday by the Canadian Institute for Health Information.</p>
<p>The report looked at intensive-care admissions, ventilations required and in-hospital death rates for influenza pneumonia and influenza-only patients in a typical year (2007-08 in this case) compared with those for H1N1 patients from April 12 to Jan. 2.</p>
<p>Across Canada, of all patients who entered the hospital with influenza pneumonia, 11 per cent were admitted to the ICU while seven per cent of influenza-only patients were ICU patients. Of all H1N1 patients in hospitals, 17 per cent entered the ICU.</p>
<p>The study also concluded a higher percentage of H1N1 patients had to be put on ventilators but a lower percentage (five per cent compared to nine per cent) died than did those with influenza pneumonia.</p>

</p>
<p>Capital Councillor Clive Doucet told council on Wednesday that he wants an apology from College Councillor Rick Chiarelli, alleging Chiarelli implied while speaking on CFRA that Doucet tried to sell Lansdowne Park and was "misusing" his authority as a member of council. Doucet recently sent a letter to the National Capital Commission asking it to buy the city-owned site so that it remains public space. The NCC said it wasn't interested. Doucet said Chiarelli's comments misled the public. Doucet said he wrote to the NCC as a citizen, not on behalf of council. "It was a personal political statement about the history and future of the park, not an MLS listing," Doucet said, adding that Chiarelli's comments border on "slanderous" because they implied that Doucet doesn't understand basic council procedure for selling a city-owned property. Mayor Larry O'Brien asked staff to get a transcript of Chiarelli's comments before he rules on the issue during council's next meeting.</p>
<p>Council backs Senators' 2012 NHL all-star bid</p>
<p>Council has thrown its support behind an Ottawa Senators attempt to land the 2012 NHL all-star game. The Senators are bidding to play host to the all-star weekend, which is to take place Jan. 26 to 29, 2012. The corporate services and economic development committee recommended the city provide up to $200,000 in cash and in-kind services, such as police escorts and VIP access to the Transitway, to subsidize a "pageantry program." City staff has been directed to report back to the corporate services committee on "any significant funding needs" beyond the current contribution.</p>
<p>Orléans roundabout gets the go-ahead</p>
<p>A multi-lane roundabout was approved by council today for the intersection at St. Joseph and Jeanne D'Arc boulevards in Orléans. Councillors Rob Jellett, Michel Bellemare and Bob Monette, whose ward borders on the intersection, dissented. The roundabout will cost $1.7 million and must be complete by March 2011 to qualify for federal stimulus money that the city plans to use for the project.</p>
<p>Ottawa group names Levy physician of the year</p>
<p>A group representing Ottawa doctors has named the city's top public health official its physician of the year. Dr. Isra Levy was given the award by the Academy of Medicine Ottawa "in recognition of his demonstrated excellence as a clinician, advocate and for his outstanding service to the community," according to a news release from the city. Levy, who has been the head of the city's public-health unit since May 2008, was the point man on the city's response to the H1N1 swine flu, marshalling hundreds of workers to run seven-day-a-week vaccination clinics in the autumn. Efforts to convince people to get vaccinated were so successful that the clinics initially had lines hundreds of people deep and hours long. The pressure was alleviated somewhat when the city introduced a wristband system that meant people could register, then return later for their shot.</p>
<p>Madeleine Meilleur Pte. gets shortened name</p>
<p>Residents of Madeleine Meilleur Private should be a bit happier after council agreed Wednesday to shorten the road's name to simply Meilleur Private. Residents had complained the road's name -- Privé Madeleine Meilleur Private, in both official languages -- was too long. Some also complained it was wrong to name a street after a sitting politician. Meilleur, a former city and regional councillor, is MPP of Ottawa-Vanier and a minister in the provincial government. Rideau-Vanier Councillor Georges Bédard presented a motion to council that was dealt with quickly for "addressing purposes," since there are already new homes on the road, which is in a Claridge development off the Vanier Parkway.</p>

<p>The total cost of treating and vaccinating Albertans against the H1N1 flu was $148 million this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The price tag was revealed in Tuesday's update of the current fiscal year, which was released with the newest provincial budget.</p>
<p>Swine flu vaccines cost the province $10 million, while the $138 million costs of paying physicians, treating patients and other H1N1 response fell under the government's definition of "disaster" or "emergency assistance."</p>
<p>The new dollar figure attached to H1N1 was just one highlight of the fiscal update for the third quarter of the 2009-10 budget year.</p>
<p>Thanks to an increase in provincial revenues, the government now expects a deficit of $3.6 billion for 2009-10, down from the $4.7 billion deficit outlined last spring when the budget was first introduced.</p>
<p>Revenues were boosted by higher-than-expected oil and oilsands royalties, more corporate income tax revenue, and an increase in health and social transfers from the federal government. Personal income tax and natural gas royalty revenues were down.</p>

<p>Swine flu vaccines cost the province $10 million, while the $138 million costs of paying physicians, treating patients and other H1N1 response fell under the government's definition of "disaster" or "emergency assistance."</p>
<p>Auditor General Fred Dunn has said he planned to investigate the province's pandemic flu program to determine whether the vaccination program was rolled out effectively.</p>
<p>The new dollar figure attached to H1N1 was just one highlight of the fiscal update for the third quarter of the 2009-10 budget year.</p>
<p>Thanks to an increase in provincial revenues, the province now expects a deficit of $3.6 billion for 2009-10, down from the $4.7 billion deficit outlined last spring when the budget was first introduced.</p>
<p>Revenues were boosted by higher-than-expected oil and oilsands royalties, more corporate income tax revenue, and an increase in health and social transfers from Ottawa. Personal income tax and natural gas royalty revenues were down.</p>
<p>The province also saved money on a handful of capital projects, such as highways or schools, because of the "re-costing" ushered in by the overall economic slowdown.</p>

<p>HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND</p>
<p>$13.8 billion -- Current estimated worth</p>

<p>$14.8 billion -- March 2006</p>
<p>BY THE NUMBERS</p>
<p>- - $3.6 billion -Alberta's estimated deficit by the end of the 2009-10 fiscal year. The projected deficit is lower than the $4.7 billion the government laid out last spring.</p>
<p>- - $13.8 billion -The estimated worth of the Heritage Savings Trust Fund by the end of the 2009-10 fiscal year. Government members often refer to the heritage fund as the province's RRSP, a savings account that won't be touched. Since 1982, however, more than $30 billion has been shifted from the fund's income to the province's general revenues.</p>
<p>- - $15 billion -The estimated worth of the Sustainability Fund by the end of the fiscal year. This is higher than was anticipated last spring, but the government plans to dip into this "rainy day" fund to cover shortfalls this year and next. By today's estimates, the Sustainability Fund would be worth just $2.8 billion in 2012-13.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ensuring safety of all foodstuffs an Olympic task; 'Kitchen nanny' wirelessly monitors temperatures in walk-in fridges, open coolers and salad bars</b>
</div><div>Susan Sampson   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>618 words</div><div>10 February 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>A Newmarket company is part of a big operation to prevent food poisoning at the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>"Athletes need to fuel their bodies," says Tim Osland of Thermor Ltd. "If they're not feeling their best, they will not get that gold medal."</p>
<p>Osland recently returned from the Vancouver and Whistler Olympic Villages, where his company's wireless temperature monitoring system was installed in walk-in fridges, open coolers and salad bars in kitchens and cafeterias.</p>
<p>The system is formally called the BIOS Professional Wireless Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points Temperature Manager. But you can call it the "kitchen nanny," says Osland, Thermor's director of sales for food service and health care.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of the pet name for it because fridge doors are left open far too often in the kitchen," he says. The nanny, he adds, provides a "constant nagging reminder to break that bad habit."</p>
<p>Instead of staff running around with clipboards and thermometers, sensors transmit data to a computer spreadsheet. If temperatures fall into the danger zone, a red light flashes and a beeper sounds.</p>
<p>Bacteria proliferate most quickly in the danger zone between 40F and 140F (4C to 60C). Keeping hot foods hot and cold foods cold is crucial to food safety.</p>
<p>There was a wake-up call in China in 2008 when an estimated 22 members of the U.S. track team were struck by suspected food poisoning at a pre-Olympic training centre near Beijing just before they were due to compete. The cause was not pinpointed.</p>
<p>During the Games, Chinese officials used both high- and low-tech measures to monitor food safety. White mice, for instance, were pressed into service as food tasters - potentially offering faster results than lab tests.</p>
<p>"We're not going that far," says Domenic Losito, regional director of health protection at Vancouver Coastal Health. "We have a fairly safe food supply system in Canada already."</p>
<p>He says a variety of measures are being taken to prevent food poisoning at athletes' villages, media centres, sporting venues and even "outside the fence" in restaurants and at so-called "celebration sites."</p>
<p>"You don't want that to spoil the memories of the Games," Losito says.</p>
<p>The health authority's 75 field officers are conducting two sweeps - one before the Games and now underway, the other halfway through the Games. Also, food service facilities will be inspected over 18 hours a day, since some events, such as hockey, run to midnight. Food handlers are expected to wash their hands frequently, particularly since it's still H1N1 flu season.</p>
<p>The food being checked ranges from packaged chips to buffet meals, eaten by anyone from athletes to maintenance workers, tourists to reporters. Losito says higher-risk foods, ranging from sushi to luncheon meats, will be scrutinized more closely. Each village alone is expected to serve 6,000 meals a day.</p>
<p>"We will be doing a fair bit of picking up samples and running them through the lab," he says, referring to the BC Centre For Disease Control laboratory.</p>
<p>Inspectors have completed a blitz of "non-Games restaurants" in the Vancouver area. Losito says they also have to deal with 50-plus "celebration sites" run by cultural organizations or commercial sponsors. He notes that more than half the countries represented at the Games set up houses and arenas to welcome the public. Celebrations, of course, include food and drink.</p>
<p>"The organizing committee wanted to be reassured when guests come that food is safe to consume outside the fence," Losito says.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Deficit math could haunt Stelmach</b>
</div><div>Don Braid   </div>

</p>
<p>Faced with Wildrose Alliance allegations of billions in hidden deficit, Treasury Board president Lloyd Snelgrove snaps: "the people who can do math didn't cross the floor."</p>
<p>That's our Lloyd, the quickest wit in the Tory cabinet. Asked last fall if he'd had an H1N1 flu shot, he quipped, "no, our job is to stay in the legislature and be needled by pricks, not go out and be pricked by needles."</p>
<p>A little humour in politics never hurt anyone, as far as we know. But in the deficit debate, Snelgrove's answer is a lot funnier than the allegation.</p>
<p>Wildrose MLA Rob Anderson insists the true deficit will be $8.4 billion for the year ending March 31, and between $6.5 billion and $8 billion for budget 2010-11.</p>
<p>We'll know more when official numbers come out today, but the quarrel will continue because there's a basic difference over the math.</p>
<p>Anderson notes, correctly, that the health-care deficit now running at more than $1.1 billion is not included in deficit calculations.</p>
<p>He asks -- why not? The government is responsible for the health board shortfall. Nobody else will pay it off.</p>
<p>Anderson says that if health care were added to this year's estimate of $4.3 billion, the deficit would immediately jump to $5.4 billion.</p>
<p>Tack on $3 billion more for infrastructure spending, he adds, and the deficit hits $8.4 billion.</p>
<p>The Tory deficit also excludes infrastructure, on the theory that the value of the asset offsets the spending.</p>
<p>Anderson doesn't think that makes sense, no matter what the government accountants say.</p>
<p>"What are they going to do -- sell a bridge? Sell Highway 2?</p>
<p>"That's real money being spent. The fact is, the province will spend $8.4 billion more this year than it takes in."</p>
<p>Anderson, remember, was briefly on Snelgrove's own Treasury Board before he crossed the floor to the Wildrose.</p>
<p>Since he's still bound by confidentiality, he bases his deficit arguments on published information.</p>
<p>He writes in his blog: "It appears, from what has been publicly disclosed thus far, that Budget 2010 will ring in with a true cash deficit of somewhere between $6.5 billion and $8 billion."</p>
<p>Snelgrove, meanwhile, thinks Anderson left his ability to count on the Treasury Board table.</p>
<p>Tories got even angrier at Anderson on Monday when he charged them with doing more harm to Alberta than anybody since Pierre Trudeau.</p>
<p>On the deficit issue he doesn't exactly accuse the Tories of lying, just that "they're using accounting principles to their own advantage."</p>
<p>Not only is the true deficit much higher than people believe, he says, but debt is approaching $3 billion.</p>
<p>If the Wildrose view is accepted by voters, it could quickly throw Premier Ed Stelmach's agenda into further confusion.</p>
<p>The premier knows cuts must be made, but vows to protect core services. He's said many times he won't rip the government or programs apart because of a temporary recession.</p>
<p>It's a humane approach, but if the government is really masking deficit numbers, it could catch a serious case of the Getty disease.</p>
<p>Former premier Don Getty's government kept spending generously while tucking deficit numbers away in odd corners of the budget.</p>
<p>After Ralph Klein took over, his financial review panel said that had to stop. All obligations were to be clearly shown.</p>
<p>For many years, they were, and Stelmach was part of the group that made it happen.</p>
<p>If he's sliding back into the old ways now, his real troubles are yet to come.</p>

reality, with the true tally much higher than what we're told.   </p>

<p>Fifteen scientists at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute have been awarded a total of $7.8 million in federal research grants. The funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research will support research on ways to manage cholesterol, blood clots, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, HIV, strokes and diabetes. "These research projects will help us develop better therapies, answer important health questions and make our health care system more effective and efficient," said Dr. Duncan Stewart, chief executive of the institute. A portion of the funding will support Stewart's own research into the role of stem cells in preventing severe flu-related complications, particularly inflammation of the lungs, which is the main cause of death in people infected with H1N1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Slump, flu, visas prompt AeroMexico to withdraw from Canada</b>
</div><div>BRENT JANG    </div>
<div>566 words</div><div>9 February 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p>AeroMexico is dropping Canada barely a year after introducing its service, a sign of tough times for the Canadian tourism sector.</p>
<p>The Mexico City-based carrier started serving Toronto last March and Montreal last April, but suspended scheduled flights to and from Quebec's largest city in January. AeroMexico's computer reservation system now shows Toronto will be scratched from its network after a final flight on March 24.</p>
<p>William Clark, a Toronto-based aviation lawyer who represents AeroMexico, said in an interview yesterday that the airline has given notice to the Canadian Transportation Agency of the termination of scheduled service to and from Canada.</p>
<p>While the global recession and the H1N1 influenza outbreak hampered Canada's tourism industry last year, the Canadian government's requirement that Mexicans obtain visas to visit Canada, effective last July, hurt AeroMexico just as it sought to establish its new service, industry observers say.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada reports that there were 3,743 visitors from Mexico entering Canada in November, 2009, or a drop of 62.3 per cent from the same month in 2008. The Canadian Tourism Commission warned in a newsletter that trips from Mexico have been “still influenced by the new visa requirements for travellers to Canada.”</p>
<p>In first 11 months of 2009, there were 161,399 inbound visitors from Mexico, down 34.9 per cent from the year-earlier period. Mexico registered a sharp decline in January-to-November visitors to Canada last year, with 86,343 fewer travellers than in the same period in 2008.</p>
<p>In November, the total number of international visitors to Canada fell 11.3 per cent to 722,667, according to Statscan data that underscore the slump in inbound tourism. In the first 11 months of 2009, the total slid 7.9 per cent to 14.8 million travellers.</p>
<p>After Mexico, the sharpest percentage drops in the January-November period were overnight trips from Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil.</p>
<p>The March withdrawal of AeroMexico will leave Mexicana, Air Canada and <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. to continue serving Canada-Mexico routes with their scheduled flights. There are also a variety of tour operators and charter and regional carriers.</p>
<p>Mexicana recently scaled back its Canadian service, cancelling its non-stop flights to and from Edmonton.</p>
<p>WestJet and Air Canada target Canadian vacationers seeking to escape to a variety of spots in Mexico, and their passenger loads this winter haven't suffered like those of the Mexico-based carriers, which rely much more on Mexican traffic, said Brad Miron, vice-president of business development at holiday retailer itravel2000.</p>
<p>Last April, Canadian tour operators and airlines temporarily cancelled trips to Mexico amid that country's H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>But this winter, buoyed by the strong loonie, bookings to sun destinations are expected to improve, said Mr. Miron, who added that some Canadian travellers have switched to Mexico and away from the Dominican Republic after the Jan. 12 earthquake in neighbouring Haiti.</p>

<p>Port-au-Prince -- Angelina Jolie is on her way.</p>
<p>I'm not going to write about that.</p>
<p>Sean Penn, who reportedly looks like a camp rat and is still bunking in with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division, is rumoured to be leaving Wednesday but will return shortly.</p>
<p>I'm not going to write about that.</p>
<p>What I am going to write about is Cite Soleil and how the story behind it sits at the epicentre of Haiti's hope of reinventing itself four weeks after the Jan. 12 earthquake refocused the eyes of the world upon her.</p>
<p>In the eyes of that same world, Cite Soleil is infamous for being the most squalid slum in the Western Hemisphere more than four decades after Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier started shipping people to what was, initially, Cite Simone Duvalier, named after his wife.</p>
<p>Should she be alive today, the haughty and powerful mate of the corrupt and murderous dictator would have a difficult time joining me on this walk along the fetid gulley past the dogs, the garbage and the defecating children. She would not be able to breathe the air.</p>
<p>On one side of the gulley the neighbourhood rolls out on an endless barren landscape under the hot white sun. Divided into zones, the community has the despairing air of a war-torn refugee camp.</p>
<p>On the other side of the gulley, a tent city has sprung up in Parc Fierte, an even more barren landscape that now houses the wretched who have been displaced from nothing to less than nothing.</p>
<p>Joseph Odiles has moved from one side of the gulley, which in the horrid terms of the moment would be the better side, to the other.</p>
<p>He has been living in Cite Soleil for 38 years. He's 53.</p>
<p>He sits on a concrete riser outside of what he now calls his home. Spread beyond him, the predictable scene emerges. Tent after tent after tent crafted out of sticks of wood - God knows where it came from as the area is all but denuded - draped in sheets and blankets and, extremely rarely, a tarp. Odiles's own home: a patch of grass, a machete, a stool.</p>
<p>Odiles scrapes a few gourdes together by selling shots of alcohol and Comme Il Faut cigarettes. Before the earthquake he had no job and no hope of one. In the years he has lived in the cite he has fathered 10 children.</p>
<p>Today he has no job, no hope of one, and still has children to feed. Altagrace was hit on the head the day of the earthquake, Odiles says of his 7-year-old daughter. A niece and nephew perished. Odiles was no longer living with his wife at the time of the earthquake.</p>
<p>Odiles was born in Les Cayes, which kisses the Caribbean Sea on the southern side of the island.</p>
<p>His memories are rich with the historic agricultural lushness of the country. Coffee and arable land; Creole pigs and plentiful domestic rice. Then Haiti was flooded with cheaper rice and the pigs were slaughtered (swine flu) and the country was deforested and there wasn't much left, as Odiles's life for the past 38 years attests.</p>
<p>"It was all destroyed," he says of his beautiful country.</p>
<p>And now this.</p>
<p>A man opens his shirt to display a pussing, oozing chest. A young woman holds out her grotesquely swollen foot and says the slight treatment has had no effect.</p>
<p>Pastor Franck Jean holds out the box of supplies he has been given as medical aid: surgical gloves, Hannah Montana tattoo bandages, syringes.</p>
<p>Esther Nelson gave birth nine days ago. She has seen no doctor, no nurse, and when it rains the water comes through her sheet-for-a-roof.</p>
<p>The AVSI (Association of Volunteers in International Service) tents are spanking new and empty. The 5,000-litre water bladder is empty. (I return a day later to check on affairs: the water bladder is full; the tents are still empty. The women tell me they sell their food coupons for cash.)</p>
<p>Back across the gully, the streets of Cite Soleil are now more impoverished and more broken down.</p>
<p>I take a picture of a cop in big sunglasses and big boots who looks like he just stepped out of an Xbox game. Rousting a young man, looking for drugs, that was my take on the scene.</p>
<p>The policeman is angry.</p>
<p>"Delete that picture. Delete that picture," he barks, jabbing at my camera.</p>
<p>So I can't show you that picture. But I can tell you the story in words.</p>

</p>
<p>Alpine skier Ryan Semple has done an awful lot of uphill slogging over the past four years for the privilege of going downhill quickly, although rarely fast enough.</p>
<p>He's had to overcome two out-of-country hip surgeries and removal from the Canadian ski team -- and then battle his way back onto the World Cup scene and national squad, all the while convincing sponsors to prop up his athletic career.</p>
<p>So maybe it's time the Ottawa technical racer got to enjoy himself. He's hoping it will happen in Whistler, B.C., during his second trip to the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Semple, 27, certainly has momentum heading into the Games as he prepares for the men's super-combined race, one part downhill and one part slalom. (He also is the alternate with teammate Patrick Biggs of Gloucester in men's slalom.)</p>
<p>By finishing a World Cup career-best 11th in the super combined last month in Kitzbuhel, Austria, Semple improved his world ranking to 28th. He should earn a good start number for his Olympic downhill race.</p>
<p>Racing on the most treacherous downhill course in the world, Semple was 50th at Kitzbuhel. But a seventh-place effort in the slalom gave him 11th place overall.</p>
<p>"I'm stronger in the downhill now," says Semple, who didn't get a result in the super combined at the 2006 Olympics after he hooked a gate in the slalom and didn't finish.</p>
<p>"I'm (racing) downhill with confidence and I'm looking for speed.</p>
<p>"In the slalom, I'm much improved. I'm hoping for a fresher course so I can be quicker."</p>
<p>Semple also was aiming to race slalom at the Olympics. But when you can't put together back-to-back runs, then you don't get a result. In his 20 World Cup slaloms since the 2006 Olympics, including eight this season, he hasn't posted a single result.</p>
<p>In 36 career World Cup slaloms, he only has had three finishes, but they were impressive and all within a seven-week period in 2004-05.</p>
<p>While Semple has made a breakthrough in the super combined and is only a few tenths of a second from doing the same in slalom and reviving his hot streak of five years ago, the road back has been rough, filled with surgery, frustration and sleepless nights.</p>
<p>Shortly after his 2006 Olympic experience in Turin, where he didn't complete either the super combined or giant slalom, Semple began to develop hip problems.</p>
<p>He lived with the pain and struggled through the 2006-07 season, until finally having labrum surgery on his left hip area in April 2007. The labrum is a ring of cartilage surrounding the socket of the hip joint.</p>
<p>"It was general wear and tear," he explains. "It was very small and subtle. I thought nothing of it. No one could pinpoint it."</p>
<p>That type of surgery is not often performed in Canada, so he went to Colorado for the procedure, which was covered by OHIP. He was on crutches for seven weeks and didn't ski until September.</p>
<p>Early in the 2007-08 season, he felt pain in the same hip. It limited his range of motion, and he competed in only five World Cup races before shutting down his season and returning home.</p>
<p>"The doctors weren't sure what was wrong," he says. "There was a lot of pain and restricted movement."</p>
<p>While he raced the Canadian championships men's slalom and two Nor-Ams two months later to try to improve his ranking for the 2008-09 season, he didn't apply for a national team medical bye to help keep his spot on the squad for 2008-09.</p>
<p>"The coaches weren't convinced I was injured," he says. "I didn't think it (letter) would change anything."</p>
<p>When the 2008-09 team was announced in the spring, Semple's name wasn't on the list.</p>
<p>"I was surprised," he says. "Any time anyone is hurt or coming back from injury, they're never kicked off the team. They're still part of the team or program."</p>
<p>Even so, Semple, by that point a seven-year team veteran, didn't appeal Alpine Canada's decision: "I hadn't met the criteria of the team. I'd be chasing a ghost."</p>
<p>But Semple didn't lose his fighting spirit. He decided to focus his comeback by racing on the North American-based Nor-Am Cup development circuit in 2008-09.</p>
<p>After a second hip surgery in Colorado in April 2008, to clean up some scar tissue, Semple trained in Chile with his former Mont Tremblant coach Conrad Guay and in Europe with World Cup skier Kilian Albrecht of Bulgaria.</p>
<p>He covered the costs with "pooled money from past seasons" and sponsorship funds from The Groupe Verdier.</p>
<p>On the slopes, he won five medals on the gruelling Nor-Am Cup circuit -- two gold, two silver and one bronze in slalom and super combined.</p>
<p>His last medal was the most important, a second-place result in a slalom in Lake Placid that put him second overall on the circuit in that discipline and gave him an automatic berth to race on the World Cup circuit this season.</p>
<p>He also was second overall in Nor-Am super combined, getting him a second World Cup berth.</p>
<p>"I wanted to focus on slalom because super combined meant training downhill ... super combined wasn't a priority," says Semple, who saw that plan shift 10 months later.</p>
<p>When Alpine Canada named its national team for 2009-10, Semple was recognized for his efforts the previous season. But he had to pay $30,000 to get full national team status.</p>
<p>Since he was older than 25 and was without a top-30 World Cup ranking in his discipline in 2008-09, he had to buy his way back onto the team.</p>
<p>Semple started a letter-writing campaign to finance his Olympic season, but it didn't come together until the last minute. In the end, Canderel, which is his headgear sponsor, Canadian Athletes Now Fund and The Groupe Verdier covered his costs.</p>
<p>"I was stressed like crazy," says Semple. "I was quite worried. I'm not sure if it affected my skiing, but I</p>
<p>didn't sleep well and my immune system was weakened.</p>
<p>"But after that (making the payments), I turned around my season and was skiing with no regrets.</p>
<p>"Last year and this year, everything came down to the wire and it could have gone either way. But it's a great feeling to have all the support and it's really exciting."</p>
<p>Now, he can enjoy his Olympics.</p>
<p>"I'll focus on the task at hand and be pleased with my result," he said.</p>

<p>But throughout her youth, she never became an alpine racer, going head to head against the clock. She was more interested in taking lessons to become a ski instructor and coach, reaching Level 3 in both, one step below a national rank.</p>
<p>"I always wanted to ski race, but ... I was too shy," she says. "At 13-14, I regretted not starting. In skiing, you need to start young."</p>
<p>In her late teens in the mid-'90s, she discovered snowboarding and, out of curiosity, borrowed a board from the Mont Ste. Marie rental shop.</p>
<p>She quickly embraced the sport as her winter love and at 22 became an better-late-than-never snowboard alpine racer.</p>
<p>"When I started snowboarding, I knew it's my opportunity to live the dream," she says.</p>
<p>Now 31, Calvé's decade of commitment and determination has made her an Olympian for the first time. She'll compete at the 2010 Winter Games in snowboarding's parallel</p>
<p>giant slalom, where two athletes go head-to-head down matching courses on two occasions to determine who advances to the next round.</p>
<p>In her seventh World Cup season, Calvé has moved into contention to be classified as a potential medal winner.</p>
<p>After an impressive 2008-09 season, during which she won her first World Cup medal, a silver, at Valmalenco, Italy, placed seventh at La Molina, Italy, and 11th at the world championships in Korea, Calvé has had two top-10 results this season in five World Cup meets.</p>
<p>After placing ninth in Telluride, Colorado, in December, she was seventh in her last race Jan. 24 in Stoneham, Que., finishing only one one-hundredth of a second from a solid chance of winning her second World Cup medal.</p>
<p>As Calvé focuses on having the perfect run each time, she's also thrilled she can experience her first Olympics with her boyfriend, Adam McLeish, a former Canadian team member who will represent Great Britain in men's parallel giant slalom.</p>
<p>McLeish, 30, has had 38 career World Cup races, but only scored his first top-10 result in December in Telluride with an eighth.</p>
<p>"I'm so happy," Calvé says. "It wouldn't be as good an experience if he didn't qualify or if he went and I didn't qualify."</p>
<p>When she's at the Olympics, Calvé hopes to recreate the feeling she had at Stoneham, her second-best-ever World Cup result.</p>
<p>"There was lot of stuff I did that worked. I plan to do the same, a lot of visualization and imagery," she explains.</p>
<p>"But the Olympics is a totally different experience. I'm aiming for the podium. I'll hope to be at the top of my game.</p>
<p>"For me, the Olympics is mental. The physical is not the issue. I have to be calm and see myself going through the course and being positive. It's a question of being prepared mentally."</p>
<p>Calvé's path to the podium</p>
<p>Feb. 26: Parallel giant slalom</p>
<p>Perianne Jones</p>
<p>If it wasn't for her parents acting quickly on their skis and feeding</p>
<p>her sweet treats, cross-country skier Perianne Jones of Almonte may not be anticipating her first Winter Olympic Games as an athlete.</p>
<p>"At the beginning, it wasn't my favourite," Jones said about her introduction to the nordic sport as a two-year-old. "I'd scream and yell."</p>
<p>But her parents, Judi and Brad Jones, found the solution to calm her down and ease her into cross-country skiing, which was going through a boom period in the late 1980s. "They fed me Smarties and hot chocolate," she laughs. "With my parents, I milked it. I couldn't be more unpleasant."</p>
<p>By the time she was five, Jones was involved in the introductory Jackrabbit ski program, mixing with children her own age and catching onto the sport at the Mississippi Cross-Country Ski Club in Carleton Place.</p>
<p>That experience ignited her love of cross-country skiing as she found success racing for the Nakkertok Ski Club, which is based in Cantley, Que., the Ontario ski team and the Canadian junior team for three years before joining the national senior team five years ago.</p>
<p>Unlike some athletes who went right down to the last month to make the criteria for Canada's 2010 Winter Olympic Games team, Jones qualified a year ago by placing sixth in the women's team sprint with Sara Renner of Canmore, Alta., at their 2009 world championships in Liberec, Czech Republic.</p>
<p>"I haven't done a ton or racing in the past month, just a lot of training and gearing up for February," says Jones in reference to the Olympics.</p>
<p>"We've planned these Olympics for quite a while and we're peaking as a team to race fast. I'm confident."</p>
<p>The priority race for Jones will be the women's classic-style 1.7-kilometre sprint, which goes Feb. 17, the day before she turns 25.</p>
<p>The classic-style is Jones's strength and she's aiming for a top-30 result in her first Winter Olympic Games. Canada won the gold medal in that discipline at the 2006 Turin Olympics, when Chandra Crawford of Canmore captured the sprint.</p>
<p>During the 2009 World Cup at Whistler, B.C., site of the 2010 Olympic races, Jones was 20th in the shorter 1.2-km classic-style sprint. She also hopes to compete in the women's 4x5-km relay, but is uncertain about longer individual races outside the sprint.</p>
<p>"I'm in a really good situation because the whole team is strong," she adds. "I was named to the team early and have had this incredible opportunity to learn from everyone (including Renner and Crawford)."</p>
<p>Jones also has received incredible support from her hometown of Almonte. "My motivation is the community," Jones says proudly.</p>
<p>Through a variety of fundraisers, Almonte residents presented $15,000 to Jones, who used it to travel to New Zealand for a summer training camp, massage treatments and food while living in Canmore, Alta.</p>
<p>"I am so lucky being from a supportive community."</p>

<p>John Morris</p>
<p>Days after his team missed qualifying for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, John Morris of Ottawa stood at life's crossroads.</p>
<p>As much as he enjoyed curling, he knew it wasn't going to be a well-paying full-time job. He considered pulling away from the sport on a full-time basis and pursuing a long-term career in another field.</p>
<p>Being a teacher or a firefighter always captured his imagination. Morris started the process by applying to teachers' college at Queen's University.</p>
<p>But shortly after he was accepted into the one-year program at Queen's, he was approached by curling skip Kevin Martin of Edmonton, who was rebuilding his team, after dismissing Don Walchuk, Carter Rycroft and Don Bartlett.</p>
<p>"As skip, I had gone hard for four years to the last Olympics and didn't make it," Morris, 31, said in an interview. "I was looking at other options."</p>
<p>Martin wanted Morris on his team to chase the Canadian men's Olympic berth at the 2010 curling trials in</p>
<p>Edmonton. The negotiations lasted a couple of months before Morris committed and put his teaching career on hold.</p>
<p>Morris joined newcomers Marc Kennedy, the second, and lead Ben Hebert. At the time, Martin was a two-time Canadian men's champion (1997 and 1991), a double Canada Cup champion and winner of 24 national curling events from 1992 to 2006.</p>
<p>Morris's gamble to stay with curling turns out to have been a wise move.</p>
<p>Since Martin, Morris, Kennedy and Hebert have been together, they have curled in the last two world championship finals, winning in 2008. They have also won two Canadian men's championships, captured 17 money bonspiel titles and 31 top-3 finishes in 41 events.</p>
<p>In December, Morris helped Martin achieve the team's main goal: winning the Olympic trials for the right to represent Canada at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, where they are among the favourites to win gold.</p>
<p>Along the way, Morris also has been able to pursue his other passion as a paid on-call firefighter for the fire and rescue unit in Chestermere, Alta. The job allows him work shifts to fit around his curling schedule.</p>
<p>Besides being on a talented rink of curlers, Morris figures the team's approach to fitness, game mechanics and work ethic have played a major role in its success.</p>
<p>"We worked extremely hard over the last three years. Our goal was to give the 2010 Olympics a good run. It's the hardest I ever worked," says Morris, who was inspired last year to write a book, Fit to Curl, to help all curlers improve their overall game through a fitness program.</p>
<p>"I worked hard in the off season. I never did that before 2006. I've come to learn from experience that you must train to get your maximum potential."</p>
<p>At the same time, Morris stressed developing sound skills on the ice in practice.</p>
<p>"We're big on mechanics. We make it consistent. We try to get our deliveries down so that they're the same for all of us," he explains.</p>
<p>"We're traditionalists. Kevin Martin (43) is an old-school guy. We try to break things down with hard work and blood, sweat and tears.</p>
<p>"Other teams look for gadgets and advances. But we keep it simple. There's nothing better than a good work ethic and a positive attitude."</p>
<p>Morris's path to the podium</p>
<p>Feb. 16: Canada vs. Norway, noon; Canada vs. Germany, 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Feb. 18: Canada vs. Sweden, noon; Canada vs. France, 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Robin Clegg</p>
<p>Dunrobin's Robin Clegg thought he knew how his final season of international biathlon racing was going to unfold.</p>
<p>He already understood the International Biathlon Union had allotted Canada only one berth for the men's individual races. That left him with one option for his third Winter Olympic Games: the men's 4x7.5-kilometre relay.</p>
<p>What Clegg, 32, didn't count on was getting the H1N1 flu last October.</p>
<p>"It snowballed from there," Clegg said, whose World Cup individual results this season had been forgettable until he was 23rd in the men's 20-kilometre race in Antholz-Anterselva, Italy, last month.</p>
<p>"I should have stopped, but I</p>
<p>didn't," he says. "I took a couple of days off. Then I trained. I got sick. I trained. I got sick."</p>
<p>Clegg, who represents the Chelsea Nordic club but lives in Edmonton, didn't respect the serious illness enough. As an athlete, he thought could stare it down.</p>
<p>"I figured I was older, tougher and invincible. But I was wrong," he admits.</p>
<p>"I took some time off, but I should have taken quite a bit more. It was a lot harder on me than I thought.</p>
<p>The side effects of the flu stayed with him for a couple of months, carrying into the start of the World Cup season.</p>
<p>Then there's the nagging injuries, which can especially irritate thirtysomething athletes and slow their progress.</p>
<p>"It was the same old stuff," he said in an interview from training in Mittenwald, Germany. "It's me getting older. I had no breaks, but it was tendon issues and stuff like that that slows you down."</p>
<p>While his shooting remains consistent, his skiing has struggled this season. His 23rd-place finish in Italy could have been a career-best sixth if he'd hit all 20 targets -- he missed two, which meant a two-minute penalty added to his time. His career-best result is an eighth in a 20-km race at a 2008 World Cup race in Slovenia.</p>
<p>"My skiing has let me down because I haven't felt strong," he says simply.</p>
<p>Clegg will race the relay with Quebec City's Jean Philippe Le Guellec, a strong up-and-comer who will compete in the individual races, Marc-</p>
<p>André Bédard of Valcartier, Que., and Brendan Green of Hay River, N.W.T. The Territories can claim two athletes in the relay; Clegg was born in Yellowknife.</p>
<p>Confident the Canadian men's relay team can make a statement, they were unable to crack the Top 10 in three World Cup races this season, finishing 13th, 14th, 17th.</p>
<p>The relay team had its best showing almost 14 months ago, when it placed seventh in December 2008. Canada was only 55 seconds away from the bronze medal.</p>
<p>"That was a respectable result," says Clegg, who has never raced an Olympic relay, but his best individual result in four races was a 36th over 20 kilometres in 2006. "At Hochfilzen, we could have (won a medal). We were so close. It depends on the day."</p>
<p>"On the Olympic stage, stuff can happen."</p>
<p>One thing that will happen is when Clegg completes his leg of the relay, it will serve as his final meaningful race before retirement.</p>
<p>Clegg's path to the podium</p>

</p>
<p>What you choose to feed yourself is one thing, but deciding what to feed your children is more complicated.</p>
<p>After his son was born, Jonathan Safran Foer set about researching animal farming. The result is Eating Animals (Little Brown; 352 pages, $31.99). It's the first non-fiction work from the writer who is best known for his fiction -- 2002's Everything is Illuminated and 2005's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.</p>
<p>Eating Animals turned from what Foer thought would be a straightforward argument for a vegetarian diet into a detailed exploration of the environmental, ethical and social reasons we eat, or don't eat, animals.</p>
<p>It's a great book, one of the best I've read on food production.</p>
<p>I'm not a vegetarian, but my girlfriend is. So most of the time we cook vegetarian meals. But I still eat meat on occasion, and when I do I deliberately try to buy organic, free-range or ethical products -- at least until I finished Eating Animals.</p>
<p>What did I learn? That animal agriculture practices make a 40 per cent greater contribution to carbon emissions than all transportation in the world, combined. It's the No. 1 cause of climate change. The single greatest thing we can do to slow climate change is to eat less meat.</p>
<p>Foer focuses on factory farming, which is how most meat is produced, typically in indoor pens packed with thousands of animals. He describes the poultry and hog industries in graphic, unnerving detail. I found myself disgusted reading about the conditions and suffering in a factory farm or large-scale slaughterhouse, from "thumping" -- taking a sick piglet by its hind legs and whacking it on the concrete floor to kill it -- to "downers," animals which are tossed into a pile to die rather than being euthanized.</p>
<p>The book includes statements from factory farm workers, slaughterhouse employees, activists, vegan ranchers, a heritage turkey farmer and a vegan who builds slaughterhouses. These different viewpoints allow readers to come to their own conclusions, though each anecdote builds toward a compelling argument: Factory farming in any capacity, whether it's "organic," which means the animals are farmed organically, but could still be tortured before slaughter, or "free-range," which means the animals can roam in about the same amount of space they would have in a cage, is cruel and unsustainable in an environmental or economic sense.</p>
<p>Two main points stand out to me: the risk of new diseases developing in the squalid factory-farm conditions (such as the swine flu, which jumped from pigs to people) and the environmental impact of the factory farm, usually due to huge quantities of feces.</p>
<p>A typical hog factory farm generates 3.3 million kilograms of feces, while a typical cattle feedlot produces 156 million kilograms. With thousands of animals cooped up and unable to roam, that waste becomes a football field-sized pool, containing all sorts of chemicals and pathogens. These waste fields aren't just environmentally damaging, they're death traps.</p>
<p>Foer quotes a Rolling Stone story about an entire family of workers jumping into the waste, one after another, trying to save a family member who fell in. They all drowned, overwhelmed by fumes.</p>
<p>A section on bycatch in fisheries -- when fish that are not the desired catch are caught -- is shocking. Foer writes that a typical shrimp-trawling operation throws 80 to 90 per cent of the sea animals it captures overboard, most dead or dying. Of those species, many are skate, shark, mackerel, marlin, dolphin ... the list goes on and on. He writes that for every 10 tuna, sharks and other large predatory fish that were in oceans 50 to 100 years ago, only one is left.</p>
<p>If North Americans continue to consume factory-farmed animals, and if other countries invest heavily in factory-farming methods, it will drive the cost of grain to the point where developing countries which rely on grain for food can't afford it. It's estimated that by 2050, the world's livestock will consume as much food as four billion people, he writes.</p>
<p>Foer presents the idea of the "selective omnivore" as a nice fantasy, only possible if all meat came from small farms growing heritage animals in ideal conditions, and then slaughtered in a cruelty-free way. He thinks that's impossible; and even if it could be done, supply could never meet current demand, and certainly not at today's prices.</p>
<p>Foer takes into account that some animal agriculture could be sustainable. He visits several family farms, smaller-scale farms that try to give the animals the best life possible, and take animal welfare and slaughter into account.</p>
<p>After reading the book, I called livestock farmer Tom Henry and animal rights activist Dave Shishkoff.</p>
<p>Henry, 48, farms hogs, sheep, holly and grain at Sea Bluff Farm on Vancouver Island, and is the editor and co-publisher of Small Farm Canada, a bimonthly magazine with a circulation of about 17,000 copies. He says that sustainable agriculture is possible, so long as the farmers give the animals a good life and slaughter them respectfully.</p>
<p>"A mantra for small farmers is that the livestock needs to be able to express its natural tendencies. For a chicken, that's scratching and pecking; for a pig, that's rooting and wallowing in mud; for a sheep, that's fresh grass to graze on," he says. "In industrial agriculture, those experiences are denied to them."</p>
<p>If small farming is done right, Henry says, more attention is paid to individual animals. When one starts to limp or cough, the farmer should know about it. They should know, too, if an animal is happy.</p>
<p>"We like to think that we're able to facilitate a better ending; meaning that we can make the transportation experience a little less traumatic," he says.</p>
<p>In his book, Foer discusses how many factory-farmed animals die due to stress from transportation.</p>
<p>Henry takes his animals to a slaughterhouse in Courtenay, because he likes the way it operates and treats the animals. He says he has visited industrial agriculture slaughterhouses and they reeked of death. With his current slaughterhouse, he leads his animals from the truck to a pen, and not with the lead-pipe cruelty or brutality reported by Foer at large-scale slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>Henry raises his animals with a combination of outdoor-and-indoor farming. About 80 per cent of his animals are sold to local consumers directly, the majority of whom visit his farm to see how it operates. This is typical of small farms, Henry says.</p>
<p>Not all farms are created equal, though, and just because a farm is small doesn't mean the people running it are adept at handling or raising animals.</p>
<p>"I've seen some nightmare situations where animals are transported in trailers with horrible ventilation or in unsafe conditions. It's not like small farmers have a lock on correct animal treatment. And maybe what [Foer] would say is that 'Yeah, that's my point. None of you livestock guys are any good.'</p>
<p>"It's a really interesting argument in Eating Animals. I have to say, as a farmer, the argument is not simple. Nothing is black and white."</p>
<p>Henry recommends that anyone interested in local meat contact farmers directly, or go through a shop or market that deals with ethical operations. He also says that some kind of system to designate and regulate ethical farming should be developed.</p>
<p>Shishkoff, 34, has been a vegan since he was 14. He's the Canadian spokesperson for the group Friends of Animals and publisher of the Victoria Vegan.</p>
<p>"I don't really distinguish between factory and family farming. As a vegan, my perspective is that it's a death sentence for the animal, no matter where they are," says Shishkoff.</p>
<p>"There've been articles about how even 'free-range' or 'organic' farming can contribute more greenhouse emissions than factory farming. Some of the factors include deforestation, and since the animals are out and about, they consume more food and produce more waste."</p>
<p>The David Suzuki Foundation suggests people eat at least one meat-free meal a week, Shishkoff says. The greenhouse emissions from animal agriculture are another reason to not eat meat, though a vegetarian or vegan diet is a big step for most people, he says.</p>
<p>"If people are serious about climate change, they have to make some serious changes in their own lives and their own habits. That's on a large scale -- it's not just turning off your lights when you leave the house," Shishkoff says.</p>
<p>"This is something you do every single day, three times a day. They're not hard changes, but they're changes, regardless."</p>

</p>
<p>Excited astronomers recently discovered a new world called Planet GJ 1214b that's supposedly more Earth-like than any ever found - outside our solar system.</p>
<p>That's comforting news as we search the universe for a replacement Earth, now that we're ruining this one.</p>
<p>Planet GJ 1214b does have some drawbacks. It's a soaking-wet place that has been described as "waterworld" - like ours may look after the polar ice caps melt. Why can't we discover a beachworld, or forestworld, or <span class="companylink">Disney</span> world? Also, the new planet is 40 light years away with temperatures pushing 200 degrees, which seems excessive - even when we're all thinking about warm winter getaways. However, reading about this new planet has me thinking: What would an ideal planet be like if humans someday have to flee Earth and find alternate accommodations? After a year of swine flu, global warming, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Haitian catastrophe, maybe there's a better world out there somewhere. But don't get me wrong - Earth is a great planet and I've had a great stay here. In fact, I'd love to stay a few centuries longer.</p>
<p>I love our planet's colours: its grassy greens, sky blues and other "earth" tones - though I could live with less winter white. I'm awed by our oceans, deserts, mountains and rainforests, but I appreciate many smaller things, too, like Leonard Cohen, Meryl Streep and the sausage sandwich at Momesso's on Upper Lachine Rd., one of the best in our galaxy.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a very well-designed world - not too hot or cold, except in Montreal in February. But let's face it, there's always room for improvement - even Toyotas aren't perfect anymore.</p>
<p>Just because you love your planet doesn't mean you can't fantasize about another. As we enter a new decade and gaze ahead, what would I want from a perfect planet? Planned planethood: This place is chaos. We've got tidal waves, flash floods, ice storm, tsunamis, volcanoes, sandstorms and earthquakes. We've got snow, hail, sleet, slush and freezing drizzle.</p>
<p>It can rain any old time and ruin a perfectly good weekend - then turn sunny Monday morning as you step into work. Who organized this system, anyway? Obviously, a better designed planet would have rain only at night, then be sunny all day. Or, perhaps, it wouldn't rain on weekends, just weekdays, from 9-5.</p>
<p>Our 24-hour day is a good system, but those long winter nights are a downer.</p>
<p>My perfect planet would have 16-hour days and eight-hour nights, with nine on weekends so you could sleep in.</p>
<p>Fast-food planet: Earth's food supply is fabulous - way better than if we lived somewhere like the moon - but it's not always easy to get at. This has forced us to invent agriculture, a long and back-breaking process.</p>
<p>I mean, why are coconuts way up in the air, or potatoes way down where you have to scrabble in the dirt? In an ideal planet, everything would resemble bananas, which have a ziplock design even a child can open. In fact, why can't CDs and other packaging be like that? Wouldn't it be great if spaghetti hung from a tree, ready to pluck like apples? On a perfect planet, pasta trees would be waist-high - right beside the rosé sauce bushes.</p>
<p>Decor-mag planet: Earth's decor has much to admire: gorgeous clouds, star-filled skies, fabulous sunsets, rainbows and Northern Lights - when you can see them through the smog. We have a glorious ever-changing moon - but why can't we have 62 more, like Jupiter, and some nifty Saturn-style rings? Gravity is definitely a good design concept, but a little rigid. Sometimes I wish I could slip the surly bonds of Earth and take an aerial spin - without an airplane. Why is flying just for the birds? Earth's other wildlife is quite spectacular, though I can't really compare it with elsewhere. Maybe there's some planet with a 100-foot, three-headed giraffe, or a peacock with a dozen tails. Maybe there's a world where mosquitoes don't have stingers.</p>
<p>I can think of other improvements, too: a planet with no cancer, or malaria, or swine flu, where the common cold isn't so common. What about a planet with no death, so we could all live forever? Then again, how much fun would it be to have a lot of 50,000-year-olds grumbling that things have never been much good since those fun Cro-Magnon days? Overall, I'd settle for a planet with no war, no famine, no poverty and less misery. But since inhabitable planets are in short supply, we Earthlings may just have to make that happen here.</p>
<p>Until then, Happy February - and here's to more mirth on Earth.</p>

</p>
<p>The global death toll from swine flu has risen to 15,174, up 463 from a week ago, but the pandemic is steadily losing momentum around the world, the World Health Organization said yesterday.</p>
<p>"As of 31 January 2010, worldwide more than 209 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 15,174 deaths," the WHO said.</p>
<p>According to the latest bulletin from the UN health agency, the Americas have recorded the biggest number of fatalities with at least 7,261 deaths from the A(H1N1) virus, while Europe has recorded at least 3,605 fatalities.</p>
<p>At least 3,127 people have died from the virus in the east Asia and west Pacific regions, WHO said.</p>
<p>But the spread of the virus continued to decline or remain low across most of the world - from the temperate northern hemisphere to North Africa and Asia - after having peaked between October and December 2009.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Seek health advice before last-minute travel</b>
</div><div>Rosemary McCracken   </div>

<div>1002 words</div><div>6 February 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>H5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Last-minute travel is a great way to vacation at a fraction of the regular cost. But travellers who book trips just a few days before departure may overlook several things, the most important of which is protecting their health.</p>
<p>"If a charter flight has seats available and a resort has empty rooms, the traveller can realize fantastic savings," says Carla Lemaire, curriculum co-ordinator of the travel program at Grant MacEwan University in Edmonton.</p>
<p>One downside, she notes, is last-minute travellers have a limited choice of destinations. Another is travellers may not be aware of tropical diseases at sun destinations. Or they may assume they'll be immune because they'll be staying at five-star resorts or on cruise ships.</p>
<p>"But if you leave your hotel or ship for daytrips into wilderness areas, or consume food or beverages off-site, you may be vulnerable," Lemaire says. "Or people who prepare food at your resort may be infected."</p>
<p>Last-minute travellers may also think they don't have enough time to be vaccinated against tropical diseases.</p>
<p>A 2008 survey of 1,511 Canadians by Leger Marketing found that although 59 per cent of Canadians have taken or considered taking last-minute vacations, almost half don't think they'd have time to seek travel health advice before departure. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 per cent 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>But there's usually enough time to take precautions. Vaccines and medications preventing tropical diseases usually need to be started well in advance of departure to be effective, but accelerated dosages are available.</p>
<p>Hepatitis A and B both attack the liver and are major concerns for travellers. Contracted through contaminated food and water, hepatitis A requires two vaccinations. But Dr. Sarah Thrasher, medical director of the Travel Medicine and Vaccination Centre's 19 branches throughout B.C., says travellers can have the first shot the day before travel, which will help fight the disease. The second should be taken six to 12 months later.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B is contracted from contaminated blood and body fluids, and can result in acute liver problems. It requires three shots, "but if we're driven to it," Thrasher says, "we can give the first two shots at the same time."</p>
<p>Malaria is spread by infected female Anopheles mosquitoes that bite from dusk until dawn. Malaria is currently prevalent in parts of the Dominican Republic. Prevention usually means taking oral prescription medicine, starting a week or two before departure. "But daily medication can be taken, beginning the day before departure," Thrasher says.</p>
<p>Precautions to avoid tropical illnesses include drinking bottled water, and peeling fruits and vegetables to prevent hepatitis A; and avoiding tattoos, body piercings and unprotected sex to prevent hepatitis B and HIV.</p>
<p>The Anopheles mosquito feeds at night, so travellers should wear long sleeves and pants and insect repellent containing DEET on exposed flesh when outside in the evening. Pregnant women and the elderly are at risk for malaria even when taking anti-malaria medication.</p>
<p>There are no vaccines or medications that prevent dengue fever, a flu-like illness spread by a daytime feeding mosquito in many tropical areas. Thrasher says dengue fever is less common in coastal regions than inland, but there have been outbreaks in urban areas such as Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>"Prevention is all about protective clothing and insect repellent," she says.</p>
<p>She also recommends vaccinations against H1N1 and seasonal influenza for anyone travelling by airplane. "Hopefully the last-minute traveller has already had these shots," she says, "because they require some time to take effect."</p>
<p>Travel medical insurance is not sold at travel health clinics, but Thrasher says her staff reminds travellers of the importance of purchasing it through a travel agent or an insurance company. Travellers who find themselves in hospital abroad without medical coverage will face bills that will take a huge chunk out of their savings.</p>
<p>But Lemaire advises against purchasing travel insurance online. "You need to see the policy to know exactly how much coverage you're getting," she says.</p>
<p>"Look at the details and don't be guided by price," she adds. "If a crisis happens, you'll want the best coverage, the deluxe package that covers everything from air evacuation with a private-duty nurse to bringing your family to your bedside abroad."</p>
<p>She also advises against booking last-minute trips online. Licensed travel agents have access to suppliers' last-minute deals, she says, and they'll tell clients what to expect on a particular trip.</p>
<p>As well as pointing out health considerations, travel agents will also help you avoid other problems. "You may not realize, for example, that you can't take your child out of the country without written consent from the child's other parent," she says.</p>
<p>Only experienced travellers should consider online last-minute deals, says David McCaig, Vancouver-based president of the Association of Canadian Travel Agents.</p>
<p>"We've heard of cases in which an online company didn't inform travellers that they needed visas to enter their destination country," he says. "They bought their tickets but when they arrived at their airport, they weren't allowed to board the plane without the visa."</p>
<p>Before booking a trip, travellers should check the destination country's website to see if entry visas are required.</p>
<p>They should also check their passport's expiry date. Some countries won't admit travellers whose passports will soon need to be renewed.</p>
<p>Canadians living in Canada generally have to allow two weeks to pick up their passports in person after applying for them. Faster delivery may be available for those with proof of an urgent need to travel.</p>

<p>An editorial in the Ottawa Citizen:</p>
<p>Twelve years ago a British doctor started a hoax that worked its way into the public consciousness, and though it has been exposed, the case is a cautionary tale ...</p>
<p>The doctor, Andrew Wakefield, examined 12 children and concluded that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine may cause autism and bowel disease. His team published the findings in the Lancet, a major medical journal, giving the work instant credibility ...</p>
<p>Soon the study started to unravel. First it emerged that Wakefield was funded by a group suing the makers of the vaccine. Then trial after trial showed his conclusions are simply wrong ... This week the Lancet finally announced it "fully retracts" the study. But it's too late to undo much of the damage; vaccination rates have fallen in Canada and many countries, causing measles outbreaks.</p>
<p>Go hunting for vaccine information on the Internet, and you can't avoid the conspiracy theories. The fear has spread to all vaccines ... Even though the H1N1 virus turned out to be milder than health authorities feared, it has still killed more than 14,000 people around the world ... But that doesn't matter to the anti-vaccine conspiracists, who remain convinced that flu shots are part of a plot by governments, media and drug companies.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A super-lab to fight superbugs - Project in works to expand city's disease research centre</b>
</div><div>By Mia Rabson and Dan Lett    </div>
<div>2028 words</div><div>6 February 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government is studying a proposal to build a $300-million expansion of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for a one-of-a-kind bench-to-bedside research facility in hospital superbugs.</p>
<p>The Level 5 Laboratory Infectious Disease Control Campus would aim to prevent and control hospital-borne bugs, which affect more than 250,000 Canadians each year and result in more than 8,000 deaths.</p>
<p>It would be the only facility of its kind in the world and would help solidify Winnipeg as an international centre for infectious disease research.</p>
<p>In the original proposal for the project, the partners called it a "quantum leap in Winnipeg's and Canada's existing leadership in the science and control of infectious diseases."</p>
<p>It would create up to 400 research and commercialization jobs and put $176 million into the province's economy each year. It would aim to cut the spread of hospital-acquired infections such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by 20 per cent across Canada in less than a decade.</p>
<p>The project, known colloquially as L5L, would include research on superbugs like C. difficile and MRSA, with a focus on preventing their spread and treating them with everything from better drugs and new vaccines to improved ventilation systems and maybe even bacteria-resistant bed sheets and window coverings.</p>
<p>Sources have told the Free Press Manitoba regional minister Vic Toews is solidly behind the proposal, although Toews would not speak to the Free Press about it. His office directed questions to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>An Aglukkaq spokesman said no decision has been made yet on funding.</p>
<p>"The government of Canada is looking at various options for a research facility and this is one of a number of proposals that have come forward," said her spokesman, Tim Vail.</p>
<p>Multiple sources aware of the L5L plans said the project has Toews' attention. "The regional minister has made it a priority," said a source at one of the partners involved in the project.</p>
<p>The existing National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is the legacy of another Manitoba regional cabinet minister, Tory Jake Epp, who initiated plans for the lab in 1987 when he was the federal health minister. It was, in part, a consolation prize for the CF-18 fiasco, which saw Manitoba lose an aircraft maintenance contract to Quebec despite having a cheaper and better bid.</p>
<p>Some wonder if the latest expansion may, in fact, be the consolation prize for Winnipeg losing out on a bid for a pilot HIV vaccine manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>That facility, part of the Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative, was believed to be destined for Winnipeg last summer after the International Centre for Infectious Diseases was told informally it had the best bid of the four finalists. But last month, ICID CEO Heather Medwick was told, along with the other three finalists, they hadn't won after all.</p>
<p>It's unknown at the moment what is happening with the vaccine facility. But some fear its demise is due to local and national politics, including the Liberal ties of ICID's former CEO and Quebec-based pharmaceutical companies balking at losing lucrative HIV vaccine contracts to a non-profit facility with ties to generic drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>A presentation on L5L was made to Finance Minister Jim Flaherty when he was in Winnipeg for pre-budget consultations last month.</p>
<p>As well, the proponents on Jan. 20 registered the name L5L Life Sciences as a business with the Manitoba Companies Office. It's believed Western Economic Diversification has tentatively agreed to a $3-million initial funding.</p>
<p>The concept of L5L has been in discussion for years but was first officially proposed to Ottawa in December 2008 in a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, signed by University of Manitoba president David Barnard, Winnipeg Regional Health Authority CEO Dr. Brian Postl, then-International Centre for Infectious Diseases CEO Terry Duguid and Smith Carter Architects CEO Scott Stirton.</p>
<p>That proposal was subsequently presented to a number of cabinet ministers early in 2009, including ministers of health, infrastructure, and industry. The response was positive but there was a major snag to it getting funding in the federal budget last year.</p>
<p>The focus of the 2009 budget was economic stimulus and there was more than $12 billion set aside for new infrastructure, including $250 million for national laboratory upgrades.</p>
<p>However, all the projects had to be completed by March 2011 and the L5L proposal was definitely not "shovel-ready."</p>
<p>So the Jan. 25, 2009 budget came and went without mention of L5L.</p>
<p>It didn't ever die completely but it was shelved temporarily when it didn't get funding. In the fall, it was resurrected with the backing of Toews and Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director at the National Microbiology Laboratory and scientific adviser at the Public Health Agency of Canada. Former chief innovation officer at the WRHA, Harry Schulz, is reportedly helping drive the project. He now works under Plummer at PHAC. Jo Kennelly, one-time senior political adviser to former federal health minister Tony Clement, is also among the project's lead drivers.</p>
<p>Negotiations to get the project back on track took place between Plummer, Schulz, Kennelly and the ICID last fall. However, ICID's Medwick said her organization isn't involved any longer.</p>
<p>"In the past month or so it has changed," she said. "I honestly don't know what is going on with L5L."</p>
<p>Medwick said there were three options to fund and operate L5L initially -- totally private, totally public or mostly public but operated by ICID as a non-governmental agency.</p>
<p>She said she no longer is aware which option is being investigated. Other ICID sources say the agency was interested but the board had concerns about the lack of a business plan for the new proposal, which included a partnership with a U.S. property developer and funding from PHAC, to be recouped by the government over 25 years through leases from tenants such as the U of M, WRHA and private biotech companies.</p>
<p>Premier Greg Selinger said he is aware of the L5L proposal, although he has not been told about how it would be financed, including details of a possible public-private partnership.</p>
<p>Selinger said an expansion of the federal laboratory would be welcomed in Manitoba, which has been working hard to solidify its reputation as a centre of excellence in microbiology and virology.</p>
<p>"I definitely want to see that cluster grow," Selinger said, "but we just haven't seen details on the financing arrangements. We need more information."</p>
<p>Winnipeg NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis agreed expanding the lab is good for Manitoba, but expressed concern there has been no public information about L5L Life Sciences and no public discussion about whether a public-private partnership is appropriate for this kind of development. She also said the federal government should not be giving out a sole-source contract to any group without proper scrutiny.</p>
<p>"This is a very cloudy situation," said Wasylycia-Leis, who sits on the federal health committee.</p>
<p>Manitoba NDP MP Pat Martin, who submitted a letter of support for the original proposal in December 2008, said Friday he is extremely excited about the whole prospect. "It puts Manitoba on the map," Martin said.</p>
<p>Heidi Graham, spokeswoman for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said the WRHA is still very much "interested and involved" in the project, but said Postl was not available to comment. She referred further questions to Plummer, who is at the helm of the proposal. Digvir Jayas, vice-president (research) at the University of Manitoba, said the U of M is participating in ongoing discussions "with great interest."</p>
<p>"The Level 5 Laboratory initiative offers an exciting opportunity for this community," Jayas said.</p>
<p>The National Microbiology Laboratory is already a crown jewel in Winnipeg, employing more than 400 people, including 100 research scientists. It has been on the front line of a number of international infectious disease projects, most recently helping to identify the H1N1 virus and develop a vaccine for it.</p>

<p>What are superbugs?</p>
<p>Also known as hospital-acquired infections, they're acquired by patients in hospital undergoing treatment for something else, often surgery. The Canadian Institute for Health Research estimates one in 10 adults and one in 12 children who enter a hospital will get an infection. A 2003 study in Canada found 220,000 patients developed a hospital infection and 8,000 Canadians died from one.</p>
<p>The most severe of these infections are resistant to antibiotics and are very difficult to treat. Many cause patients severe stress, prolong hospital stays and in extreme cases result in the closure of hospital wards. Some say the cost to Canada's health-care system each year from infections is more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>The worst of these bugs include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and C. difficile.</p>
<p>Infections are transferred to patients from any number of sources, including telephones, call buttons, sheets, towels and surgical instruments.</p>
<p>The incidence of MRSA increased 17-fold in Canada between 1995 and 2006.</p>
<p>In Great Britain, the Journal for Infection Prevention reports MRSA was listed on one in 500 death certificates between 2001 and 2005 and C. difficile was listed on one in 250 death certificates.</p>
<p>MRSA</p>
<p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium found commonly on the skin and in the nose of one in three healthy people. However, when it enters the body through breaks in the skin, such as surgical wounds, it can cause a broad range of symptoms, including redness, swelling, boils and fever. It is resistant to antibiotics and some infections can be fatal.</p>
<p>An outbreak at Concordia Hospital in Winnipeg in 2007 affected 42 people.</p>
<p>C. difficile</p>
<p>Clostridium difficile is sometimes known as hospital diarrhea. It usually causes mild symptoms but can lead to serious illness and death. It is not resistant to antibiotics in most cases, but stronger versions of the bacterium are being discovered. One Quebec study found C. difficile responsible for the deaths of more than 100 patients in hospital in a six-month period.</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, outbreaks of C. difficile at Grace Hospital affected 15 people in 2007 and 33 in 2008.</p>

<div>Report on Business: Canadian</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Jobless rate dips to 9-month low; January marks fourth month of job creation in past half year, but factories still suffering</b>
</div><div>TAVIA GRANT    </div>
<div>774 words</div><div>6 February 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Canada's economy created 43,000 jobs in January, nudging the jobless rate to a nine-month low of 8.3 per cent and providing encouragement that the country's employment picture is steadily brightening.</p>
<p>It was the fourth gain in jobs in six months – and a stark contrast to the same month last year, when employers shed a record 130,000 positions. The country's young people are also beginning to find work, Statistics Canada reported yesterday.</p>
<p>The good news, however, masked some sobering facts: All of the new jobs last month were in lower-paying part-time positions. The goods-producing side of the economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. And underemployment – the number of discouraged workers or people with part-time jobs who want full-time work – hit 12.3 per cent, compared with 11 per cent a year ago.</p>
<p>Temporary employment agencies, which tend to be leading indicators of labour market trends, confirm the slow pace of improvement.</p>
<p>“Most companies we're working with are still on the yellow light, not the green light yet, in making hiring decisions,” said Craig Brown, general manager for Canada at Spherion Staffing Services. “It's better than last year. But not full-bore ahead.”</p>
<p>Hiring is picking up at accounting and IT positions at financial firms, and logistics firms are ramping up this month, Mr. Brown said, adding that his company is hiring across the country.</p>
<p>More broadly, employment centres, security services and travel agencies led last month's job gains, Statscan said. Goods producers, such as factories and utilities, cut jobs.</p>
<p>“Even part-time, retail jobs for youth are better than seeing nothing at all,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CIBC World Markets Inc</span>. “We'll take what we can get in the early stages.”</p>
<p>Some temporary factors may be juicing the numbers, suggesting jobs reports will continue to be bumpy. British Columbia posted 12,000 new jobs last month, partly thanks to Olympic-related hiring in retail, food and accommodation. And health-care positions, which swelled with the nationwide H1N1 vaccination program, may subside as the program winds down.</p>
<p>Average monthly job growth in the November-to-January period is now 29,000, according to <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span>.</p>
<p>Still, the recession has vaporized 280,000 jobs from the economy, a loss that remains a central concern to policy makers in Ottawa. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said last month that job creation is a key priority for his government this year and that “more has to be done” on that front.</p>
<p>Worries remain about whether the private sector will start hiring again as stimulus spending fades and interest rates rise. In recent weeks, some companies such as <span class="companylink">Vidéotron Ltée</span>, SAS Canada and <span class="companylink">Garda World Security Corp</span>. have all announced hiring plans.</p>
<p>And they're being swamped with potential workers. <span class="companylink">Globalive Communications Corp</span>., for example, received 6,000 job applications before it posted any openings. The Toronto-based wireless company plans to hire 400 people this year, adding to its existing 700 staff. “We're confident about the coming year,” said Marieta Mendoza, head of recruitment. “It's only going to get brighter from here.”</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>CANADIAN LABOUR SNAPSHOT</p>
<p>JANUARY, 2009</p>
<p>Jobs lost: 130,000 – the most on record.</p>
<p>Jobless rate: 7.3 per cent</p>
<p>JANUARY, 2010 Jobs created: 43,000 Jobless rate: 8.3 per cent, down from 8.4 per cent a month earlier</p>
<p>By sector</p>
<p>• Business, building and other support services, along with retail and wholesale trade were the main drivers of employment increases last month. • Losses occurred in professional, scientific, and technical services, while manufacturing and agriculture also shed workers. By age • Women aged 25 to 54 and young people drove last month's gains.</p>
<p>• Youth jobs rose by 29,000, the first real increase since the labour market started its decline, pushing down their unemployment rate to 15.1 per cent from 16 per cent. • Older women have the lowest jobless rate, at 5.6 per cent. Part-time/Full-time</p>
<p>• Part-time employment climbed by 41,500 new positions last month, returning it to the level of six months ago. • Full-time employment rose by only 1,400, though it has been increasing over the past half year.</p>
<p>Private/Public</p>
<p>• The private sector created 53,700 positions last month; the public sector added 13,400 jobs. • Self-employment, which swelled throughout the past year as people had few other income options, fell by 24,000 positions.</p>

<p>In Winnipeg it's not hard to find help if you're feeling down; there are many help phones you can call, counsellors available to talk to, and many programs to take part in. When I was suicidal, I felt alone and cut off from the world. I was in a big city. I can't imagine how much worse it would be in a small community where you are miles and miles away from the next city where there are distractions to help you cope.</p>
<p>A recent comment quoted in the Winnipeg Free Press summed it up succinctly: "We've heard so much about swine flu -- that's all we've heard about for weeks. But there is suicide after suicide in aboriginal communities and you don't ever hear about those." I completely agree with this statement. Yes, swine flu is terrible, and yes, swine flu has taken lives, but how many suicides have gone unnoticed? Why haven't we learned from this?</p>
<p>Suicide and self-injury are the leading causes of death for First Nations people between the ages of 10-44. For First Nations males 15 to 24 years old, the suicide rate is 126 per 100,000 compared to 24 per 100,000 for the same age group among the general population. For First Nations women between 15 to 24 years old, the suicide rate is 25 per 100,000 compared to only five per 100,000 for non-aboriginal women. Saying all this, I would also like to point out that not every aboriginal community experiences suicide.</p>
<p>As much as I would like to blame the government for all of this, I really can't. We all have to take some sort of initiative to help. In 2009 the provincial government supplied more than $600,000 to help aboriginal children and youth to become more physically active, develop skills and leadership abilities, as well as to support community development. Of that money, $100,000 helped fund Klinic's successful Teen Talk program from youth from the North. We can help by financially supporting community-based programs like the Aboriginal Suicide and Critical Incident Response Team (ASCRIT), Dare to Dream, or the Inuusiqatsiarniq/Suicide Prevention program. Shedding light on current situations just by talking about them with others is a good way to bring awareness to the issue. Media coverage is also an important part of awareness; we rarely hear about reserves in the first place unless it's about H1N1.</p>
<p>Now I've done my fair share of research, and I know it just seems like some angsty teen saying "we're not doing enough, blah, blah, blah." I've experienced a lot and yes, I can be full of angst, anyone can, but this really is a problem. How many people have to die before we stop being so naive?</p>

</p>
<p>1. Italy</p>
<p>From the hills of Tuscany to the ruins of Rome, Italy is known for its unparalleled beauty, food and shopping. Travellers often find themselves exploring the vast countryside or jumping on a train to see the sites. For most, the main attraction is the country's rich history. Shown here is Rome's ancient Colosseum.</p>
<p>2. Egypt</p>
<p>For an affordable yet fascinating vacation, Egypt ranks high on the charts. Not only has Egypt remained consistently geopolitically stable, but it is also home to the Great Pyramid of Giza. Despite the hot temperatures year-round, tourists never seem to get enough of Egypt's many facets. Shown here is Pharaoh Ramses II at Abu Simbel.</p>
<p>3. Greece</p>
<p>Greece is a sought-after destination where beauty, culture and history collide. With gorgeous beaches, ancient ruins, and tributes to the Gods, honeymooners often retreat to the Greek Isles for a romantic getaway, while avid travellers dig deep into the history of the country. Meteora, above, in central Greece, is a spectacular collection of centuries-old monasteries and churches built atop jutting cliffs, most of which are accessible by bus or car.</p>
<p>4. Turkey</p>
<p>Similar to Egypt, Turkey's tourism industry has grown over the years because of its affordability as an international destination. Upon arrival, visitors are enchanted by unique historical and archeological sites, majestic mountains and valleys, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, castles, mosques and a beautiful coastline. Shown is Turkey's best-known archeological site, Ephesus, once a great trading and religious centre on the Aegean coast.</p>
<p>5. Peru</p>
<p>Home to Machu Picchu, shown above, Peru has emerged in recent years as a very popular tourist destination. With 17th-century architecture, Inca ruins and uninhabited jungles, Peru is waiting to be explored. The capital city Lima acts as the central district both financially and culturally while the ancient Inca capital of Cuzco draws nearly one million visitors each year.</p>
<p>6. Oberammergau, Germany</p>
<p>Oberammergau is a small Bavarian village located on the Ammer River in South Central Germany amongst the Bavarian Alps. But it's not the town's charming location that entices nearly half a million people to journey there every 10 years -- it is the world famous Passion Play, shown above. This play was performed by the natives of Oberammergau in 1634. The natives vowed to enact the Passion of Christ every 10 years if Jesus would end their suffering and spare their lives during the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>7. Israel/Jordan</p>
<p>Located in the heart of the Middle East and boasting tremendous historical and religious significance, Israel and the Palestinian-ruled West Bank represent the meeting of three faiths -- Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Visitors to Israel also find themselves exploring Jordan and its most popular city, the Rose Red City of Petra, shown above, as well as the Dead Sea that has coasts on both countries.</p>
<p>8. China</p>
<p>With its rapidly growing infrastructure and budding economy, China is a blend of modern sophistication and rich tradition. It's this unique combination that makes the country a popular destination. There's the Great Wall of China and Beijing's famed Temple of Heaven, with its white marbled, circular altar. Other popular cities include Xian, one of the oldest, and Shanghai, which this year will host the World Expo. Shown here is the funnel-shaped "Sunny Valley" that stands at the entrance to Expo 2010. The huge structure channels sunlight into underground areas and also collects rainwater for recycling.</p>
<p>9. India</p>
<p>With a population of more than one billion, India is one of the most diverse countries in the world. In Delhi, tourists will find gorgeous Hindu temples and the Qutub Minar, the world's tallest free-standing brick minaret, shown above. At 72.5 metres, the Qutab Minar in Delhi is the world's tallest minaret. Not far from Delhi is also the city of Agra, home to the Taj Mahal. India is not only thrilling but affordable.</p>
<p>10. Costa Rica</p>
<p>From volcanoes and waterfalls to uninhibited wildlife, Costa Rica has rapidly grown as a popular ecotourism destination. Thrill seekers can enjoy the wide array of wildlife and biodiversity, as well as adventure activities such as the zipline canopy and hanging bridges. As a whole, Costa Rica has increased in popularity as Mexico continues to recover from the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic. Here, San Lucas Island is a heritage site that was once a notorious penal colony.</p>

<p>Re: "It's not gas prices or job loss, it's the parking fee," Naomi Lakritz, Opinion, Feb. 3.</p>
<p>My goodness, whenever there's an issue, the self-proclaimed experts and excuse purveyors can't wait to crawl out of the woodwork. First, the city and the mayor blame job losses for the reduction in transit ridership, then up pops Naomi Lakritz calling their reasoning "lamebrained" with her pet peeve, the parking fee. To say the Brentwood parking lot is down 60 per cent due to the parking fee is nonsense. It may be part of it but only that. The Brentwood lot opened immediately when the Crowfoot station became operational, for obvious reasons. To anyone travelling every day down Crowchild Trail, it was evident that the standing-room-only cars at rush hour became open-seating shortly after the overblown H1N1 scare hit the media, and the reasons for that are also obvious. Transit ridership is down for many reasons and until someone undertakes a meaningful analysis to determine cause and effect, we would do well to avoid taking up printed space with inaccurate political reactionism and baseless column opining.</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>The H1N1 of the economy: It's baaack, the bogeyman of the 1990s and, before that, the 1980s: deficit hysteria. Get out the old Halloween masks. What's remarkable is how common sense – i.e., the wisdom of most people – resists panic even as politicians and opinion makers ladle it on. A recent Ipsos Reid poll found that 53 per cent of Canadians calmly feel that the federal government should run deficits of $30-billion to $40-billion to “stimulate the economy and get us out of this recession.” But a Globe and Mail story that included that poll was headlined, “Liberals would boost child care despite deficit.”</p>
<p>Back in 1995, the heyday of deficitophobia, an Ekos poll found that “as many Canadians agree as disagree with the statement that concern with the deficit has been manufactured by government and big business.” The pollster said it showed people even then were “tired of the mantras of the 1980s.” Yet, right after that poll, a national columnist wrote: “A clear majority of Canadians want Ottawa to cut the deficit …”</p>
<p>For politicians, the call to panic serves other uses. For the right, it's an excuse to slash “big government.” U.S. neo-con Grover Norquist advised starving government by cutting taxes until it can't afford to do anything that people value, then “drown it in the bathtub.” So George Bush cut taxes on the rich while running two wars; and Stephen Harper drove up the deficit by cutting the GST while spending heavily on the military. Then, with or without a recession, they can say: Sorry, but we can't afford those social programs.</p>
<p>The “left,” in turn, uses deficit terror to counter what it fears is its lack of hard-headed economic credibility. Bill Clinton, Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin dined out electorally on balancing their budgets, though no miracles were involved – it was done mostly by attacking the poor and the vulnerable. Nova Scotia's new NDP government is obsessed with eliminating its deficit. Even the business press calls it irrational. Meantime, the serious questions – not: Should taxes be raised or lowered? but: On whom should they be raised or lowered? – aren't discussed.</p>
<p>How does common sense resist these panics decade after decade? By a sense of real life. Most people would rather pay their way as they go, but, in a crunch, you increase the mortgage or take on debt rather than put your family on the street and pull the kids out of school. As things improve, you pay it off. It's like H1N1, the flu threat to “all of humanity” that never materialized – with federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty as chief public health officer David Butler-Jones. They do look a bit separated at birth.</p>
<p>Catcher in the wry? What I found striking in the testimonials on How J. D. Salinger Changed My Life is the fact that most witnesses read The Catcher in the Rye for high- school or university classes. Novelist Andrew Pyper said his copy had “Grade 10D” scrawled inside. It was those “phony” adults in authority – i.e., teachers and profs – who glommed onto it and assigned it. What happens when the sense of alienation at the core of your authentic self results from being told to read a book that you're graded on? “Supervised alienation,” says a writer I know. Would they have even discovered the book left to their own devices? They'll never find out.</p>
<p>Back around the time that Holden Caulfield first appeared in print, the neo-Freudian Erik Erikson suggested that excessively early toilet training may have undermined the sense of control and autonomy among a generation of Americans, leading to paranoia about Communist subversives and alien invaders. What about the emergence of a pervasive ironic sense in a later age? Holden Caulfield wasn't ironic, he was desperately earnest. But could irony be the response of a generation that was prematurely alienated, as it were, from its own alienation?</p>

</div><div>PAUL WALDIE   </div>
<div>606 words</div><div>5 February 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Concerns about the H1N1 flu may have eased, but the virus is still boosting the bottom lines of several companies – at least for now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, British drug giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span>, one of the world's largest makers of H1N1 vaccines, reported a 60-per-cent jump in fourth-quarter profit and a 17-per-cent increase in sales from the same period a year earlier. Profit increased to £1.63-billion ($2.76-billion), compared with £982-million a year earlier. Sales jumped to £8.1-billion.</p>
<p>“Obviously, H1N1 was a significant contributor to sales during the year,” Glaxo's chief executive officer Andrew Witty told analysts on a conference call.</p>
<p>Glaxo has invested heavily in vaccines in recent years, seeing the drugs as a way of minimizing losses as a result of increased competition from generic medicines. The vaccine investments gave the company a leg up when the H1N1 hit last year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Glaxo said its overall vaccine sales increased 30 per cent year over year and reached £3.7-billion. Sales of Relenza, a flu drug, were £720-million in 2009 compared with £57-million in 2008. Sales of H1N1 shots reached £883-million in 2009, most of which came in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the company said it lost £1.4-billion in sales because of generic competition.</p>
<p>Glaxo isn't the only company benefiting from H1N1.</p>
<p>Oakland, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">Clorox Co</span>., which makes Clorox bleach, Glad bags and Brita water filters, said H1N1 concerns boosted sales of its bleach and disinfectant wipes for the third straight quarter. Swine flu drove two percentage points of overall sales growth during the latest quarter.</p>
<p>“So, obviously, [H1N1] is a bit of a boom for us in the first half,” said Larry Peiros, chief operating officer of Clorox North America. Clorox said its profit in the fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, was up 28 per cent to $110-million (U.S.) Revenue climbed 5 per cent to $1.28-billion from $1.22-billion.</p>
<p>However, there are signs that the H1N1 impact may be running out of steam.</p>
<p>Glaxo noted that sales of H1N1 vaccines have flattened and that some governments are scaling back purchases of the flu shot.</p>
<p>Yesterday, health officials in Czech Republic said they plan to hold talks with Glaxo about cancelling purchases. The country had ordered one million doses. The British government also announced yesterday that it is closing its National Pandemic Flu Service because of a steady reduction in the number of cases.</p>
<p>“There's no certainty that a government isn't going to come back tomorrow morning or in three weeks' time and say, we want to have another conversation,” Mr. Witty said during the conference call. “So I can't – and I'm not going to pretend that these things are absolutely bulletproof because you are talking about working with very few customers on our whole business.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Witty said the company expects H1N1-related sales to be the same in 2010.</p>
<p>Clorox also noted that its H1N1-related sales have dropped in recent months. The company said sales of its disinfectant wipes jumped 40 per cent last October but have fallen sharply since then.</p>
<p>“Given concerns about H1N1 flu appear to be waning, we are anticipating a bit of a trough in our disinfecting products during the second half,” Mr. Peiros said.</p>

<p>Our precious soil</p>
<p>“Fertile soil is being lost faster than it can be replenished,” The Daily Telegraph reports, “and will eventually lead to the ‘topsoil bank' becoming empty, an Australian conference heard. … An estimated 75 billion tonnes of soil is lost annually with more than 80 per cent of the world's farming land ‘moderately or severely eroded,' the Carbon Farming conference heard. A University of Sydney study, presented to the conference, found soil is being lost in China 57 times faster than it can be replaced through natural processes. In Europe that figure is 17 times, in [the United States] 10 times, while five times as much soil is being lost in Australia.” The conference heard that world soil could vanish within about 60 years if drastic action was not taken.</p>
<p>The seat of learning</p>
<p>A British university registrar offered bogus degrees in return for spanking sessions in a hotel, a court was told this week, The Times of London reports. “Karl Woodgett, 37, former registrar at the University of Surrey and the University of Bath, already had a lucrative sideline selling degrees to African women when he came up with a way of satisfying his sexual desires at the same time. He told the women his name was Dave and that he could offer them a degree in return for their help with a ‘pain management study.'”</p>
<p>Electronic warfare</p>
<p>There has been a leap in the number of British students trying to cheat in their exams, The Guardian reports. “The most common type of cheating by pupils was bringing in unauthorized material – mainly phones and other electronic communication devices they could use to get on the Internet, access stored information or even covertly listen to recordings. Concealed earpieces can be bought online, some openly marketed as ‘exam cheat equipment.' Meanwhile, schools are being sold detection equipment to help them track down devices used against the rules in exam rooms.”</p>
<p>Noisy restaurants</p>
<p>“Many of the most cutting-edge, design-conscious restaurants are introducing a new level of noise to today's already voluble restaurant scene,” Katy McLaughlin reports for The Wall Street Journal. “The new noisemakers: Restaurants housed in cavernous spaces with wood floors, linen-free tables, high ceilings and lots of windows – all of which cause sound to ricochet around what are essentially hard-surfaced echo chambers. Upscale restaurants have done away with carpeting, heavy curtains, tablecloths and plush banquettes gradually over the decade, and then at a faster pace during the recession, saying such touches telegraph a fine-dining message out of sync with today's cost-conscious, informal diner. Those features, though, were also sound-absorbing. … Diners worried they will end up in a noisy restaurant may want to play defence with a few strategies. Googling pictures of the restaurant can be helpful: Walls of windows, high ceilings, boxy dimensions, a surfeit of hard lines and a dearth of soft materials should raise red flags.”</p>
<p>Who wins a gunfight?</p>
<p>“The mythology of the Wild West suggests the person who draws first in a gunfight is usually the first to get shot, and new findings now hint at a reason why this might happen,” Charles Chio writes for MSNBC.com. “… Now an international team of scientists has found a basis for this idea – people move faster when reacting than when initiating the same movement. But the ultimate outcome is not so simple. In laboratory versions of gunfights … the volunteers on average were roughly 10 per cent faster when they reacted than when they initiated ‘shootouts,' a boost in speed of roughly 21 milliseconds they dubbed the ‘reactive advantage.' Still, while participants moved faster when reacting than initiating, reactors only rarely beat initiators. The extra milliseconds it took volunteers to respond to the movements of their opponents greatly offset any benefit the reactive advantage granted.”</p>
<p>Were you as brave?</p>
<p>“Little Joe didn't even flinch,” Eric Moskowitz writes in The Boston Globe. “When the zookeeper in the surgical mask showed him the needle, Joe gave her a nonchalant look, glancing up and down. When she asked for his shoulder, he rotated slowly, munching on granola in a show of teenage toughness and indifference. By the time he stopped chewing and stared at his arm, the shot was already over. ‘Gooood boy,' crooned Brandi Baitchman, who administered the shot. ‘Nice job!' That was how it went when Joe, the best-known gorilla at [Boston's] Franklin Park Zoo, got his H1N1 vaccination [this week]. Not so different from a person but without the paperwork and tiny bandage. ‘We couldn't really give him a Band-Aid, because he'd eat it,' Ms. Baitchman</p>
<p>said. …”</p>

</p>
<p>Fending off the nearest thing this city has to a local saint to win a Legislature seat Thursday night was probably the easy part for Glen Murray.</p>
<p>Going into the Toronto Centre by-election, the former Winnipeg mayor had all the advantages. Profile. Considerable experience and political skill. A predecessor's organization and squads of political staffers from Queen's Park to pull the vote. Not to mention a likely fast track to Premier Dalton McGuinty's cabinet.</p>
<p>Even as stellar a challenger as New Democrat Cathy Crowe - a living, breathing call to the better angels of Toronto's nature - had an uphill battle.</p>
<p>Now, however, Murray has some work to do: living up to the expectations his career as urban guru have raised, and putting to rest suspicions he might be a sort of Liberal version of John Tory, all nimble mind and ceaseless tongue, great in theory but not so hot in political practice.</p>
<p>Now, Murray will have to turn his loquacious wonkery and affinity for the newest theory or buzzphrase to use in a provincial political world usually more concerned with the art of the possible than reaches that exceed the grasp.</p>
<p>In any event, the champion of things urban had been preparing to run for something pretty much since he arrived in Toronto from Winnipeg six years ago.</p>
<p>He kicked the tires of a possible campaign for the mayor's job here before settling for the provincial Liberal candidacy in one of the city's most quintessentially urban ridings.</p>
<p>In fact, the by-election at times seemed to focus more on what it meant for Glen Murray's career than for the voters of Toronto Centre.</p>
<p>By most accounts, it was his to lose - even after the NDP mustered as its candidate the celebrated "street nurse" who had been a front-line fighter in the war on poverty, on SARS, H1N1, bedbugs, tuberculosis, inhumane shelter conditions, homelessness and hunger.</p>
<p>Toronto Centre had been the turf of former deputy premier George Smitherman for more than a decade before he decided to seek the Toronto mayor's job, and Murray was heir to the former's organizational support.</p>
<p>Still, under the challenge from Crowe, and the risk that voters filling the seat for a mere 20 months might feel whimsical, Liberal nerves seemed on edge.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Murray played it cautious enough to duck two TV all-candidate debates - on TVO and on Goldhawk Live on Rogers.</p>
<p>And the government was sufficiently spooked, on the eve of voting day, to scrape up cash to help save Toronto Grace Health Centre in the riding - an issue that Murray initially dismissed as a "red herring."</p>
<p>Still, by-elections don't lend themselves to a so-called Ballot Question. Toronto Centre never threatened to become a referendum on the Liberal government's proposed harmonized sales tax.</p>
<p>The opposition's best hope was that McGuinty fatigue, or the stink of Smitherman's connection with the eHealth Ontario spending imbroglio, or Crowe's personal appeal might fuel an upset.</p>
<p>Now, after fending off that challenge, it's widely presumed Murray has a ticket stamped for McGuinty's inner circle.</p>
<p>His credentials, after all, are impressive. Urban champion. Progressive thinker. Small businessman. Green activist. Gay. And did we mention loquacious?</p>
<p>How that considerable regard for the sound of his voice plays among new colleagues likely resentful at the arrival of another queue-jumping star imported by the premier will also be interesting to watch.</p>
<p>In fact, descending from the Olympian heights of urban think-tankery might turn out to be a more trying journey for Murray that he expects.</p>
<p>There's only so much room in any caucus for philosopher kings.</p>

<p>Residents with alternative lifestyles may be the ones feeling the brunt of a whooping-cough outbreak in the Kootenays.</p>
<p>Health officials have reported 19 cases of whooping cough, all but one in children who have not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Kootenays have the lowest immunization rates in the Interior, with just 69 per cent of kids receiving vaccines.</p>
<p>Locals say the area is legendary as a haven for ex-hippies, back-to-nature types and free spirits.</p>
<p>But Dr. Rob Parker, chief medical officer for Interior Health, said Thursday the outbreak can't be pinpointed to one group or community.</p>
<p>"This is a general thing. It may embrace people with a simple, rustic natural lifestyle, but it's not just people living on farms. They live in towns as well," he said.</p>
<p>Whooping cough starts as a cold but escalates into a chronic, hacking cough that can last for 100 days. It sometimes results in death.</p>
<p>Parker said the number of cases reported during a two-month period is considered "quite unusual." Just three cases were reported in the previous two years.</p>
<p>"We fully expect to see more cases. It's still on the upswing," he said. "I would advise all parents with unimmunized children to consider getting them immunized."</p>
<p>The area affected is in the West Kootenays, including Nelson, the Slocan Valley, Castlegar, Trail and Salmo.</p>
<p>The disease's roots appear to lie with free spirits who refuse to get vaccinations. Locals say hippies came to live in the Slocan Valley in the 1960s, bringing skepticism about a variety of mainstream views.</p>
<p>"There are pockets of those people. We certainly have colourful characters," said Bob Hall, managing editor of the Nelson Daily News. "We're identified with the mother with dreadlocks and a stroller."</p>
<p>He most recently noticed resistance to vaccines last fall as letters-to-the-editor poured in against H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>One prominent anti-vaccine crusader is Jenny Craig, who wrote a 2009 book on the subject called Jabs, Jenner & Juggernauts.</p>
<p>"We're an enlightened community here. People grow their own food and are self-sufficient," said Craig, a onetime nurse with a PhD from McGill University.</p>
<p>"Vaccines are a danger to people's health. They contain muck. If people have knowledge, they won't get a vaccine," she said.</p>
<p>Important new information about vaccines came out this week.</p>
<p>Lancet, a respected medical journal, has disavowed a 12-year-old report that linked vaccines with autism. The magazine said the report contained falsehoods.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Was swine flu ever a real threat?; One European scientist alleges a WHO conspiracy for drug firms</b>
</div><div>Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>1221 words</div><div>4 February 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>It's been a good week for drug companies and an even better one for conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>Last week, angered by the bumper rise in profits being reported by vaccine manufacturers as the incidence of swine flu plummets, the former head of health at the Council for Europe accused the World Health Organization of "faking" the pandemic.</p>
<p>"It looks like the WHO is under the influence of industry," Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg told a hearing in Strasbourg, France. "It was stated in panic-stricken terms that this was a flu that could threaten humanity. This is why billions of medications were bought."</p>
<p>Exhibit No. 1, Wodarg says, is the WHO's decision to soften its definition of a pandemic last April, shortly before the emergence of the H1N1 virus. By eliminating the requirement that influenza pandemics should cause "enormous morbidity and death," the WHO provoked an unnecessary "scare" that conveniently triggered the activation of "sleeping" contracts with vaccine manufacturers. Yet since the WHO's declaration of a pandemic in June, swine flu has caused just 14,000 deaths worldwide -- a fraction of the number who die from seasonal flu every year. This month, Britain's Department of Health reported that cases had fallen to such a low rate that it was cancelling its weekly press briefings.</p>
<p>Like all conspiracy theorists, Wodarg started with the question "Cui bono?" and served up a plausible bad guy. For its part, the WHO vigorously denies the allegations and says Wodarg is "trivializing" what for millions of people has been a very serious problem.</p>
<p>So who is right? Was swine flu ever a genuine pandemic threat, or was it all a lot of fuss about nothing? And what are the lessons for the future?</p>
<p>When, in late March, residents of La Gloria, Mexico, began complaining of peculiar fevers, aches and sore throats, no one took much notice at first. The Mexican government, like the WHO, was focused on a different threat: bird flu. Following the re-emergence of the H5N1 avian virus in 2005, the WHO had drawn up a comprehensive pandemic plan, complete with a phased alert system, to be activated in the event that the virus, which had a mortality rate as high as 60 per cent, began spreading widely in human populations.</p>
<p>"The concern was that if bird flu suddenly went pandemic, it could trigger mortality on a massive scale," explains John Oxford, professor of virology at Barts and the London Hospital. "The last thing anyone was expecting at that point was a pig virus from Mexico."</p>
<p>It seems odd to recall now, but the massive stockpiles of Tamiflu which have come in for so much criticism were originally purchased for bird flu. Indeed, it wasn't until two children in California developed flu-like illnesses in mid-April that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta realized that a new swine flu virus was on the loose.</p>
<p>Scientists quickly began connecting the dots, and when the CDC confirmed that the H1N1 subtype from the California cases was identical to a virus isolated from a five-year-old boy in the La Gloria outbreak, it automatically triggered a "Phase 5" alert. At around the same time, the WHO published those new guidance notes, deleting the requirement that pandemic strains should cause "enormous morbidity and death."</p>
<p>This was part of an ongoing review of how it should define a pandemic. Henceforth, all that would be required was "sustained" transmission in at least two different parts of the world at the same time. The result was that on June 11, when it became clear that swine flu had spread to more than 70 countries, the WHO had no option but to declare a pandemic.</p>
<p>But Wendy Barclay, professor of virology at Imperial College London, who was present at many of the meetings where the change of definition was discussed, says it is "nonsense" to make out, as Wodarg does, that it was a conspiracy. "The timing was coincidental," she says. "The WHO was considering the change long before swine flu."</p>
<p>And in view of the initial reports from Mexico, which suggested unusual mortality patterns among young adults, she believes the WHO was right to call for the fast-track manufacture of vaccines. "The drug companies should be applauded for delivering the vaccines in record time," she says.</p>
<p>Peter Openshaw, the director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, agrees with that verdict, pointing out that the fear at the time was that swine flu could prove as deadly as the 1918 "Spanish" influenza, another strain of H1N1 that killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide. Although he has reservations about the definition change, saying that pandemics should also be required to meet a "severity threshold," he argues that "on balance it would have been irresponsible not to have taken the measures we did."</p>
<p>Having said that, Openshaw admits there are some things that should be done better next time. The Department of Health's prediction in July that as many as 65,000 Britons could die over the winter was wrong, because scientists did not have accurate data. Initial reports suggested the virus was less widespread than it was, artificially elevating the death rate. However, a study just published in The Lancet, based on more extensive tests conducted over the summer, shows that, at that time, as many as one in three people in Britain were carrying the virus, 10 times more than could be estimated from the data available from hospitals and surgeries. As a result, the fatality rate has now been downgraded to a paltry 0.03 per cent, meaning that swine flu is 100 times less lethal than Spanish flu. "What we didn't know at the time was that there were a large number of asymptomatic carriers," Openshaw explains.</p>
<p>Having said that, swine flu has tended to target people between the ages of 15 and 45, a group not normally at risk from seasonal flu, which has, the experts say, fully justified the National Health Service in Britain's decision to provide early treatment with Tamiflu. In the United States, Openshaw points out, those infected did not get antivirals until much later, and admissions of young adults to intensive care units have been far higher.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything, he believes we need to deliver vaccines even faster next time. That is a message seconded by Oxford, who points to the experience of Ukraine, where a surge in swine flu infections late last year brought the country's medical system to its knees and had politicians scrambling for vaccines.</p>
<p>Oxford also warns that the winter flu season is by no means over, and that vaccination could prove vital if, as he expects, H1N1 returns next year.</p>
<p>"Swine flu is behaving in classic Darwinian fashion," he says. "It has already displaced 99 per cent of the other flu viruses out there. My worry is that when it gets into the elderly next year, we could see many more deaths."</p>

</p>
<p>The flu, normally quite prevalent at this time of year, has virtually disappeared.</p>
<p>"It is extremely low," said Halton medical officer of health Dr. Bob Nosal, of the flu. "There is no outbreak in Halton or anywhere in Ontario. Flu activity, be it pandemic or seasonal, is extremely, extremely low."</p>
<p>In Hamilton, there have not been any cases of lab-confirmed seasonal flu since the start of the flu season in September and only two H1N1 cases since Jan. 1.</p>
<p>H1N1, the pandemic flu that exploded in the fall, peaking in late October and early November, has now pretty well fallen off the radar. There had been 8,787 confirmed Ontario cases this flu season.</p>
<p>Sporadic cases have continued in Ontario, but Nosal said there have been no confirmed H1N1 or seasonal flu cases in Halton in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>Doctors are, however, still seeing flu-like symptoms across Ontario.</p>
<p>Most are from the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes lung and breathing passage infections. It can cause pneumonia or bronchiolitis in the young and serious illness in the elderly, Nosal said.</p>
<p>"Right now, if people are having respiratory problems, I'd put my money on RSV."</p>
<p>Dr. Fiona Kouyoumdjian, a resident with Hamilton's public health department, said many who were immunized or had H1N1 already are protected.</p>
<p>Although Hamilton is seeing "quite a bit" of RSV -- about 30 to 40 per cent more than last year -- the levels are really back to normal because last year's cases were abnormally low, she said.</p>
<p>Halton has five outbreaks of RSV in nursing homes, and five from norovirus, a gastrointestinal illness, which is normal at this time of year, said Nosal. Hamilton has one nursing home RSV outbreak and six norovirus outbreaks, four in nursing homes and two in hospitals.</p>
<p>Ontario is experiencing an unusual mumps outbreak, with 73 confirmed cases since September, Kouyoumdjian said. Hamilton has had one confirmed case.</p>

<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>MAFIA GAVE ITALIAN PM HIS BIG BREAK</p>
<p>ROME - The Mafia invested heavily in a housing project that gave Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, his big break as a developer and enabled him to launch a successful political career, an Italian court has heard.</p>
<p>The allegation that Sicily's Cosa Nostra helped finance the project was made in a Palermo court by Massimo Ciancimino, the son of a Mafia don who was close to the head of the Sicilian mafia's "boss of bosses," Bernardo Provenzano.</p>
<p>He claimed that his father, Vito Ciancimino, along with two Mafiosi connected to the building industry, invested "dirty money" in Berlusconi's sprawling housing estate on the edge of Milan.</p>
<p>There has been intense speculation as to how the young Berlusconi, who came from a modest middle-class family, raised the capital to fund the construction of the ambitious 1970s apartment complex, known as Milano 2. Ciancimino told the court: "My father diversified his investments to evade anti-Mafia investigators. He considered the Milan mega project a bit pharaonic and he was hesitant, but then he decided to participate through various companies."</p>
<p>NEW EU LEADER ACTING LIKE A 'KING'</p>
<p>BRUSSELS - The new president of the European Union has been accused of having "delusions of grandeur" and acting like a "king" just a month into his tenure.</p>
<p>Herman Van Rompuy caused consternation in Brussels when he tried to hold his first EU summit, dedicated to greater "economic union," in a palace.</p>
<p>After pressure from Europe's capitals, Van Rompuy switched to another impressive, but less regal, building away from the usual office block venue where EU leaders meet. Diplomats are still predicting "chaos" when EU leaders meet next week in the ornate but badly equipped Bibliotheque Solvay, a cramped 100 year-old library that does not include interpretation booths.</p>
<p>BLAIR LIED TO CABINET ON IRAQ</p>
<p>LONDON - Tony Blair lied to his cabinet and misled Parliament over the war in Iraq, according to Clare Short, the former international development secretary.</p>
<p>Giving evidence at the Chilcot Inquiry, she accused the former prime minister of personally "conning" her, and of "deceiving" cabinet, parliament and the public. Short claimed that Blair broke the ministerial code by misleading parliament.</p>
<p>She accused Lord Goldsmith, the former attorney general who gave the "green light" to war, of failing to tell ministers the truth about his reservations over the legality of an invasion. "I think he misled the cabinet," she said.</p>
<p>"He certainly misled me. I think for the attorney general to come and say there's unequivocal legal authority to go to war was misleading."</p>
<p>ANTI-PIRACY FORCE WELCOMES CHINA</p>
<p>BRUSSELS - A commander of the European Union's naval force off Somalia's lawless coast welcomed Tuesday China's interest in playing a greater role in anti-piracy operations there.</p>
<p>"China is a new nation who's expressed real interest and an ambition to take on a wider role in counter-piracy and we very much welcome their involvement," EUNAVFOR operation commander Rear Admiral Peter Hudson told reporters.</p>
<p>Chinese state media reported last week that Beijing was in discussions to lead anti-piracy patrols in the waters off Somalia, where up to 35,000 ships transit each year.</p>
<p>China has been active in anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden, sending four flotillas to the area since late 2008.</p>
<p>DUTCH COFFEE SHOP TRIAL 'INADMISSIBLE'</p>
<p>MIDDELBURG, The Netherlands - The drug trafficking case against the owner of the Netherlands' biggest cannabis-vending coffee shop was "inadmissible," his lawyer told a Dutch court Tuesday.</p>
<p>Claiming several inconsistencies in the investigation of his client, defence lawyer Andre Beckers told the Middelburg district court in the southwest of the country that the case should be thrown out.</p>
<p>Meddy Willemsen, 58, is being prosecuted with 16 others, including a manager of his Checkpoint coffee shop in Terneuzen near the Belgian border and local suppliers, for allegedly having kept more than the permitted amount of cannabis on site.</p>
<p>Though technically illegal, the Netherlands decriminalized the consumption and possession of under five grams of cannabis in 1976 under a so-called "tolerance policy."</p>
<p>There are around 700 licensed coffee shops in the Netherlands which are allowed to keep no more than 500 grams of cannabis on their premises, though this limit is often flouted.</p>
<p>Investigators claim to have found 120 kilograms of cannabis on the premises of Willemsen's Checkpoint coffee shop in Terneuzen near the border with Belgium in 2007, and another 110 kilos in 2008.</p>
<p>NINE ARRESTED FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING</p>
<p>THE HAGUE - Belgian police arrested nine people of Iraqi origin Tuesday in raids on an international people smuggling network, mainly around the port city of Antwerp, policing agency Europol said.</p>
<p>"Those arrested belong to a network of criminals, mainly from Iraq, suspected of smuggling illegal immigrants from Belgium to the United Kingdom," it said in a statement in The Hague.</p>
<p>Europol said the network smuggled hundreds of immigrants, charging them $2,100 to be concealed in the back of trucks to be driven to Britain.</p>
<p>"The immigrants originated from countries such as Afghanistan, China, Iraq and Vietnam," said the statement.</p>
<p>They were brought to Europe by an Indian smuggling network, taken to so-called truck parks along the E40 route, including Dunkirk and Calais in France and Ghent in Belgium, from where they were loaded into lorries at night.</p>
<p>CZECH'S TOP SWINE FLU FOE TURNS VICTIM</p>
<p>PRAGUE - The Czech Republic's chief health officer has caught the disease he is fighting on a national scale -- the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Michael Vit told the online version of daily Hospodarske Noviny on Tuesday he had suffered from fever of up to 39 C, and has been in bed since Saturday. Vit said he believed he had the H1N1 version of flu, but would likely not seek laboratory confirmation.</p>
<p>"More than 90 per cent of flu in our country is caused by the pandemic, the so-called swine-flu virus, so it is probable that this is my case as well," the website www.ihned.cz[http://www.ihned.cz] quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Statue of Russian Empress Vandalized</p>
<p>KIEV - Unknown vandals in the Ukrainian city of Odessa defaced a statue of Russian empress Catherine II on Tuesday, five days ahead of a presidential election in the ex-Soviet country, Ukrainian media reported.</p>
<p>The vandals splashed red paint and wrote the words "Executioners of Ukraine" in the overnight attack on the statue of the 18th-century empress, also known as Catherine the Great, Interfax news agency reported.</p>
<p>A group calling itself "Unknown Patriots" claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement distributed to Ukrainian media outlets.</p>
<p>The previously unknown group said the statue should be replaced with a monument to Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera.</p>
<p>OVER 100 HELD IN BOSNIAN SERB RAIDS</p>
<p>BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Hercegovina - Scores of people were arrested Tuesday in a major operation against organized crime and drug trafficking in Bosnia's Serb entity Republika Srpska, police said.</p>
<p>More than 540 police took part in operation Network 2010, aimed at dismantling gangs dealing in drugs as well as stolen cars and contraband cigarettes, Bosnian Serb police chief Uros Pena told the Srna news agency.</p>
<p>Police made 102 arrests, with 10 set to appear in court, the official said. They also recovered automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition, cannabis, heroin and cocaine in raids across the entity.</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>MINISTER'S WIFE DENIES DRUG CHARGE</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - The wife of South Africa's intelligence minister denied Tuesday that she had knowingly taken part in drug trafficking, four days after her arrest in a cocaine running scandal.</p>
<p>Sheryl Cwele, wife of state security minister Siyabonga Cwele, is accused of conspiring with a Nigerian man to bring cocaine into South Africa by enlisting young white women as mules to travel overseas to collect the drugs.</p>
<p>"I wish to categorically state that I never knowingly participated in any drug trafficking, conspiracy or incitement to deal in drugs as set out in the indictment or at all," Cwele said Tuesday in a bail application filed with the provincial high court.</p>
<p>Cwele, a 50-year-old municipal director of health and community services, was arrested last week at her workplace.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>GORBACHEV GIVES OBAMA THUMBS UP</p>
<p>FARAYA, Lebanon - Despite slipping in U.S. opinion polls a year after his election, U.S. President Barack Obama still has the firm support of former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>At a news conference in Lebanon Tuesday, Gorbachev had kind words for fellow Nobel laureate Obama, as the U.S. relaunched talks with Russia on a nuclear disarmament treaty.</p>
<p>"The election of Obama was not an accident," Gorbachev said from the ski town of Faraya, northeast of the capital, where he was invited to give a lecture later Tuesday.</p>
<p>While he said that he liked Obama "a great deal," Gorbachev acknowledged the difficulties facing the president as he attempts to change his country's policies.</p>
<p>"U.S. policy is changing, but it's a difficult process," he said.</p>
<p>BODIES OF IRAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATED</p>
<p>BAGHDAD - The International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday nine Iranian soldiers killed in the war with Iraq in the 1980s had been repatriated, the second such handover.</p>
<p>"The families will finally be able to properly mourn the loss of their loved ones," said Rania Machlab, the ICRC delegate in charge of the missing persons file in Tehran, who witnessed the ceremony at Shalamjah border crossing, near Basra, Iraq's southernmost city.</p>
<p>The ICRC signed an agreement with both countries in October 2008 to collect and share information, to help repatriate mortal remains and to try to trace thousands of people still missing after the 1980-88 conflict.</p>
<p>ASIA</p>
<p>MALAYSIA OPPOSITION LEADER IN COURT</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia's opposition leader appeared in court Tuesday to face sodomy charges for the second time in a decade and threatened to call the prime minister as a witness.</p>
<p>Anwar Ibrahim said the charges were the result of "the machinations of a dirty, corrupt few." A 25-year-old former male aide, Saiful Bukhari, accused Anwar of sodomy.</p>
<p>He faces up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted -- a ruling that would effectively end the 62-year-old's political career. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Anwar's opposition coalition party poses the biggest threat to the National Front, which has ruled the country with an iron fist for 52 years.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1's worst over, health unit hopes</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>425 words</div><div>2 February 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health is hopeful the worst may be over for the area's pandemic H1N1 flu outbreak, though the season is far from over across the nation.</p>
<p>"We've had cases as late as the first week of June," medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer said Monday, referring to the experience last year in Canada. But she's somewhat more optimistic this year, particularly in our region.</p>
<p>H1N1 has been on the minds of Canadians much of the last year, particularly since last summer. That's when the World Health declared a pandemic when the flu strain spread from Mexico and the Southern U.S. to other countries, including Canada.</p>
<p>The disease comes in waves, or cycles. The first is a small wave like the one last spring, then a much higher second wave like the one that arrived in the fall. It's frequently followed by a smaller third wave, the severity of which depends on vaccination and immunity rates.</p>
<p>Guelph-area residents embraced vaccinations, with 97,000 doses distributed in public health's coverage area by early this year.</p>
<p>Others recovering from illness would also have built up immunities; with public health estimating 60 to 70 per cent of the region's population was protected.</p>
<p>"I can't say for sure there will not be a third wave, but the likelihood . . . is not as high," Mercer said, adding she's concluded the region has "fairly good population immunity."</p>
<p>If the third wave materializes, she suspects it'll come with a small rise of cases at the end of this month, for about four weeks or so.</p>
<p>Planning continues, with public health monitoring the situation closely for any signs of trouble. Though mass community clinics have ended, vaccinations are still available through public health offices, with information on the website www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org].</p>
<p>Mercer said her agency is still giving 25 to 35 inoculations a week and has added another nurse in case demand increases in the weeks ahead. Local physicians also have doses on hand and more are available from her health board as needed. If the worst is indeed over, Mercer stressed this is no time for complacency for those travelling to other areas where H1N1 may be more prevalent or the host populations less immune.</p>
<p>Those going to the Southern U.S. for March break, for example, would be wise to consider getting vaccinated, Mercer advised. "They may actually encounter this (less safe) environment."</p>

<p>I have been reading all kinds of negative things about prorogation of Parliament for 25 days, what would have been accomplished in 25 days?</p>
<p>More inquiries about the Afghanistan, prison issues. We had three generals testifying as well as one ambassador and many others. It was high time to close that circus down.</p>
<p>I think it's about time people put things in perspective. The truth is the opposition is upset because the prime minister has outsmarted them. They keep on saying that we can't trust Stephen Harper. They have been crying wolf for the last five years and I don't think Canadians believe them any longer.</p>
<p>I believe the Conservative party is doing a very good job and the opposition is concerned that the Conservatives might get a majority. The Liberals were in power for too long and they can't stand being in the opposition. They will do anything to make the Conservative party look bad.</p>
<p>The government has done many things they can be proud of, such as H1N1 flu crisis, Haiti disaster relief, restarting the economy, home renovation tax credit, to name a few. I'm proud of our prime minister and I'm not afraid to say so.</p>

</p>
<p>It had been one month between victory salutes to the Rexall Place fans for the Oilers, so there was no question this one was truly heartfelt.</p>
<p>After the Oilers snapped their winless streak at 13 games with a 4-2 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes on Monday night, those among the announced sellout crowd of 16,839 who stayed to the end gave the home side a standing ovation.</p>
<p>The Oilers returned the favour, clustering at centre ice and lifting their sticks in thanks.</p>
<p>As in, "For this relief, much thanks," for those with a theatrical jones. As in profound relief, on the players' side, that the streak didn't stretch to a franchise-record tying 14 games, let alone beyond.</p>
<p>"You know what, after all this, the Edmonton fans must be really something -- they are something!" Oilers head coach Pat Quinn said.</p>
<p>"The reception the players got after a month of frustration for them as well as for our guys was just awesome.</p>
<p>"That is one of the good feelings."</p>
<p>There was a fair amount of feel-good coming off the victory for the Oilers, who displayed more offensive snap than has too frequently been the case.</p>
<p>Marc Pouliot and J.F. Jacques each delivered a goal and an assist, while Gilbert Brule and Sam Gagner also scored. Mike Comrie (one assist) and Patrick O'Sullivan (two assists) also were among those who made things happen offensively.</p>
<p>Both of Carolina's goals were softies, the first coming at 2:42 of the opening period on a shot by Andrew Alberts, the second a Jussi Jokinen backhander that drifted past Jeff Deslauriers at 10:49 of the middle period, tying the game 2-2.</p>
<p>"It was a rough start, (them scoring) on the first shot, obviously," Deslauriers said. "But the more the game (progressed) I felt pretty good.</p>
<p>"The guys were battling pretty hard. They were putting a lot of pressure on them in the offensive zone.</p>
<p>"So it's always good for a goalie, knowing that the defencemen and the forwards were coming back in the zone and helping with my game.</p>
<p>"Everybody was helping each other. We need to take that and bring it to the next game."</p>
<p>That would be Wednesday against the Philadelphia Flyers, a far more robust team than the Hurricanes, or certainly far more physical than the Hurricanes played on Monday night, at any rate. They will present a stiffer test, without question.</p>
<p>Still, for a team as fragile as the Oilers, they'll take this one and enjoy it. After all, they were winless through January, with only one victory since Dec. 11 entering play Monday night. And that was against the Toronto Maple Leafs, who have since upgraded their roster considerably.</p>
<p>"It feels great to win this game," said Comrie, whose season-long frustrations have included bouts with H1N1 flu and mononucleosis.</p>
<p>"It's hard to explain how you feel after a game when the crowd cheers like that.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a relief cheer; we could tell they were genuinely happy."</p>
<p>No wonder. Oh, the Oilers had their lapses, including some nervous play in the third period when the Hurricanes mounted a push to try to draw even. But as the game wound down, the Oilers defended the two-goal advantage and gave their fans a chance to shower them with positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>"I thought that once we got the lead, we stayed pretty composed," Comrie said. "For the most part, we did a good job managing the puck and putting it in the proper places."</p>
<p>For the Oilers, it was nice having a lead for most of the game, although they did have to overcome that early 1-0 deficit.</p>
<p>"It gives you a sense of relief," Comrie said. "You go through a month like that, it's tough on everybody.</p>
<p>"When you do play well -- and there were a few games where we played well -- and you don't get the points, it's discouraging. I know we were playing the 28th team in the NHL, but at the same time, they were playing well. We did what we had to do to win."</p>
<p>To which Quinn added a heartfelt amen.</p>
<p>"It hasn't been easy and it certainly is not anything I expected to have happen to this hockey team," Quinn said.</p>
<p>"We've had rough times in each of the games and a lot of times we haven't held up. Tonight, we did have a couple of rough stretches, but every hockey player, every hockey game has rough stretches ... and you either break or you bend and come back.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we've found too many times to break. Tonight, we didn't. We bent a little bit, but we sustained good effort. We had a pretty good outing from our guys. We are channelling our goals now to a game-to-game basis and self-improvement."</p>
<p>Not to mention taking note of those still stuck in a rut of inconsistency.</p>
<p>"We're trying to reach certain people that have a future with this hockey club and build on the intangible attitude side, if you will, about what this business and game is all about," Quinn said.</p>
<p>"About being a team person and how to be better as a whole."</p>
<p>For the first time in a month, a building block to work with.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ounces Of Prevention; That's How Medcan Build Its Niche - And Defends It</b>
</div><div>Joanna Pachner   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>1112 words</div><div>2 February 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>44</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>On Halloween morning, the day after the Medcan Clinic began dispensing the swine-flu vaccine, CEO Shaun Francis discovered a TV crew in the lobby. They weren't trick-or-treating. The downtown Toronto clinic, which specializes in preventive treatments not covered by Ontario's provincial health plan, each year distributes the flu vaccine -- as all medical offices in Ontario are encouraged to do -- and its H1N1 vaccination program was no different. When Medcan alerted its patients that 3,000 doses had arrived, they made appointments and were in and out of the clinic, getting their shots within half an hour.</p>
<p>This wasn't a typical scenario. A severe shortage of the vaccine created hours-long line-ups in front of public health clinics. Amidst chaos and controversy, Medcan's orderly operation serving affluent executives in a luxuriously outfitted office sparked accusations of queue-jumping. For the next few days, with Medcan in national news, Francis and his staff had to manage the perception of scandal, even if, as he insists, it was manufactured by the media.</p>
<p>No doubt the story he'd rather have been telling was the one of how he, over the past six years, had grown Medcan into North America's largest health-management clinic -- a case study in the successful creation of a niche company made all the more remarkable by the fact that it operates in a sector where business and politics intermingle.</p>
<p>Like almost every doctor's office and diagnostic laboratory in Canada, Medcan is a private business. Where it differs is in its focus on non-essential medical services that the government doesn't cover, such as nutrition and fitness. Its core product is a $2,300 "comprehensive health assessment," a four-hour series of diagnostic tests, only a small fraction of which would be included in a typical check-up. The rest -- from major-organ ultrasounds to bone-density screens -- fall into the preventive category and aren't reimbursed by OHIP, Ontario's health-insurance program. "If you're sick, we'll take care of you, but that's not what we're in the business of," says Francis.</p>
<p>Medcan grew out of the medical practice Francis's father founded in the mid 1980s, which catered to executives working downtown. When Francis took over the</p>
<p>business in 2002, after stints on Wall Street as a trainee investment banker and with an American medical-supplies provider, he focused on expanding the clinic's premium services and staying out of the OHIP system. "More and more people want preventive health care, and more and more are unsatisfied with what government will reimburse," he says. "I never wanted to be in the health care business in this country that had to deal with government."</p>
<p>The company grew at 30% a year as it diversified into such services as personal training, sports medicine and cosmetic dermatology, all delivered in an environment closer to a spa than a doctor's office.</p>
<p>While Francis occasionally got questions about how Medcan co-existed with the public system, the company had not encountered controversy. In fact, media coverage it received focused on the "wellness story" around people, especially Baby Boomers, investing more in their health. When talking to reporters, Medcan staff always stressed that its deluxe services were elective, no different than massage therapy or cosmetic surgery. Still, of its more than 200 staff, 45 are physicians. "At the end of the day, we're a doctor's office," says Francis. Which is why Medcan spent months planning for H1N1. When it received its vaccine allotment, it offered it only to high-risk individuals as instructed by Toronto Public Health. "We did everything by the book," says Francis. So the TV ambush came as a surprise. He immediately sent his head of corporate affairs to speak with the reporters provided they stopped filming the patients. Which they did -- only to film them coming out and being ushered to their cars by valet-parking attendants. This was juicy stuff. "Shock of all shocks, how dare you provide valet parking to patients!" Francis recalls sarcastically. "They wanted to make it about class warfare."</p>
<p>As the story spread and the office was flooded with media calls, Francis designated a few staffers as spokespeople and asked employees to direct any questions to his PR representative. She, in turn, stressed that Medcan wasn't charging for the vaccine, that every clinic and doctor could have prepared for the onslaught just as Medcan had. But the key message was that the term "private clinic" was a red herring -- all doctor's offices are private businesses.</p>
<p>Over five days, the story evolved. The editor of a major Toronto newspaper wrote about his experience getting the H1N1 shot at Medcan and clarifying confusion. By the end, says Francis, "the media were advocating for us." Nevertheless, he says, "only in Canada would it be controversial that you weren't keeping your customers waiting." But he adds, "if you're going to be notorious for something, it might as well be for good customer service."</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>FRANCIS: TENDING YOUR NICHE</p>
<p>1] EVANGELIZE. Since Medcan's business defies some people's assumptions about Canadian health care, it's been critical to have a clear, succinct message about how the clinic comfortably -- and legally-- co-exists with public medicare. "People don't understand how the public system works," says Bronwen Evans, Medcan's VP of corporate affairs, "and they're sometimes surprised that this other option exists."</p>
<p>2] CHERISH REFERRALS. To attract individual clients -- who comprise one-third of Medcan's patient roll -- the clinic has long relied on word-of-mouth as a core promotion strategy. While Francis has beefed up marketing and added a sales force targeting corporate accounts, keeping existing patients satisfied has been critical to successful expansion. Medcan's key tool on that front is customer satisfaction research. The most important metric is whether clients say they'd recommend the clinic to friends. "Those people are our ambassadors," says Francis.</p>
<p>3] KNOW YOUR NICHE. Francis has focused on diversifying Medcan's premium offerings while staying away from standard doctor's office services. "We're solely focused on this one niche, and no one is really in this [to that degree] even in North America," he says. As a result, Medcan can boast of being the biggest executive health clinic on the continent, doing more comprehensive health assessments than even the large U.S. hospitals -- a valuable marketing claim.</p>

<p>Olympic goers get free H1N1 shots</p>
<p>Forget the Olympic pins. The hot souvenir at the Vancouver Olympics will be the swine flu shot.</p>
<p>British Columbia's chief medical officer of health says any Olympic athlete, official or tourist is welcome to get an H1N1 shot. Officials will direct people who want flu shots to pharmacists who can provide them.</p>

<p>Dr. John Walker of St. Boniface Hospital in Manitoba says anxiety at exam time is a clinical problem if it causes you a lot of distress or affects functioning.</p>

<p>Memory stronger when the mind rests</p>
<p>When you learn something new, it's often suggested that you take a little time to let it sink in.</p>
<p>This advice assumes new meaning in a study published this week in the journal Neuron. The study says that with time, memories become consolidated, stronger and more resistant to being forgotten.</p>
<p>"There's very good evidence that this kind of ... consolidation of memory happens during sleep," said senior author Lila Davachi of New York University.</p>
<p>The study data suggest that moments of relative rest during the day -- taking a walk, having a coffee break -- might also encourage memory formation, she says.</p>

<div>VANCOUVER 2010 / HEALTHY LIVING / ILLNESS PREVENTION</div>
<div>Sports: Olympic Games</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Before going for gold, Olympians gear up against germs; A vital part of athletes' training regimens includes flu shots, surgical masks, sanitizers and supplements – anything to prevent a performance-crippling bout of illness</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO AND SEAN GORDON   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO and MONTREAL -- They have logged thousands of hours training in gyms, on fields and on the ice, transforming their bodies into finely tuned machines fit to conquer the greatest of sports competitions.</p>
<p>But in the final lead-up to the Games, they also practice stealthy evasion of the invisible microbes that threaten to cripple performances with fevers, runny noses or, worse, a full-blown flu.</p>
<p>What's in their arsenal of prevention?</p>
<p>Flu shots, surgical masks, Cold-FX, supplements, hand sanitizers – even sleeping pills. There are also power naps and, most importantly, efforts not to get too stressed about the possibility of falling ill.</p>
<p>“All I can do is just try to be healthy and eat well, and if I get sick, that's just going to really suck,” says Canadian snowboarder Michael Lambert. “But being paranoid about it isn't going to help me.”</p>
<p>By no means a germophobe, Mr. Lambert still takes Cold-FX to keep himself healthy. Travel, after all, goes hand in hand with a host of viruses. He remains vigilant about his diet on the road, and takes sleeping pills in the first few nights when he flies to Europe or Asia to make sure he gets proper rest.</p>
<p>But when he's home, “I don't schedule anything before 12,” he says, which allows his body to wake up when it wants to. “With the amount of abuse we go through on the road, I think it's so important to take the time when we're at home to do everything we can to get healthy again. That's the way I see my time off at home.”</p>
<p>Kelly Anne Erdman, lead dietitian for the Canadian Sport Centre in Calgary and a nutritional consultant for Olympic-bound athletes, says her role is to educate them on healthy living habits, especially in the run-up to a world-stage event where their stress level climbs by the day. Sports psychologists work with athletes to manage the pressure, and nutritionists remind them to keep their diets consistent.</p>
<p>“When the athletes are performing, their bodies are obviously under stress. There's the psychological stress plus they are bombarded with all the germs that have come in from all over the world,” Ms. Erdman says. “It's a constant for athletes: How can they stay healthy?”</p>
<p>For Canada's short-track speed-skating squad, one of the ways to keep the flu bug at bay is wearing masks in airports and on planes.</p>
<p>Yves Hamelin, the team leader, says the team revisited its procedures after a 2007 World Cup trip to Asia where 14 of the 17 people on hand picked up a stomach bug – “everyone was sick, and not just a little bit.”</p>
<p>The athletes have been inoculated against H1N1 and seasonal flu. The upshot is that no one on the short-track team has caught the flu yet this year, although a handful have had colds.</p>
<p>Because the skaters' diets are carefully mapped out as part of their training regimen, the team also brings nuts, oatmeal, dried fruits and granola bars on the road. On longer trips it totes peanut butter, jam and hazelnut spread.</p>
<p>“When we travel, we usually bring a pantry full of food along to make sure there's no difference with their usual dietary habits,” Mr. Hamelin says. “We wash doorknobs, sinks, faucets, the television remote. We wash it all with Purell or a disinfectant. That's where contamination occurs most often. … In the airport and on the plane they wear masks so they're protected.”</p>
<p>The women's hockey team hasn't gone to such drastic measures. Sure, there are those like defenceman Becky Kellar, 35, who carry hand sanitizer in their knapsacks. But the team's strength and conditioning coach, Ryan van Asten, says it's impossible to keep germs out. In the meantime, the team maintains its healthy living strategies – promoting eating every two to three hours and getting plenty of rest – in the weeks before the Games, hoping no one gets ill.</p>
<p>“We try to educate them as much as possible,” Mr. van Asten says. “If their nutrition is lacking, their risk of getting sick is going to go up. If they're not sleeping, their risk of getting sick is going up. All throughout the year, we try to educate them on how to minimize their risk of getting sick and being as healthy as they can, so that they can perform at their best at the right time.”</p>
<p>Staying healthy is all well and good. But athletes, like the rest of us, have their cheats. For Mr. Lambert, it's a particular brand of chocolate ice-cream.</p>
<p>“I try to make the best choices that I can most of the time,” the snowboarder says. And the ice-cream? “That keeps me happy. For my mental wellness, it's Haagen-Dazs.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Don't blame WHO for H1N1 cock-up; The real scandal was poor vaccine distribution to Third World countries</b>
</div><div>Thomas Abraham   </div>
<div>International Herald Tribune</div>
<div>814 words</div><div>1 February 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Not for the first time, the World Health Organization is under fire for its handling of the current H1N1 influenza pandemic. Initially, it was criticized for being too slow to alert the world when the disease, often called swine flu, first broke out in Mexico. Now, the organization faces a diametrically opposite charge: that it was influenced by the pharmaceutical industry to create a false pandemic when none existed, so that drug companies could sell more vaccines.</p>
<p>The WHO's critics are barking up the wrong tree. This is a real influenza pandemic, not an imaginary disease cooked up by public health agencies around the world and the pharmaceutical industry. Though for the vast majority of people the disease has been mild, it has killed small children, pregnant mothers and otherwise healthy teenagers.</p>
<p>This is not an innocuous disease. Take a look at the lungs of those whom it as killed: The virus has turned them into a wasteland of devastated tissue, in a way that the normal flu virus never can.</p>
<p>The world has been fortunate that this virus has not mutated to cause more severe illness in larger numbers of people. This could still happen. In China, in less than a month's time, one of the world's great annual movements of people will take place as millions travel to their hometowns for the Chinese lunar new year. Travel and the movement of people provides opportunities for the virus to spread to new environments and change to a more lethal form in the process. The changing flu seasons that see the focus of outbreaks move from the northern to the southern hemisphere, and then back again to the northern hemisphere later in the year, also bring risks of the virus changing to a more severe form.</p>
<p>The non-debate over whether there is a new type of flu sweeping the world has detracted from a real issue: The world's poorest countries have yet to receive the vaccine they were promised, while many of the world's rich countries are wondering what to do with vaccine supplies their citizens do not want.</p>
<p>Ninety per cent of the world's influenza vaccine production is concentrated in Europe and North America. With production well short of demand, governments in these countries had contracts in place to buy the bulk of the first year's production. Most poor and middle income countries (with the exception of countries like China, which has built up its vaccine production capacity) would have had to wait for at least a year for their first supplies.</p>
<p>If this pandemic had rapidly gained lethality and killed several millions of people, the imbalance in the supply of vaccine would have caused a major rift in society between those who had access to vaccines and those who did not. While those who lived in the world's rich countries would have been largely protected, the majority of the world's population would have borne the brunt of the pandemic, exposing the fault lines that divide the haves from the have-nots in today's globalized world.</p>
<p>To try to bring fairness to vaccine distribution, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and the WHO director general, Margaret Chan, met with the heads of major vaccine manufacturers last June, and received a pledge that they would devote 10 per cent of their first year's production for distribution to countries that would otherwise not have any supplies.</p>
<p>The WHO put together a list of 95 countries that should have received emergency supplies of vaccines, beginning late last autumn. But it was only in January that supplies trickled through to the first three countries: Mongolia, Azerbaijan and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Legal and administrative hurdles, regulatory issues and logistic problems have meant that the WHO has been unable to deliver vaccines to developing countries at the time they most needed them, when the disease was peaking. Even had they received vaccine supplies, many countries were ill-equipped and ill-prepared to distribute the vaccines, revealing the weaknesses in health systems across the world.</p>
<p>The Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly has held an emergency debate into the "false pandemic" that the WHO declared ostensibly under the influence of the pharmaceutical industry. Wolfgang Wodarg, the chairman of the subcommittee on health in the council's parliamentary assembly, has described the declaration of the pandemic as one of the greatest medical scandals of the century. The real scandal that should be investigated is the inequity in pandemic vaccine distribution.</p>
<p>Thomas Abraham heads the public health communication program at the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Studies Centre, and was working at the WHO when the pandemic was declared last year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Toronto's champion of affordable housing; Candidate is running strongly on tenant issues, where renters make up three-quarters of riding's residents</b>
</div><div>David Hayes    </div>
<div>Special to the Star</div>
<div>1049 words</div><div>30 January 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>CL08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>At the question-and-answer session during an all-candidates' meeting at Regent Park Community Centre last Thursday, Cathy Crowe ducked as the exuberant, voluble and digression-prone independent candidate to her left gesticulated wildly while making a point about Canadian currency and Japan. Not exactly a bread-and-butter issue in Regent Park, but all-candidates' meetings are democracy in action. When her turn came, Crowe - the NDP candidate for Toronto Centre - stood and told a folksy story:</p>
<p>"In December I was walking up Sherbourne St. and got really sick and tired of what I was seeing. It was a cold, rainy, yucky day and I was walking to the Regent Park health centre to get my H1N1 shot. I looked around and didn't see something new that day, but I saw things differently. I saw affordable housing in disrepair. Empty blocks sitting where affordable housing could have been built if we had the money... I saw a huge waste of our precious dollars..."</p>
<p>A public health nurse, Crowe worked in the downtown area and became increasingly angry at the scope of homelessness in Canada's largest and most prosperous city. (A homeless man once described her as a "street nurse" and that's what people call her to this day.) She has been a persistent supporter of affordable housing, the kind of advocate who, like a coach hearing the softest whisper of defeat in the locker-room, launches into a rousing pep talk at the suggestion that there are impediments to providing everyone with clean, decent, well-managed homes.</p>
<p>"We propose a 'One Per Cent Solution'," she had told me earlier. "All levels of government would spend 1 per cent of their overall budgets on housing. That would result in $2 billion in new funding for social housing every year from the federal government and another $2 billion shared among the provinces and territorial governments."</p>
<p>Shelter is a basic need and affordable housing strikes many of us to be a right, not a privilege. Yet a 2006 United Nations report described homelessness in Canada as a "national emergency" and the Toronto Community Foundation's study, Toronto Vital Signs 2009, pointed out that access to affordable housing in this city is increasingly out-of-reach. More than 200,000 households are in "core housing need" (defined as living in inadequate, unsuitable and unaffordable housing) and more than 100,000 residents pay 50 per cent or more of their income in rent. And, in the mid-'90s, there were two low-income families for every moderate rental unit; today that number has risen to seven families for each unit.</p>
<p>But the inalienable rights of property owners to profit from their rental income is also considered sacrosanct in a society where moral issues often seem to bear an inverse relationship to profit margins. And housing, more than any other issue, is where the battle lines will be drawn in Thursday's provincial by-election in the Toronto Centre riding.</p>
<p>Toronto Centre is perhaps the city's quintessential riding. It's a mix of high income (Rosedale), low income (St. Jamestown, Regent Park), the gay village at Church and Wellesley, and the condos and coops at the southern end. Renters make up three-quarters of the riding's residents, and 42 per cent are immigrants. It's a multicultural and socio-cultural mashup.</p>
<p>And if you need further evidence why Prime Minister Stephen Harper doesn't focus much attention on downtown Toronto, consider the slate of candidates. Glen Murray, the openly gay former mayor of Winnipeg, is known for his work in the non-profit sector and for having a special interest in affordable housing issues. (Not to mention being hand-picked by Premier McGuinty to represent the Liberals in this bid to replace high-profile former Liberal MPP George Smitherman.) The Conservative candidate is Pamela Taylor, who campaigns like an old-school red Tory (although she's burdened by her association with Conservative leader Tim Hudak, described by many as "Mike Harris 2.0").</p>
<p>Although she's widely regarded as being genuine and earnest, Crowe's potential weakness is that some try to paint her as a one-issue candidate who's campaigning mainly on homelessness and affordable housing. Does that matter in a riding, and at a time, when housing is the No. 1 issue?</p>
<p>"It was certainly on my mind when I agreed to run," admits the 57-year-old Crowe after the Regent Park meeting. Although she briefly owned a house years ago, she's been a renter most of her life. She's now sitting in the living room of her tidy two-bedroom apartment in a St. Lawrence Neighbourhood coop.</p>
<p>"It was interesting preparing for the two all-candidates' meetings that have been held. I was reflecting on my entire career and realized that I've been involved in many important health-care issues. I was among the first nurses in the city to treat patients with AIDS, before we even knew it was HIV, and more recently I joined with (provincial NDP leader) Andrea Horwath pushing for more hospital funding."</p>
<p>Pausing, she added, "And I was involved in environmental issues caused by incinerators when I worked at the South Riverdale Health Centre. And education issues around child care. There are so many social justice and human rights issues I've been part of over the years."</p>
<p>But, yes, along with the new harmonized sales tax and health care, housing is the hot subject in Toronto Centre.</p>
<p>"And it carries across the riding," says Crowe. "Even in affluent areas people are concerned about affordable housing and homelessness. It's really one of the defining issues of our time."</p>

<p>On Thursday the Provincial Medical Health Officer Dr. Perry Kendall advised the 60 per cent of British Columbians who have not yet been vaccinated against the H1N1 flu strain to go and get their shot.</p>
<p>Roger Swetnam took him at his word and contacted his family doctor who said he didn't want to crack open a 10-shot vial of vaccine just to administer one shot and have the rest go to waste. An opened vial of vaccine has a shelf life of 24 hours.</p>
<p>"I was told I'd need 10 people," said Swetnam who wants the shot before travelling to Australia in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Swetnam called two clinics and received the same message. He has since found a walk-in clinic which said they will give him the vaccine today. "I didn't think I'd have this much trouble getting vaccinated. I think the public health people should make it easier for people to get vaccinated," he said</p>
<p>His wife Maria wasn't impressed. "I don't think the Australians would appreciate it if we brought H1N1 with us when we seem to have an excess of vaccine in B.C.," she said.</p>
<p>Kendall said he sympathized with Swetnam but could understand why a physician wouldn't want to let a vial of vaccine worth $80 go to waste.</p>
<p>He expects clinics dispensing the vaccine to organize a registry so that when people call they would be put on a list and given a time when the vaccine would be administered. "I can understand it's frustrating but it would cost $80 per person if the vaccine was dispensed just once. My advice is not to waste vaccine," he said.</p>
<p>Kendall has said health authorities want as many people as possible to get the vaccine to ensure there would not be a "third wave" appearance of H1N1 flu which has taken 55 lives in B.C. since it showed up here in May.</p>

</p>
<p>Amid a nationwide frenzy over the coming Winter Games, there remains a group of people desperate to duck Olympic fever: the athletes.</p>
<p>The results of a poll of Canadian Olympic competitors, released exclusively to Canwest News Service, suggest eight in 10 Olympians feared coming down with a cold or flu during the Games.</p>
<p>The anxiety isn't unfounded, with fully 60 per cent of winter athletes having previously battled an illness that negatively affected their performance in competition.</p>
<p>Given that the Olympics are, historically, a giant Petri dish of contagions, with hundreds of thousands of visitors arriving from more than 80 countries, event insiders are going to radical lengths to ensure the only fever that spreads is patriotic.</p>
<p>"Athletes sometimes have a gladiator mentality, like, 'That can't happen to me,' " says Dr. Bob McCormack, the Canadian Olympic team's head doctor.</p>
<p>"But when the consequences of getting ill are this significant -- they've trained for 10 to 12 years for one crack at the biggest stage in the world, against the best in the world -- we've got to do everything we can to minimize risks."</p>
<p>Half of the athletes surveyed said they take daily natural supplements, while nearly three-quarters take the immune-booster Cold-FX. Fifty-three per cent have either received or plan to receive the H1N1 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition, Canada's Olympic hopefuls have access to a multi-disciplined team of physicians, therapists, nutritionists, chiropractors, osteopaths and sport psychologists, all sharing the goal of preventing illness and injury.</p>
<p>"The traditional model was that if somebody got sick or hurt, we tried to put the pieces back together," says McCormack. "But more and more, we're working in a proactive, preventive way."</p>
<p>International delegates have the option of receiving the H1N1 flu vaccine upon arrival in Canada, while the shot -- along with the seasonal vaccine -- has already been offered to volunteers and professional staff.</p>
<p>Starting this week, a hepatitis vaccine will be available to all food handlers, who in turn, will be monitored by public health officers posted throughout Olympic venues.</p>
<p>Daily reports are being submitted to the International Olympic Committee on everything from air quality -- to protect those with respiratory conditions -- to the current state of health in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and the world.</p>
<p>And hand-sanitizer will be placed at work stations, entrances to food areas and athlete residences, and inside bathrooms.</p>
<p>"We're trying to be as comprehensive as possible," says Dr. Jack Taunton, chief medical officer of the 2010 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>He notes that special attention is being given to the Games' workforce in light of a historic trend that's seen staff and volunteers represent 50 to 55 per cent of medical incidents.</p>
<p>Among the efforts: A human kinetics team from the University of British Columbia measured the energy costs of doing everything from shovelling snow to marshalling participants up a steep grade, then ran workers through a computer program that measured their ability to perform those tasks without incident.</p>
<p>Those who weren't physically up to their assigned or desired job then completed a 12-week exercise program that ultimately saw the average participant's fitness improve by 30 per cent.</p>
<p>Given these unprecedented health and safety measures, it's no wonder 92 per cent of surveyed athletes expect Canada to set a new Olympic medal record at next month's games, with 70 per cent attributing their confidence to the home advantage.</p>

<p>With 40 per cent of B. C's population immunized against the H1N1 flu virus, provincial health authorities are hoping there will be no significant "third wave" outbreak of the flu within the next few months.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, the B.C. Medical Health Officer, said Thursday that the province had a plentiful supply of H1N1 vaccine and persons not yet vaccinated should have the jab in order to reduce the likelihood of a third wave.</p>
<p>With the Olympics about to begin and with the hundreds of thousands of visitors, athletes and media coming to Vancouver, persons not yet immunized should do so, he said.</p>
<p>"This vaccine will offer long-lasting protection and is a good insurance policy," said Kendall, adding that vaccinations will be available to Olympic visitors.</p>
<p>The first wave of infections occurred in May last year with the second more serious wave peaking in late October. Kendall said the virus caused 55 deaths in B.C. with 1,032 persons hospitalized -- 20 per cent of whom needed intensive care. Most of the persons affected were under the age of 20. There have been no deaths reported in the last week.</p>
<p>B.C. put aside $80 million to fight H1N1, which was labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization -- the first flu pandemic in 40 years, he said.</p>
<p>The province purchased 4.3 million doses of vaccine. About 750,000 doses have since been loaned to Mexico, with half a million doses being stored by the BC Centre for Disease Control and a quarter of a million doses still being held by physicians, pharmacists and clinics.</p>
<p>The province also purchased almost 1.9 million doses of antiviral medication for people to treat their symptoms at home. Kendall credited the use of antivirals along with the public's acceptance of frequent handwashing, staying home when sick and coughing into their arms with reducing the spread of H1N1. B. C's immunization rate was less than some provinces, such as Quebec, which had 57 per cent of their population immunized, but the rate among the province's first nations was more than 70 per cent. Kendall said this was due to the work of the First Nations Health Council and band chiefs making great efforts to immunize as many band members as possible.</p>
<p>Minister of Healthy Living and Sport Ida Chong paid tribute to B.C.'s medical and health care workers for their part in controlling the outbreak.</p>
<p>"Those involved in public health can be extremely proud knowing how they worked together to protect the people of B.C. from H1N1," said Chong.</p>

<p>Re: Meat inspectors give food agency a failing grade, Jan. 28.</p>
<p>Six months ago, Agricultural Minister Gerry Ritz said he welcomed the idea of new food safety legislation as a way to implement the 57 recommendations made by investigator Sheila Weatherill, in her report handed down last July 21 after the previous summer's deadly listeriosis tragedy, which left 22 dead and others seriously ill. Don't bet on this happening.</p>
<p>The public health and safety of Canadians is not and has never been high on the agenda of this government. Its record of failure and indifference speaks for itself when it comes to food safety, product safety, aviation safety, rail safety and the isotope debacle. The jury is still out on its response to the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>A case in point. The report into the sad state of rail safety was tabled in the House of Commons on March 7, 2008. The inadequate response by the federal government to that report speaks for itself.</p>
<p>The report presented more than 50 recommendations to improve rail safety in Canada. Well more than a year later, not one of those recommendations has been implemented by Transport Canada.</p>
<p>Weatherill's report awaits the same fate.</p>
<p>This is a case of political ideology and budget considerations trumping public health and safety.</p>

<p>Toronto -- Canada will donate five million doses of H1N1 vaccine to the World Health Organization as demand wanes among Canadians.</p>
<p>The federal government said the donation will help the international agency redistribute the vaccine to developing countries that couldn't afford their own supplies. Earlier this month, Canada lent five million doses of the vaccine to Mexico. Until yesterday, the federal government remained mum on what it would do with the rest of its excess supply.</p>
<p>The government ordered 50.4 million doses from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> when it was believed that each person needed two shots. Subsequent clinical trials determined only one dose would be needed.</p>

</p>
<p>There could be a third wave of H1N1 infection in B.C. -- but the province's chief medical health officer thinks the chances of that happening are "diminishing."</p>
<p>Before issuing a final report next week, Dr. Perry Kendall joined Ida Chong, the Minister for Healthy Living and Sport, Thursday to offer the media a last comprehensive update on the influenza pandemic that proved less deadly than expected.</p>
<p>Kendall stressed repeatedly that the need for continuing vaccinations remains, but was optimistic about the flu fight being over for now.</p>
<p>"I personally feel the risk of a third wave is diminishing," said Kendall, who nonetheless hedged his bets. "Influenza is unpredictable," he said. If the disease was to come back, "it would occur a couple of months after the last wave," he added.</p>
<p>The peak of the second wave came in the last week of October.</p>
<p>There are usually 400 to 800 deaths associated with the flu annually in the province, mostly in the elderly.</p>
<p>There were just 55 deaths positively linked to H1N1, but the disease differed from typical flu bugs in that it affected younger people.</p>
<p>Kendall estimated that about 25 per cent of the province was actually infected with H1N1, but noted the effects were less severe than other flu strains and there was also a significant distribution of anti-viral drugs to treat the illness.</p>
<p>There have not been any severe H1N1 cases reported since Jan. 19, and since April of 2009 the total of severe cases was 1,032.</p>
<p>B.C. is prepared if there is another wave of H1N1. The province ordered 4.2 million doses of the vaccine, enough to cover the entire population.</p>
<p>An exact total of how many doses were administered was not available, but Kendall said about 38 to 40 per cent of B.C. was vaccinated.</p>
<p>About 750,000 doses have been loaned to Mexico and will be replaced when that country's production ramps up.</p>
<p>Another 500,000 doses are at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and another 250,000 are distributed around the province.</p>
<p>The provincial government set the budget for the entire H1N1 program in B.C. at $80 million. That total includes everything from the vaccine and the clinics to paying for doctors to take calls about the flu, and has not been exceeded.</p>
<p>Chong thanked everyone in the health sector for fighting the disease.</p>
<p>"These are people that rose to the occasion," she said.</p>

</div><div>By Ross Marowits   </div>

</p>
<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>International air traffic suffered its worst postwar demand decline last year amid the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression, an industry association said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Passenger demand dropped 3.5 per cent while scheduled carriers flew 75.6 per cent full, said the International Air Transport Association.</p>
<p>Cargo demand suffered an even bigger hit, falling 10.1 per cent, with an average load factor of 49.1 per cent.</p>
<p>"In terms of demand, 2009 goes into the history books as the worst year the industry has ever seen," said IATA director general Giovanni Bisignani.</p>
<p>He said the airline industry has lost 2.5 years of growth in the passenger market and 3.5 years in the freight business.</p>
<p>The situation started to improve in recent months, but the association expects international carriers will lose $5.6 billion US in 2010.</p>
<p>IATA represents some 230 airlines comprising 93 per cent of scheduled international air traffic. Its statistics don't include domestic traffic.</p>
<p>International passenger demand increased by 4.5 per cent in December and planes flew 77.6 per cent full as capacity fell 0.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Demand marked an 8.4 per cent improvement from the February low point, but was still 3.4 per cent below the early 2008 peak.</p>
<p>Revenues per passenger mile flown have started to improve following capacity reductions, but remained five to 10 per cent below 2008 levels.</p>
<p>"Revenue improvements will be at a much slower pace than the demand growth that we are starting to see," Bisignani said, noting that profitability will be even slower to recover.</p>
<p>The industry also faces a renewed security challenge from the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a Detroit-bound airline. Bisignani described the Obama administration's approach to security as encouraging but said airlines spend $5.9 billion US annually for what is essentially national security.</p>
<p>"This is the responsibility of governments, and they should be picking up the bill."</p>
<p>Seasonally adjusted demand figures for December increased 1.6 per cent from November, while freight demand was almost flat.</p>
<p>Carriers in North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe recorded the largest year-over-year declines in passenger demand of 5.6, 5.0 and 5.6 per cent respectively in 2009.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific carriers saw the largest up tick in December with an eight per cent improvement.</p>
<p>North American carriers declined by 0.4 per cent, while European carriers decreased 1.2 per cent in December.</p>
<p>Middle Eastern carriers generated the fastest growth in passenger traffic at the end of the year with a 19.1 per cent increase in December, and 11.2 per cent growth for the entire year.</p>
<p>Latin American carriers saw demand increase by 7.1 per cent in December even though the impact of the H1N1 virus constrained full-year traffic growth by 0.3 per cent.</p>
<p>Freight demand increased by 24.4 per cent in December over a very weak period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Increasing optimism by purchasing managers pointed to freight volumes in the coming months.</p>
<p>"The industry starts 2010 with some enormous challenges. The worst is behind us, but it is not time to celebrate," added Bisignani.</p>
<p>"Adjusting to 2.5-3.5 years of lost growth means that airlines face another spartan year focused on matching capacity carefully to demand and controlling costs."</p>

</p>
<p>Well, it looks like I'll be sending back my 2009 Father and Husband of the Year awards. I simply can't accept them. I don't deserve them.</p>
<p>For about a week now I've wrestled with what I encouraged my wife and 18-month-old daughter to subject themselves to.</p>
<p>It was early November. I was scared. I'll admit it. And, chances are, you were likely at least little concerned too.</p>
<p>I had just finished covering in depth the tragic death of Nicholas Henry Klassen.</p>
<p>Klassen was a recent university grad. He was in love. He wanted to be prime minister one day.</p>
<p>He also was the first person in Guelph to succumb to complications associated with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu killed him. I wrote about it.</p>
<p>In order to tell his tale, I had to speak with his grieving mother Susan, who at times held back tears and sobs.</p>
<p>At times, I did my best to do the same. She found her son dead on his bed early one morning. Some stories are not easy to research and write.</p>
<p>No one should have to lose their son or daughter. Not to the H1N1 flu. Not to anything.</p>
<p>But Susan did. And during the media hype, hysteria and hoopla surrounding H1N1, of which I was now a part, I felt the same could happen to me, my wife or my daughter at any given moment.</p>
<p>I was essentially the last man on the planet to be considered for vaccination. A less-than-middle-aged male, reasonably healthy, no underlying medical conditions I was aware of. To the end of the long, long line I went.</p>
<p>After months of diligence, debate and a gut feeling I had, I thought it best for us to avoid the vaccination altogether.</p>
<p>And then I told Klassen's story. And then I made a rash decision.</p>
<p>I encouraged my pregnant wife and daughter to stand in that line and get vaccinated, after work and without dinner one rainy day in November.</p>
<p>I decided to encourage my two best girls to inject themselves with a drug seemingly rushed to market by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, a Canadian company to which the federal government awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to produce the drug and to which Ottawa promised "indemnify." That is immunity against legal action should you or I ever suffer any harm from the vaccination.</p>
<p>Now, I read suggestions the entire pandemic, much like the drug used to combat it, may have been manufactured.</p>
<p>Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, health chief at the Council of Europe, told the European press, "We have had a mild flu - and a false pandemic."</p>
<p>Wodarg pushed for an investigation into the so-called pandemic. His wish was granted.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Council of Europe launched an investigation into whether the WHO "faked" the pandemic in order to increase drug companies' profits.</p>
<p>It's been reported GlaxoSmithKine saw its earnings rise 30 per cent to $2.19 billion, by the way.</p>
<p>Wodarg called the H1N1 scare "one of the greatest medical scandals of the century."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I feel I was duped and my wife, daughter and unborn child may someday pay the price.</p>

</p>
<p>T he federal government was to announce today that Canada is donating five million doses of its excess H1N1 vaccine to the World Health Organization, Canwest News Service has learned.</p>
<p>The announcement is set to come a day after the Public Health Agency of Canada declared the second wave of the pandemic over.</p>
<p>The United Nations agency is coordinating the donation of vaccine for 95 developing countries and until now, Canada had not indicated whether it would give away some of its pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>Canada ordered 50.4 million doses of vaccine and it was apparent before the end of 2009 that it would have a surplus on its hands. At the time the order was placed, it wasn't known that only one dose of the vaccine would be sufficient to provide immunity.</p>
<p>Federal officials have been saying for weeks that they were reviewing several options and would make an announcement some time in the new year on what Canada would do with the excess supply.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq is expected to make the announcement about the vaccine donation Thursday. Shipments of the vaccine should begin moving quickly because Canada's entire order has already been filled by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> and is being stored at the company's plant in Ste-Foy, Que.</p>
<p>While the prevalence of H1N1 has waned in Canada, it's still going strong in parts of eastern Europe, South Asia and North Africa and countries in those regions are expected to be on the receiving end of Canada's donation.</p>
<p>Canada took its time announcing it would make the donation. Other nations, including the United States, Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom made a commitment to donate vaccine in September.</p>

</p>
<p>Battered and bruised by weeks of unrelenting public criticism, transit officials yesterday apologized, accepted the blame and vowed to do better.</p>
<p>"We owe our riders an apology," a grim TTC chair Adam Giambrone told a news conference at city hall yesterday.</p>
<p>"They have a right to expect good quality, reliable and customer-friendly service," he said, adding that the avalanche of public vitriol has "acted as a wake-up call."</p>
<p>It was classic damage control. And it was well done. But will it work?</p>
<p>We'll see how effective the proposed changes will be, especially the promise to do what they admit is a most difficult task: change the culture of transit staff to put customers first.</p>
<p>At stake is more than the mood of an apoplectic public. After a while, people just give up complaining, begin to accept bad service and either stomach it or move away from transit, slowly.</p>
<p>The greater risk is a political one for Giambrone. The transit file, once thought to be his passport to the mayor's office, now threatens to imperil his campaign for mayor even before it starts. Giambrone is expected to register and enter the race Monday.</p>
<p>His backers - expected to include manager John Laschinger, who ran David Miller's two successful campaigns - no doubt told Giambrone he had to get out ahead of the issue. Deal with it forthrightly and immediately or it will hang around the campaign like a bad case of H1N1 at a wine and cheese party.</p>
<p>So Giambrone stood there yesterday and offered few excuses.</p>
<p>Why has customer satisfaction plummeted under his watch, he was asked.</p>
<p>"It has become a growing concern. I don't know why," he offered. "We were focused on incredible expansion. At some point, we have to come back and focus on customer service."</p>
<p>The TTC should have been better prepared for the fare increase announcement, the run on tokens and the fiasco of crowd management following the shutdown on the Yonge subway in December, he said.</p>
<p>Subway fare booths will get new microphones to better communicate with patrons, he said. Cellphone users will be able to text a number at each transit stop to find out how close the next bus is. All but four subway stations will have time-of-next-train-arrival by year's end. And 50 new vending machines are to ease the purchase of tokens and Metropasses. As well, the TTC will develop a customer bill of rights guaranteeing good service.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked how the system will afford the changes being proposed, he said: "Changing the attitude across the entire organization" doesn't cost money.</p>
<p>While attitude change among the segment of staff that "don't get it" will be most difficult, chief general manager Gary Webster admits, motivation is building.</p>
<p>"They're embarrassed," he said, describing his staff's reaction to the cacophony of complaints he describes as "a bit of a feeding frenzy; a bit of a crisis. We're getting it from all sides: our customers, the media. It's painful to hear when you're proud of the TTC."</p>
<p>The political calculation is that the furor will subside, now that someone has taken responsibility. Years back, the TTC followed a similar script following a train crash and restored public confidence.</p>
<p>Giambrone and his backers should know there is no room for error. One more public relations disaster on the transit system and his candidacy for mayor is crippled.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they figured the 32-year-old took a big step.</p>
<p>"At his age, he's the real deal," Laschinger said last night. "He's mature beyond his years."</p>
<p>Royson James usually appears Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.</p>

</p>
<p>There's a crisis in agriculture. It's an oft-repeated statement, one that at times comes from beef and pork farmers, and other times from the grain or the fruit and vegetable growers. In fact, it seems as though there's always a crisis in agriculture – perhaps in different sectors at different times, but it always seems as if someone is teetering on the brink of disaster and asking for help.</p>
<p>I've written about this crisis in farming in this column before – and I also work for and with farmers on a daily basis so I know that the hurt is there and that it's real. Help is definitely needed, and given that agriculture is now considered by many to have surpassed the auto industry as the largest contributor to Ontario's economy, I don't think that's out of line. After all, what's at stake is not just our food but also 740,000 jobs across the entire agri-food industry.</p>
<p>It's true that sometimes there are specific, extenuating circumstances that will land a sector in crisis. BSE and H1N1 come to mind. And there are normal ups and downs in any industry, but the problems that have been plaguing agriculture are deeper. There's a need to look beyond the short-term causes – like a higher dollar, a closed border or a drastic spike in fertilizer prices – so that we can find a sustainable, long-term solution that will help ensure our farmers aren't forced to continuously lurch from crisis to crisis. It would also mean an end to the ongoing need for government help.</p>
<p>The answer for farmers – and taxpayers – may well lie in a national food policy or food strategy. It's something that Canada does not currently have, but it's high time we did.</p>
<p>Most of us – accustomed to supermarket shelves brimming with low-cost food – likely don't give food and farming issues a second thought. We have no concept of what it could mean to depend solely on other countries to provide us with what we eat. After all, we buy and use imported goods all the time: our clothes, our electronics, our household goods and many other everyday items.</p>
<p>But perhaps, along with worries about jobs, mortgages and credit card bills, we should spare a few minutes to consider how we want our children and grandchildren to live, and how we want them to nourish themselves. What kind of value should our society be placing on homegrown food? How important is it that we have farmers in our communities and in our economy? How can we protect and nurture our environment while at the same time sustaining food production for ourselves and others?</p>
<p>In Britain, the department for environment, food and rural affairs has just launched a national food policy. Food 2030, the British government's vision of what the nation's food system should look like 20 years hence, focuses on sustainable, environmentally responsible food production for both domestic and export markets, and how this can be achieved in the face of climate change and a growing global population. Alongside this is a focus on farmers who are competitive and profitable, and consumers who are informed and healthy eaters.</p>
<p>Here at home, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture has been advocating for a national food strategy and, together with other farm groups across the country, is involved in a consultative process to explore the issue further. The OFA began discussions around what this strategy could look like at meetings with its members across the province this month, and the Future of Food is the theme of the upcoming Canadian Federation of Agriculture annual conference.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the outcome will be an official food policy that can be adopted by Ottawa and the provinces to ensure a homegrown food supply that is sustainable for all – and in doing so, also spell an end to the ongoing crisis in agriculture.</p>

</div><div>ELIZABETH CHURCH   </div>

</p>
<p>EDUCATION REPORTER</p>
<p>The federal government has quietly put the brakes on plans to build an HIV vaccine-manufacturing facility in Canada, leaving researchers bidding on the project with no explanation as to why.</p>
<p>The $88-million initiative, which included an investment from Bill Gates's private foundation, was to be the centrepiece of Canada's efforts to combat the virus that leads to the devastating disease of AIDS. It was announced with much fanfare close to three years ago in Ottawa by Prime Minister Stephen Harper with the <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> founder at his side.</p>
<p>After several months of delays in selecting a winning bid, word spread last week among the four finalists about an unusual posting on the Public Health Agency of Canada website. The posting, which has since been removed, seemed to be saying the project was cancelled.</p>
<p>Then came calls to all the finalists from David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, late Friday afternoon. After comparing notes, they confirmed all had received the same bad news – no bid was selected.</p>
<p>“We are all puzzled,” said Jeremy Carver, chief executive officer of the International Consortium on Anti-Virals, one of the finalists. Dr. Carver, whose non-profit company is based on the campus of Trent University in Peterborough, Ont., said he was told the government was “considering their options.”</p>
<p>“No one is willing to say they are not going to do something,” he said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq contacted yesterday issued a written response, indicating the information on the website was “a result of an administrative error.”</p>
<p>“Moving forward, the Government of Canada and the Gates Foundation continue to work together with the aim of accelerating the development of a safe, effective, affordable and accessible HIV vaccine,” it said.</p>
<p>Ted Hewitt, vice-president of research at the University of Western Ontario, another finalist, said he is “pretty much convinced the competition is now dead.”</p>
<p>After two years of working on a bid and assembling a global network, he remains certain the need for the vaccine facility exists, as does the expertise in Canada. He said all four finalists, which also included the International Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg and Laval University, were willing to work together no matter who the winner was.</p>
<p>“Canada is the real loser,” he said.</p>
<p>Mostly, he expressed frustration at being left in the dark. “There may be good reasons and I accept that. I just wish it had been more transparent and we could have found out a lot earlier,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Carver said given this fall's swine-flu outbreak, the delay in a decision was understandable, but he is anxious to get feedback on his proposal and is trying to stay optimistic about future projects. “We are waiting and seeing and hoping the government will still go ahead and do something,” he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Change of Alberta health ministers no reason to halt reforms</b>
</div><div>David Maclean   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>
<div>855 words</div><div>25 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Is Premier Ed Stelmach waving a white flag on health reform?</p>
<p>We hoped the promotion of Edmonton MLA Gene Zwozdesky by Stelmach to health minister wouldn't signal a wholesale change in direction from that of outgoing minister Ron Liepert, but recent policy pronouncements by Zwozdesky suggest this may be the case.</p>
<p>In recent days, Zwozdesky cancelled the proposed closure of 300 acute-care beds in Edmonton and Calgary. This very well may have been the right move for the government and for patients, but Albertans can't afford to abandon reform efforts altogether.</p>
<p>To be sure, the past 18 months in Alberta health policy have been difficult. The confusing rollout of the H1N1 vaccine was the result of a dramatic miscalculation by Alberta Health Services of the demand for the vaccine. A mistake like this, during the rush of a largely unprecedented public health emergency, would be understandable had other provinces been in the same boat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Liepert and Alberta Health Services, other jurisdictions managed to sidestep vaccine rollout fiascos.</p>
<p>Proposed bed closures at Alberta Hospital, a move making little sense when Alberta lacks existing capacity to treat patients elsewhere, undermined public confidence in the government's ability to manage health care.</p>
<p>We could go on, of course, as others already have. But turning the page on recent disappointments shouldn't mean abandoning health reforms all together. After all, Albertans pay for top-of-the-line health care but only get mediocre results.</p>
<p>According to the independent Canadian Institute for Health Information, Albertans wait months in pain for knee and hip replacement surgeries and cancer patients wait weeks to access potentially life-saving radiation therapy. There are better ways out there. Europeans, for example, fare much better when it comes to wait times, access to specialists and overall costs.</p>
<p>After years of talk there are now a number of modest reforms underway to allocate tax dollars more efficiently. These efforts must continue.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is changing the way it pays for health services in some areas by adopting what they call "activity based funding." Later this year, nursing homes will be funded according to the needs of the patients cared for and payments will be standardized across the province.</p>
<p>Currently, hospitals and nursing homes receive funding in lump sums and every patient is viewed as a burden and a drain on that funding.</p>
<p>Activity-based funding means that the funding follows the patient, so the facility makes money with each new patient. This kind of funding was implemented in Denmark where health outcomes improved while costs diminished.</p>
<p>Activity-based funding is expected to be extended to all Alberta hospitals in 2011. This is a necessary reform that must continue, regardless of who sits in the Health Minister's chair.</p>
<p>Last year, AHS head Stephen Duckett pointed to a 2008 study indicating nurses spend 27 per cent of their day doing non-nursing work. He also flagged the high proportion of nurses working part time as a key productivity concern. The implication here is that nursing resources, one of the largest-spending envelopes in the health system, should be used more efficiently.</p>
<p>Duckett's straight talk netted him a code of conduct grievance filed by the United Nurses of Alberta accusing him of "bullying" nurses.</p>
<p>For years the health system has been criticized for failing to set performance targets and measure results. Now we're seeing some gradual progress on this front with increased transparency and reporting.</p>
<p>The health system can better use private health providers to efficiently increase capacity, but operators such as Vancouver-based Cambie Surgery Centre complain of having to wade through reams of red tape and a legal framework seemingly designed to prevent new entrants into the market.</p>
<p>But challenging the status quo requires political will to stand up against entrenched and overly ideological special interest groups like public sector unions and facilitate a "grown up" conversation about these issues.</p>
<p>Is Zwozdesky the person who will lead health reform, or is his appointment to the portfolio a sign the government is waving the white flag? Liepert became a lightning rod for public discontent with the health system.</p>
<p>Will Zwozdesky bring the modest reforms currently underway to a halt or apply his estimable communication skills to furthering them?</p>
<p>Premier Stelmach should give Zwozdesky a clear mandate to immediately ramp up health reform. More importantly, Stelmach's 68-member caucus must rally around this cause. It is, after all, the biggest public policy challenge of our time.</p>
<p>Let's be perfectly clear: True health reform isn't about reducing services and cutting spending. It's about fundamentally changing the way health services are paid for and provided. Albertans are ready for change so long as they see measurable benefits.</p>
<p>Now it's up to Zwozdesky and the rest of the government caucus to deliver that change.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Traffic deaths, injuries an ‘unnecessary epidemic'; High number of accidents involving pedestrians prompts call for more enforcement</b>
</div><div>LISA PRIEST   </div>
<div>702 words</div><div>25 January 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Pedestrians critically injured on city streets over the weekend have one injury researcher suggesting a law-and-order solution: make traffic enforcement a top priority.</p>
<p>“The greatest epidemic before us sure wasn't H1N1, it was injuries,” said Louis Francescutti, an Edmonton emergency medicine physician and director emeritus of the Alberta Centre for Injury Control and Research. “Traffic deaths are an unnecessary epidemic.”</p>
<p>So far this year, 12 pedestrians have died in traffic accidents in greater Toronto. And a 35-year-old man was in hospital in critical but stable condition with head injuries yesterday after being hit by a streetcar as he tried to cross Queen Street East mid-block while talking on his cellphone, putting him among the more than 2,000 pedestrians harmed each year in Toronto traffic collisions.</p>
<p>And yesterday at about 5:40 p.m., a woman in her 40s was hit by a car in the crosswalk at Carlingview and Dixon roads. Police told CTV the woman was taken to Sunnybrook Hospital with serious head injuries.</p>
<p>“What we're seeing across Canada is a worsening of the injury problem because we're really not paying attention,” said Dr. Francescutti, who has studied the issue for more than two decades.</p>
<p>Some pedestrians need a healthier respect for the road and to be aware of the dangers of walking while talking on a cellphone. And drivers – those who speed, are impaired, talk on cellphones or fail to obey signs – need to face law enforcement. Records show motorists are at fault roughly half of the time when there is a pedestrian fatality.</p>
<p>Increased traffic enforcement alone, said Dr. Francescutti, would spell a 50-per-cent reduction in such fatalities and a 20-per-cent reduction in crime, based on previous studies done in the United States. Educating pedestrians is also important, particularly about the little-known dangers of walking and chatting on a cell.</p>
<p>“They walk into signs; they get lacerations on their heads. They walk into intersections and get into pedestrian collisions. They fall off curbs, they fall into holes,” Dr. Francescutti said in a telephone interview from Edmonton. “It's as if they are blinded because of the distraction.”</p>
<p>Canada's pedestrian traffic injury rate is far higher than other countries, particularly compared with the European Union. Sweden in particular has low injury rates, in part due to beefed-up driver education and stringent enforcement, which includes pulling over motorists.</p>
<p>Drivers must also have their sight checked every decade with the renewal of their driver's license.</p>
<p>“We are really not making the progress we should be making; other countries are taking this problem seriously,” he said. “…The will is not there. I have not come across one community in Canada where I am looking over my shoulder; there's no enforcement anywhere in this country.”</p>
<p>Jan Kasperski, chief executive officer of the Ontario College of Family Physicians, said she believes cities like Toronto were built with cars in mind.</p>
<p>“Toronto is heading in the right direction with the number of condominiums, but it hasn't paid enough attention to how we move people and cars and bikes safely,” Ms. Kasperski said yesterday. “It's a little bit more risky to be out there on your feet and very risky to be out there on bicycles.”</p>
<p>Montreal faced a similar problem in 2006, when 27 pedestrians were killed and 183 seriously injured. It responded with police safety programs that target pedestrians in spring and fall. The result was a steep drop in deaths: In 2009, pedestrian fatalities were down to 19 and this year there have been no pedestrian deaths. Injuries were down, too, with 77 serious injuries in 2008, the latest figures available.</p>
<p>In Toronto the most recent figures for pedestrian injuries were for 2007, when 2,132 were injured. Whatever the number, it is always too high, as these deaths and injuries are seen as preventable.</p>
<p>“It really does pain the health industry when we see clusters [of pedestrian deaths and injuries] like this,” said Ms. Kasperski. “It's really quite frightening.”</p>

<p>Re: Free Trade Isn't Free, Buzz Hargrove, Jan. 19.</p>
<p>Buzz Hargrove uses the global financial crisis as an impetus to challenge globalization and free trade. Certainly globalization made the crisis global but let's not get confused -- it began as a financial crisis. His argument that "only active management of trade flows, to ensure that trade is fair, can ensure that everyone benefits from trade" really doesn't help much when what we're trading are, what Mr. Hargrove himself calls: "worthless paper," "lousy investments" and subprime mortgages. Mr. Hargrove hopes that "if nothing else comes out of the subprime disaster of 2008, it will be a realization that globalization is largely fraud, as are all the claims for the benefits of free trade." But isn't that like saying, "Let's shut down global air traffic due to swine flu's breach of the Mexican border?" No one says that; instead we shut down the flu.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what the lesson needs to be here: in an increasingly globalized world we need stronger regulation to provide checks and balances for the financial system.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 numbers down, but flu still a threat; Mid-Season. Still months to go, officials caution</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>477 words</div><div>23 January 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada is now well into its usual flu season and, while the H1N1 virus is still circulating and causing some deaths, it appears to have been kept at bay so far this year.</p>
<p>Surveillance reports from the Public Health Agency of Canada show that, in the first two weeks of January, the indicators used to determine influenza levels were either normal or even below what is expected for this time of year.</p>
<p>The number of people going to see their doctor for flu-like symptoms, for example, has been "significantly below" the average for early January, the report noted.</p>
<p>Since Jan. 3, there have been 47 hospitalizations due to H1N1 and eight admissions to the intensive care unit. Six deaths have been reported, bringing to 422 the total since the pandemic started.</p>
<p>Health officials were saying before Christmas that there was no way to know what the new year would bring and they were anticipating several potential scenarios. They included a third wave of H1N1, the possibility of it dying down as more people were immunized, and the seasonal flu strain taking hold.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is still the dominant virus, but so far a third wave has been avoided and the virus hasn't shifted in its composition.</p>
<p>About 45 to 50 per cent of the population received the H1N1 vaccine and thousands of Canadians have been infected with the virus, which has helped stem its spread, Brown said.</p>
<p>"The immunity in the population is probably quite solid so it's going to be hard for this virus to move around in the population," he said.</p>
<p>Brown cautioned, as many other experts do, that influenza viruses are unpredictable and it's unclear how the rest of the flu season will play out.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensive-care specialist in Winnipeg who has been at the forefront of H1N1 research, said while H1N1 flu levels are relatively low right now, he expects to see flu activity rise as the season goes on.</p>
<p>"We're certainly going to see some significant influenza during the regular influenza season," he said. A typical flu season lasts from November to April and Kumar said levels of activity tend to ramp up toward the end of this month and in February. Whether it will be the H1N1 virus that continues to dominate or not is still uncertain, he said.</p>
<p>In other parts of the world, H1N1 is still widespread and there are pockets where activity has been intense in recent weeks. North Africa, South Asia and areas of Eastern Europe - Poland, Austria, Estonia, Romania and Hungary are among the affected countries - are the regions where transmission has been highest, according to a World Health Organization update issued yesterday.</p>

<p>PART 20 -LE COMMUNISME (COMMUNISM)</p>
<p>In our apartment in Douarnenez, we do not have an ocean view. However, we do have a lovely view of a sardine cannery. The quickest route to the library, and to the pleasure port, runs along the massive and uncommonly ugly, white warehouse.</p>
<p>I prefer to go the long way.</p>
<p>Avia and Esme know we are taking the long way, when we are taking the long way, and scold me for it.</p>
<p>"That way," says Avia. "It's faster."</p>
<p>"I want to go to the mediatheque," says Esme. She thinks I might be playing a trick on them, like that time I said we were going Christmastree shopping and we all received the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"It smells better this way."</p>
<p>"Oh, Daddy," says Avia. "That doesn't matter."</p>
<p>She pulls me toward the sardine cannery and, unable to endure being mocked by a four-year-old, I submit. The smell doesn't bother them. Perhaps the faded white box reminds them warmly of Canadian architecture.</p>
<p>Sardines are healthy and delicious. When I was a kid, they were one of my Eastern European grandfather's favourite foods. The others were salty corned beef, heavily salted hardboiled eggs and beets with lots of salt on them, all of which I found repulsive. But I loved my grandfather and, since I broke his heart by not playing the violin, I sought culinary links with him. In this I have formed a lifelong allegiance with the mighty sardine.</p>
<p>Growing up in the 1970s and '80s, I honestly believed meat and fish came from the refrigerated section of the IGA. All of this ended one autumn evening in my early teens when we visited my uncle and aunt's farm not far from Ponoka.</p>
<p>It was time to chop the heads off a number of turkeys they had raised, and my cousin and brother and I took turns holding their heads while an adult wielded the axe. I was splattered with blood. The turkeys ran around a while, headless, before flopping to the ground. Everyone thought this was hilarious and I pretended to think it was funny as well, so as not to seem a sissy.</p>
<p>Eventually, I pretended to have a stomach ache and went inside the farmhouse to watch Halloween cartoons. Looking back, I suppose it was good trauma. Honest trauma. If we're going to eat meat, we ought to understand what it means.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What it means, for canned sardines in Douarnenez, is no more pleasant. The smell, on certain days, fills the downtown core. It isn't the smell of the fish market or even of the sea at low tide. It's the sour and clawing scent of waste and decomposition, and if it's nauseating three blocks away, the air inside the warehouse must be a genuine party.</p>
<p>There is a bar next to the cannery. I have stopped in a few times and the young men inside don't turn to make eye contact. They don't even talk to each other, at least not loudly enough to be overheard. They lean on the bar and stare straight ahead and drink their Belgian beer.</p>
<p>Ninety years ago, sardine canneries in Douarnenez did not benefit from modern air-circulation systems. Young men didn't work in the canneries. They were all out fishing.</p>
<p>Women did the canning, by hand, sitting directly next to each other in long lines. They often entered the usine when they were adolescents. They worked long hours for terrible pay, in hot and smelly or cold and smelly warehouses, then they went home to dry their husbands' nets, make dinner, wash clothes and raise children.</p>
<p>Traditionally, women in Brittany wore lace headgear which varied from community to community. In the pays de Douarnenez, the headgear and the work inspired the term Penn Sardines -- "sardine heads" in Breton. While the Penn Sardines worked, the owners of the canneries became wealthy and socialized in Paris.</p>
<p>All of this, taken together, resulted in Douarnenez electing the first communist mayor in France in 1921. A few years later, the women in Douarnenez went on strike. Others joined them. Someone tried to assassinate one of the strike leaders, a second communist mayor. Eventually, when their complaints were taken seriously, the Penn Sardines became folk heroes not only for Brittany, but also for communists all over France and Europe.</p>
<p>In Canada, especially during the Cold War, the word communist was sinister. Its accompanying images were of pale, high-cheekboned soldiers, nuclear bombs, bread lines, murderous dictators and the spooky Cyrillic alphabet.</p>
<p>Tossing the word "communist" around made it easy to avoid any complex discussions of the costs and benefits of deregulation, of privatizing government services and crown corporations. In my hometown, Pierre Trudeau -- the father of Canadian bilingualism and probably the reason I'm currently living in France -- was considered a French communist.</p>
<p>Even though it has been revealed, in the last couple of years, that unchallenged capitalism can be as ridiculous as communism, the word continues to have a special power. In his advice to Americans to avoid donating money to relief organizations working in Haiti, American commentator Rush Limbaugh blamed "communism" for Haiti's problems. If you don't want to bother thinking, there's always communism.</p>
<p>Le communisme, here in France, never quite reached the status of pure villainy. During the Second World War, French communists were closely aligned with the resistance. In some regions, they were the resistance. The Nazis being the Nazis, the communist party in France entered the 1950s with some serious cachet.</p>
<p>During the long presidency of Francois Mitterrand, the French left wing fought several internal battles that were not ultimately prosperous for the communist party. Now, the two main political organizations in France are the centre-right Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and the Socialist Party (PS).</p>
<p>The Parti communiste francais continues to exist. They received less than two per cent of the popular vote in the 2007 presidential elections, but there are a number of communist deputies in the national assembly, senators, mayors and French members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>I have tried to visit the communist party offices in Paris and here in Douarnenez, but the doors never seem to be open. No one answers the phone. This is just as well, as all I really want is a button or maybe a T-shirt. Avia and Esme would look really cute in some red communist party pyjamas. I would pay top euro for a furry hat from the Soviet Union with a hammer and sickle on it.</p>
<p>Bothering the communists with my consumerist desires probably isn't respectful. And I can't seem to get over my childhood fascination with the evil empire.</p>
<p>Todd: So. You're a communist.</p>
<p>French communist: Yes.</p>
<p>Todd: Did you ever see the movie Red Dawn? L'Aube rouge? With Patrick Swayze?</p>
<p>French communist: No.</p>
<p>Todd: How do you say 'commie' in French?</p>
<p>French communist: I don't know.</p>
<p>Todd: A real commie! You must like Lenin. Have you seen his tomb?</p>
<p>French communist: (sigh)</p>
<p>Awkward pause</p>
<p>Todd: Do you have any buttons? Communist pyjamas? I need a size five and a size three.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Today in North America, in the absence of any real communist threat -- even China seems resigned to state capitalism -- the political term we misuse as a synonym for "scary" or "dumb" is fascism. But none of this works as comedy in France. Both communism and fascism are part of the French national debate, even if they don't operate as popular movements anymore. The Second World War was born in ideas, after all, and they're still evacuating neighbourhoods to defuse Allied bombs on the coast of Brittany.</p>
<p>One of my friends in Douarnenez inherited a house with his sister, and because he can't afford to buy her out, they have to sell it.</p>
<p>"I don't really have a choice," he said in a serious tone. "We live in a capitalist system and there isn't anything I can do about it."</p>
<p>But the idea is alive here that citizens can do something about it, whatever something happens to be. The first round of the 2007 presidential election saw voter turnout of almost 84 per cent. Navigating around strikes is a part of daily life here, which is annoying and sometimes funny, but it's also inspiring.</p>
<p>Individuals and groups are not cynical or lazy about their political power, despite a rigid class system. They participate. Last month, in this city of 15,000, there was a gigantic musical parade of associations -- political, apolitical, artistic, athletic, incomprehensible -- that filled the streets and congregated in the central plaza.</p>
<p>I was expecting a speech. There wasn't a speech. But when it seemed the time was right, a man began playing a clarinet. Others joined in and then everyone danced down to the pleasure port to take part in a soup competition.</p>
<p>The winner was a woman who wore her ordinariness like a medal. "I wasn't trained," she said. "I didn't go to cooking school. I'm passionate about soup. I just want to share my soup."</p>

</p>
<p>Manitoba First Nations residents were disproportionately hit with severe H1N1 infection during the first wave of the virus last spring, a team of researchers has found.</p>
<p>University of Manitoba researchers examined 795 cases of H1N1 in the province from the time the outbreak started last April until Sept. 5, 2009. Sixty per cent of the 45 severe cases -- those requiring admittance to an intensive-care unit -- were from First Nations communities. The study was published in the online edition of the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>First Nations people represented 28 per cent of community cases, 54 per cent of hospitalization cases and 60 per cent of ICU cases, suggesting a genetic predisposition.</p>
